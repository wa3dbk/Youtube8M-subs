really long reload speed for that cannon

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.950 
really long reload speed for that cannon
on<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.190> kv-1s<00:05:12.670> just<00:05:13.030> playing<00:05:13.360> against<00:05:13.840> him

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
on the kv-1s just playing against him

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.710 
on the kv-1s just playing against him
there<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:15.250> t21<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:15.970> able<00:05:16.270> just<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.510> take

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
there and the t21 is able just to take

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.620 
there and the t21 is able just to take
him<00:05:16.960> out<00:05:17.169> before<00:05:17.410> he's<00:05:17.890> able<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.460> reload<00:05:18.880> he's

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
him out before he's able to reload he's

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.770 
him out before he's able to reload he's
got<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.810> couple<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.260> good<00:05:20.530> shots<00:05:20.560> on<00:05:21.010> that<00:05:21.780> what

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
got a couple of good shots on that what

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.530 
got a couple of good shots on that what
was<00:05:22.930> that<00:05:22.960> it<00:05:23.230> was<00:05:23.350> an<00:05:23.440> AMX<00:05:23.800> 12t<00:05:24.360> finished<00:05:25.360> him

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
was that it was an AMX 12t finished him

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.060 
was that it was an AMX 12t finished him
off<00:05:25.570> as<00:05:25.930> he<00:05:26.080> was<00:05:26.200> looking<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.890> wrong

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
off as he was looking in the wrong

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.430 
off as he was looking in the wrong
direction<00:05:27.130> there<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.940> bdr<00:05:28.360> though<00:05:28.600> looked

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
direction there the bdr though looked

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.690 
direction there the bdr though looked
like<00:05:29.620> his<00:05:29.830> turret<00:05:30.160> was<00:05:30.220> facing<00:05:30.580> this

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
like his turret was facing this

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.010 
like his turret was facing this
direction<00:05:30.850> so<00:05:31.150> he<00:05:31.300> doesn't<00:05:31.570> really<00:05:31.690> want<00:05:31.810> to

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
direction so he doesn't really want to

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.409 
direction so he doesn't really want to
tangle<00:05:32.320> with<00:05:32.380> him<00:05:32.500> as<00:05:32.800> that<00:05:32.970> BTW<00:05:33.970> i<00:05:34.090> should

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
tangle with him as that BTW i should

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.000 
tangle with him as that BTW i should
have<00:05:34.570> enough<00:05:34.810> initial<00:05:35.020> damage<00:05:35.350> to<00:05:35.650> be<00:05:35.770> able<00:05:35.860> to

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
have enough initial damage to be able to

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.540 
have enough initial damage to be able to
take<00:05:36.160> him<00:05:36.310> out<00:05:37.919> just<00:05:38.919> coming<00:05:39.130> around<00:05:39.310> he

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
take him out just coming around he

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.610 
take him out just coming around he
responds<00:05:40.030> out<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> kv-1<00:05:40.780> knew<00:05:41.230> that<00:05:41.410> he<00:05:41.500> would

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
responds out a kv-1 knew that he would

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.020 
responds out a kv-1 knew that he would
be<00:05:41.710> around<00:05:41.919> this<00:05:42.100> area<00:05:42.370> so<00:05:42.640> just<00:05:42.669> going<00:05:42.940> to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
be around this area so just going to

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.000 
be around this area so just going to
play<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.900> run<00:05:43.990> around<00:05:44.140> with<00:05:44.350> this<00:05:44.590> guy<00:05:44.830> as

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
play and run around with this guy as

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.890 
play and run around with this guy as
well<00:05:45.040> as<00:05:45.370> we<00:05:45.520> saw<00:05:45.669> earlier<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.210> kv-1<00:05:46.690> just

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
well as we saw earlier the kv-1 just

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.210 
well as we saw earlier the kv-1 just
definitely<00:05:47.260> doesn't<00:05:47.500> have<00:05:47.680> enough<00:05:47.919> turret

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
definitely doesn't have enough turret

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.030 
definitely doesn't have enough turret

21<00:05:51.550> he's<00:05:51.730> playing<00:05:51.970> a<00:05:52.060> little<00:05:52.210> bit<00:05:52.419> more<00:05:52.540> smart

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
21 he's playing a little bit more smart

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.590 
21 he's playing a little bit more smart
as<00:05:53.050> well<00:05:53.350> at<00:05:53.590> least<00:05:53.770> using<00:05:54.340> his<00:05:54.610> body

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.940 

well<00:05:58.600> not<00:05:58.810> traversing<00:05:59.320> his<00:05:59.440> body<00:05:59.620> but<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.860> was

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
well not traversing his body but it was

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.440 
well not traversing his body but it was
at<00:06:00.040> least<00:06:00.130> arriving<00:06:00.610> forward<00:06:01.030> so<00:06:01.240> that<00:06:01.270> the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
at least arriving forward so that the

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.430 
at least arriving forward so that the
t21<00:06:02.320> couldn't<00:06:02.800> get<00:06:02.920> around<00:06:03.250> him<00:06:03.750> his<00:06:04.750> forward

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
t21 couldn't get around him his forward

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.380 
t21 couldn't get around him his forward
momentum<00:06:05.590> was<00:06:06.010> enough<00:06:06.340> to<00:06:06.580> keep<00:06:06.790> him<00:06:07.060> level

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
momentum was enough to keep him level

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.180 
momentum was enough to keep him level
but<00:06:07.930> fortunately<00:06:08.260> wasn't<00:06:08.680> able<00:06:08.830> to<00:06:08.980> get<00:06:09.100> his

but fortunately wasn't able to get his

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.210 
but fortunately wasn't able to get his

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
turret on target on time before the t21

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.920 
turret on target on time before the t21
finished<00:06:12.730> him<00:06:12.880> off<00:06:12.910> and<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.360> was<00:06:13.480> his<00:06:13.600> fifth

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
finished him off and that was his fifth

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.960 
finished him off and that was his fifth
kill<00:06:14.200> of<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:14.470> match<00:06:14.650> so<00:06:15.460> just<00:06:15.640> going<00:06:15.730> to<00:06:15.820> come

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
kill of the match so just going to come

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.700 
kill of the match so just going to come
in<00:06:16.060> on<00:06:16.150> this<00:06:16.270> bdr<00:06:16.690> now<00:06:16.900> who<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.290> looks<00:06:17.500> like

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
in on this bdr now who it looks like

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.400 
in on this bdr now who it looks like
he's<00:06:17.830> focusing<00:06:18.310> on<00:06:18.520> larger<00:06:19.240> targets<00:06:19.660> at<00:06:20.170> the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
he's focusing on larger targets at the

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.570 
he's focusing on larger targets at the
front<00:06:20.680> there<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:21.040> it's<00:06:21.160> just<00:06:21.250> going<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.460> be<00:06:21.520> a

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
front there so it's just going to be a

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.980 
front there so it's just going to be a
case<00:06:21.850> of<00:06:22.000> just<00:06:22.120> coming<00:06:22.450> up<00:06:22.600> behind<00:06:22.720> him

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
case of just coming up behind him

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.260 
case of just coming up behind him
pumping<00:06:23.950> a<00:06:24.070> shot<00:06:24.250> into<00:06:24.370> his<00:06:24.490> rear<00:06:24.730> and<00:06:25.030> then

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
pumping a shot into his rear and then

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.780 
pumping a shot into his rear and then
taking<00:06:25.750> him<00:06:25.990> out<00:06:26.200> picking<00:06:26.650> up<00:06:26.830> his<00:06:27.040> sixth<00:06:27.490> kill

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
taking him out picking up his sixth kill

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.820 
taking him out picking up his sixth kill
of<00:06:28.030> this<00:06:28.600> match<00:06:28.840> so<00:06:29.110> far<00:06:29.140> so<00:06:29.500> that<00:06:29.620> just<00:06:29.800> leaves

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
of this match so far so that just leaves

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.640 
of this match so far so that just leaves
a<00:06:30.070> Churchill<00:06:30.460> mark<00:06:30.700> one<00:06:31.110> so<00:06:32.110> he's<00:06:32.230> gonna<00:06:32.350> leave

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
a Churchill mark one so he's gonna leave

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.590 
a Churchill mark one so he's gonna leave
his<00:06:32.680> allies<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.610> do<00:06:33.760> the<00:06:33.910> base<00:06:34.060> capture<00:06:34.330> while

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
his allies to do the base capture while

his allies to do the base capture while
he<00:06:34.720> hunts<00:06:35.020> out<00:06:35.140> this<00:06:35.500> Churchill<00:06:35.800> mark<00:06:36.250> one<00:06:36.490> so

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
he hunts out this Churchill mark one so

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.550 
he hunts out this Churchill mark one so
to<00:06:37.090> speed<00:06:37.450> it<00:06:37.570> up<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:37.750> little<00:06:37.870> bit<00:06:38.080> until<00:06:38.320> he

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
to speed it up a little bit until he

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.490 
to speed it up a little bit until he
finds<00:06:38.950> him<00:06:39.190> and<00:06:39.570> there<00:06:40.570> he<00:06:40.600> is<00:06:40.810> Churchill<00:06:41.260> mark
