00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
needs to get that stimulation also it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
needs to get that stimulation also it
works<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.930> plants<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.530> are

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
works really well for plants that are

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.469 
works really well for plants that are
suffering<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:32.009> frost<00:01:32.340> damage<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> does

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
suffering from frost damage what it does

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
suffering from frost damage what it does
is<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> stimulates<00:01:33.990> new<00:01:34.500> root<00:01:34.740> growth<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
is it stimulates new root growth and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.760 
is it stimulates new root growth and
this<00:01:35.549> will<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.850> sustain<00:01:36.090> strong<00:01:37.079> new<00:01:37.439> growth

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
this will then sustain strong new growth

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
this will then sustain strong new growth
and<00:01:38.040> flowering<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> planet<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.049> if

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.270 
summer this will stimulate strongly
growth<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.899> area<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.530> using<00:01:52.770> lots<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
growth the other area I'm using lots of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
growth the other area I'm using lots of
Cecil<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> moment<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.780> pots<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.380> can

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
Cecil at the moment is with pots you can

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
Cecil at the moment is with pots you can
imagine<00:01:55.770> during<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> summer<00:01:56.460> months<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
imagine during the summer months the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
imagine during the summer months the
plants<00:01:57.780> roots<00:01:58.110> grow<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.619> against<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> side<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
plants roots grow up against the side of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.319 
plants roots grow up against the side of
the<00:01:59.369> pot<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.880> where<00:02:00.060> they'd<00:02:00.210> normally

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the pot which is where they'd normally

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.539 
the pot which is where they'd normally
grow<00:02:00.689> naturally<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:02.070> pots<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.460> this

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
grow naturally but these pots and this

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.010 
grow naturally but these pots and this
ones<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.850> metal<00:02:03.210> pot<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.750> imagine

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
ones are metal pot so you can imagine

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
ones are metal pot so you can imagine
how<00:02:04.530> its<00:02:04.740> super<00:02:05.100> heats<00:02:05.280> during<00:02:05.549> summer<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
how its super heats during summer and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
how its super heats during summer and
with<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> roots<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.689> against<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> side<00:02:07.259> will

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
with the roots up against the side will

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400 
with the roots up against the side will
they<00:02:07.979> caught<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.229> plants

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
they caught now it's not good for plants

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
they caught now it's not good for plants
health<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.220> one<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.459> not

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
health and you can see this one is not

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.350 
health and you can see this one is not
super<00:02:11.940> happy

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
super happy

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.110 
super happy
so<00:02:12.569> doses<00:02:13.020> see<00:02:13.200> Sol<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.280> pot<00:02:14.489> itself<00:02:14.819> is

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
so doses see Sol in the pot itself is

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.760 
so doses see Sol in the pot itself is
gonna<00:02:15.390> make<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.750> world<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.260> difference<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
gonna make the world of difference to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.770 
gonna make the world of difference to
pot<00:02:17.489> plants<00:02:17.910> health<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> now's<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.569> time<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
pot plants health and now's the time to

be doing this because you're gonna
stimulate<00:02:20.160> really<00:02:20.520> good<00:02:20.670> growth<00:02:20.879> at<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> time

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
stimulate really good growth at a time

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.510 
stimulate really good growth at a time
when<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.080> no<00:02:22.170> longer<00:02:22.410> hot<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.250> other<00:02:23.280> thing

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
when it's no longer hot the other thing
