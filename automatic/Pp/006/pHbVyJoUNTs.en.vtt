 a kilo of pork loin for mecha 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.550
 when they ask him to mech, they make him 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.120
 holes to the meat to fill 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.900
 I'm going to ask 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.800
 they separate the little bone and here goes 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.940
 to be the pure flesh I will need 100 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.050
 grams of bacon a quarter of ham 6 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.980

 and 250 grams of peas a little bit of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.500
 ground pepper for the necessary 3 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 tablespoons of oil for frying and water 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 the necessary now let's do what 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.290
 next I'm going to wash the meat very 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.290
 all right 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.610
 for this power to fill the potatoes the 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.430
 I'm going to peel them and I'm going to chop them 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.770
 Boil the peas like us 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.369
 we can sew where nothing else but 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.280
 about 15 minutes let's let that 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.259
 boil only the peas and after 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.900
 we add the potato so that the potato does not 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.820
 he whips 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 the tomatoes and chilies 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.080
 and the cloves of garlic I'm going to put 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 boil together 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.230
 good and the meat now what 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.780
 let's do is fill it 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.700
 with ham and bacon I'm just going to 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.670
 occupy the jama half of ham in the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.450
 half of bacon in stuffing the meat that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.700
 it is called wicks 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 I'm going to fill in well all the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.719
 holes having meat 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.719
 a little ham 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.450
 another focus of bacon like this until they remain 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.190
 all this 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.570
 the openings of the meat 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.570
 already covered 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:33.129
 well here we can see that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.129
 fill the holes in the meat 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.569
 where they buy the meat they ask for 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.870
 mecha and in a single piece 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.909
 if it is not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.750
 they forgot to ask for a mecha 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:52.840
 You can do the same for yourself 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.850
 holes to be able to fight now that 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.660
 I'll do I'll put to sew 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.660
 with salt 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.430
 and two cups of water in the express pot 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.079
 it's only going to be 15 minutes 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.720
 and in normal pot approximately hour and 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.970
 half 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.760
 in the block while I forgot 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.710
 tell them that if they are going to cook the meat 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.330
 in conventional noia that is not express 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.950
 you have to add a little more 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.860
 water so it does not burn 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.260
 and now the other part that I'm left with 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.390
 bacon and ham I'll chop it in 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.240
 little squares and I'm going to 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.330
 Reserve 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.520
 well the meat is already cooked I'm going to 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.560
 take out of the pot 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.150
 and I'm going to dry it very well with a 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.390
 napkin since I know it well 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.470
 I'm going to put 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.470
 a little pepper 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.160
 and put it to fry 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.490
 I already have the oil heating up 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.210
 at low salaries 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:16.310
 since it's hot 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:18.799
 I'm going to put the meat is going to squeeze 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.129
 but after 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.129
 you get up 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.270
 so I'm going to see it 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.699
 I'm going to hit 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.470
 on the one hand on the other so until 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.470
 be totally sealed 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.860
 well here I already frei and I will follow it 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.860
 everywhere 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.270
 Now what I'm going to do is slice or 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:50.719
 cut into pieces as you this is 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.719
 I want them, I'm going to slice it like this 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.849
 I'm going to cut it down and right now 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:02.270
 what I'm going to do is grind the tomato 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.569
 with the cloves of garlic and onion and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.589

 what you reserve of ham 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.460
 and bacon 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.370
 I'm going to laugh a little 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.910
 since it is ready 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.910

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.780

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.920
