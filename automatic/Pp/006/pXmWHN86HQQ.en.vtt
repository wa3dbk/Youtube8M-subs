00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.750
 ap 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 we 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.150
 hello everyone knows the tagger 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.800
 today I find for a new 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.590
 video of the episode that applied the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 surviving in two raids then aboard 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.270
 whose first big part that will be 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.860
 on the water so water something 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.670
 of enough essential in z who lag 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.470
 simply because without water 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.269
 you will die so water is enough 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.670
 simple just do it yourself 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.350
 flasks here I am going to show all the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.850
 kraft violates not very difficult but of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.270
 water this but if you drink it can 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 that you had fun during there like that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.670
 and could even be so frankly 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.270
 do not do it except at the beginning of the game 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.890
 because it's really useful but otherwise 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.149
 warm your eyes back it's a con 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.270
 it is that you will have 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.740
 freshwater who she is and drinkable 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.109
 and in addition to that you will be given more 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:36.200
 two drops of water one tastes of water 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:37.340
 are represented by these I do not have 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.929
 to show you but I think you 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.009
 see above the hunger bar so 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.960
 that's what gives you a very nice 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.960
 freshwater hours 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:59.090
 you can simply transform the 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:01.369
 lot in purified water with a clean 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.360
 water that is made like these to 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.849
 your stick stick 6 l just put 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.319
 sir's back and skull sitter to 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.880
 side you will have a freshwater 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.290
 good against finally shooting the filter 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.579
 cleaner it says you will need the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.590
 string is that the string and you 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:26.300
 will have again inclined 8 hours 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.140
 so here is former main otc 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.280
 we can see that we can see that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.280
 in countries also do with buckets 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.950
 of water so if you cook under back has 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.349
 by cons I have not tested yet sorry 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.750
 but normally if we cooked if you 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.129
 heat a water source you 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.799
 will get a bucket of purified water 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:58.190
 normally engage on monday 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.810
 then before in another step so 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:07.790
 always related to the water the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:14.430
 first part pairs of eyes so the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.230
 first big part the water so for 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.579
 have some chocolate water there you 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.340
 just put a very nice 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.340
 sugar hours a farm two questions 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:33.970
 we pretend not be deceived ar 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.970
 because already some gaps or water 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:47.270
 as an excuse but we must already make a 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:51.710
 mini bottle havana and in addition you 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.500
 just put a jump from the east of 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.350
 vials you will get 3000 bottle etc 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.830
 6000 bottle just put the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.050
 1000 bottle made of sweet cocoa or too much 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.490
 would come a chocolate factory that 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:12.230
 normally regenerates thirst and hunger 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:14.590
 so here I have seen everything so we get 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.880
 found for the second part 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.160
 second part about food so 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.989
 food but not that already I'm going 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.530
 to show you something that I have 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.710
 forgot to show that these young people 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.130
 is water generator 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.130
 his part to do 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.330
 stone and sow that's it 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.950
 on it 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.110
 so that's food that can also 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.759
 normally you increase your thing 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.990
 of oneself finally rather reduce it so that 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.750
 walk almost with all the fruits 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.160
 so who did put one and then 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.850
 three fruits including 38 the a33 which speaks a 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.850
 little bug 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.039
 that's the change of season so we 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.410
 so are three fruits of the same type and 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.139
 for example strawberry 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:39.099
 when you will get a bottle of 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:41.320
 strawberry juice strawberry normally on 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.020
 gives you a little bit of speed so 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.789
 how to see cb i just know the case 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.770
 that's it you'll get relationship 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.660
 creative to have but normally you 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.979
 will get it so it's the same for the 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.680
 bananas you have to click 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.860
 right to support him and after could 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.860
 make 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:07.240
 so here we go 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:12.410
 so here is no for food 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.700
 because you can see everything he 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.200
 so I 'm not going to show you everything 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.330
 because otherwise I still have some for 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.970
 hours so we'll go right away to 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.260
 the third part here we are at the 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.310
 third and last part which 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.870
 will consist of showing you some 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.450
 little gadgets that can frankly 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.120
 you were dealing so the first one is called 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.289
 spyglass chip that allows you in zambia 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.839
 3 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.309
 to just look a lot more 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.219
 much further than the small fine is 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:38.719
 a lot more I do not know without the blood 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.119
 the f8 which is a little like that 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:44.930
 that's a lot practiced you can 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:46.550
 make the model that's it and for the 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.800
 top model is the end of six pay 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:54.259
 class so it will be when it replaces 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.729
 the iron with the one to make and with 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.860
 the golden one you believe there is when 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.479
 even a difference 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.059
 then we go straight to 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.009
 light so light there is the lantern 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.439
 can be very handy for 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:09.889
 lantern starts who scrapped like those 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:13.459
 This is then preferred lamp assist 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.719
 so with lanterns on the head that 

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:17.509
 have simply enlightened for your 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:19.550
 automatically so here it was 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:21.139
 third and last part this episode 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.449
 4 I hope it have pleased you hesitate 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:27.050
 not to like it is very important to 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:27.439
 commented also because you your opinions 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.969
 med 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.339
 frankly I had good feedback on 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:34.110
 this series so that's why you 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:35.610
 call episodes more regularly 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.270
 it is in any case much more two 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.230
 episodes so episode 2 we get them 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.390
 quail that will soon implode 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.420
 normally acquired that I will soon 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.780
 turn so here's me I tell you ciao 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.780
