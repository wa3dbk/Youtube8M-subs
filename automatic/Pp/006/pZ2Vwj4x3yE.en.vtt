and the reason you want to make sure

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.140 
and the reason you want to make sure
that<00:01:44.799> you<00:01:44.950> always<00:01:45.100> slide<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.610> back<00:01:45.820> rather

that you always slide it back rather

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.870 
that you always slide it back rather
than<00:01:46.420> forward<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.680> direction<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.790> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
than forward is the direction of the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.870 
than forward is the direction of the
hair<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:49.750> if<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.260> hair<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.530> laying<00:01:50.710> flat<00:01:51.100> and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
hair so if the hair is laying flat and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.450 
hair so if the hair is laying flat and
it's<00:01:52.030> going<00:01:52.210> towards<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.720> rear<00:01:53.530> that's<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
it's going towards the rear that's the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.710 
it's going towards the rear that's the
way<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.640> want<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.939> hair<00:01:55.119> laying<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.600> don't

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
way you want the hair laying you don't

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.929 
way you want the hair laying you don't
want<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.930> put<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.200> pad<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.130> pull<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.790> up

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
want to put that pad on and pull it up

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.609 
want to put that pad on and pull it up
so<00:01:58.150> all<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.360> hairs<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.170> wrong<00:01:59.350> way

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
so all the hairs going the wrong way

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.050 
so all the hairs going the wrong way
because<00:01:59.920> they'll<00:02:00.250> create<00:02:00.549> kind<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:00.880> rough

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
because they'll create kind of rough

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.270 
because they'll create kind of rough
spots<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.630> hot<00:02:01.780> spots<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.320> sometimes<00:02:02.680> that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
spots and hot spots and sometimes that

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.830 
spots and hot spots and sometimes that
will<00:02:03.430> kind<00:02:03.610> of<00:02:03.670> aggravate<00:02:04.150> those<00:02:04.360> horses<00:02:04.810> a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
will kind of aggravate those horses a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.999 
will kind of aggravate those horses a
little<00:02:05.140> bit<00:02:05.259> if<00:02:05.380> they've<00:02:05.530> got<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.710> little

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
little bit if they've got a little

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.830 
little bit if they've got a little
thicker<00:02:06.220> coat<00:02:06.549> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
thicker coat so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.779 
thicker coat so
again<00:02:08.080> we<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.440> throw<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:08.920> pad<00:02:09.280> up<00:02:09.550> there

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
again we have to throw that pad up there

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.030 
again we have to throw that pad up there
get<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.629> little<00:02:10.810> bit<00:02:10.989> higher<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.950> can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
get it up a little bit higher you can

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.589 
get it up a little bit higher you can
see<00:02:12.250> we've<00:02:12.400> still<00:02:12.550> got<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> babe<00:02:13.060> from<00:02:13.209> what<00:02:13.510> we

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
see we've still got a babe from what we

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.690 
see we've still got a babe from what we
did<00:02:13.750> over<00:02:14.050> there<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:15.010> I'll<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.310> pull<00:02:15.519> that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
did over there and I'll just pull that

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.460 
did over there and I'll just pull that
saddle<00:02:16.150> pad<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.629> slightly<00:02:16.930> bit<00:02:17.260> too

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
saddle pad just a slightly bit too

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.350 
saddle pad just a slightly bit too
towards<00:02:17.920> me<00:02:18.099> so<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.489> when<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.670> saddle<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.180> can

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
towards me so that when we saddle we can

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:29.690 
towards me so that when we saddle we can
adjust<00:02:19.480> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.760
