so<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.049> shooting<00:00:13.590> high-speed<00:00:14.160> flash

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
so in shooting high-speed flash

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.980 
so in shooting high-speed flash
photography<00:00:14.879> there's<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.450> couple<00:00:15.629> things<00:00:15.840> that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
photography there's a couple things that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.140 
photography there's a couple things that
we<00:00:16.080> need<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.439> consider<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.980> course<00:00:17.189> one<00:00:17.820> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
we need to consider of course one to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.400 
we need to consider of course one to
make<00:00:18.270> sure<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.599> have<00:00:18.750> flashes<00:00:19.200> that<00:00:19.289> are

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
make sure that we have flashes that are

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
make sure that we have flashes that are
able<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> read<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> master<00:00:20.910> unit<00:00:21.150> or

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
able to read with a master unit or

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
able to read with a master unit or
another<00:00:21.540> flash<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.110> triggering<00:00:22.470> each

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
another flash that are triggering each

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.800 
another flash that are triggering each
other<00:00:22.890> today<00:00:23.610> I'm<00:00:23.849> using<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.300> flashes

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
other today I'm using two flashes

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.060 
other today I'm using two flashes
because<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.020> wanted<00:00:25.289> even<00:00:25.410> light<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.919> both

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
because I wanted even light on both

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.250 
because I wanted even light on both
sides<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:27.240> subject<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:27.930> came<00:00:28.080> around

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sides of my subject as they came around

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.400 
sides of my subject as they came around
a<00:00:28.529> curve<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.660> that's<00:00:30.660> another<00:00:30.929> point<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.260> need

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
a curve and that's another point we need

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.350 
a curve and that's another point we need
to<00:00:31.439> consider<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.519> where<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.120> shoot

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
to consider here is is where we shoot

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080 
to consider here is is where we shoot
and<00:00:33.720> so<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.500> chose<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> curve<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.400> bike<00:00:35.640> path

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and so we chose a curve on a bike path

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.430 
and so we chose a curve on a bike path
so<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> biker<00:00:36.660> comes<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.320> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so when the biker comes around that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
so when the biker comes around that
corner<00:00:37.769> they're<00:00:38.220> leaning<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.120> lean

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
corner they're leaning and as they lean

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.780 
corner they're leaning and as they lean
it<00:00:39.660> adds<00:00:39.839> more<00:00:40.050> drama<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.890> me

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.330 

one<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> advantages<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> having<00:00:49.470> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
one of the advantages of having a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
one of the advantages of having a
location<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.480> where<00:00:51.750> we've<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> bi

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
location like this where we've got a bi

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180 
location like this where we've got a bi
curb<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.250> coming<00:00:53.550> by<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.770> in<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.920> spot

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
curb that's coming by and in a spot

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.290 
curb that's coming by and in a spot
where<00:00:56.220> we're<00:00:56.520> able<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.790> use<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.120> high-speed

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
where we're able to use the high-speed

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.720 
where we're able to use the high-speed
flash<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.829> other<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.220> can<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.610> we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
flash the other thing we can do is we

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.920 
flash the other thing we can do is we
can<00:00:59.850> decide<00:01:00.090> brethren<00:01:00.420> don't<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.720> trying<00:01:00.900> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
can decide brethren don't we trying to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.579 
can decide brethren don't we trying to
stop<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.470> action<00:01:01.650> there<00:01:02.400> was<00:01:02.520> still<00:01:02.790> enough

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
stop the action there was still enough

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.170 
stop the action there was still enough
darkness<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.890> shadow<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.369> mottled<00:01:05.970> light

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
darkness and shadow to mottled light

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
darkness and shadow to mottled light
where<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.720> able<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> say<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.770> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
where I was able to say well you know we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.830 
where I was able to say well you know we
get<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.070> tracing<00:01:08.520> highlights<00:01:08.910> let's<00:01:09.570> try<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
get these tracing highlights let's try a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:22.300 
get these tracing highlights let's try a
pan<00:01:10.110> shot<00:01:10.410> with<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.310> speed<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.060> flash

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.930 

fantastic<00:01:23.310> let's<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.820> try<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.850> I'm

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
fantastic let's go try this so what I'm

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.639 
fantastic let's go try this so what I'm
doing<00:01:26.970> now<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.600> I've<00:01:27.899> kind<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> changed<00:01:28.380> my

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
doing now is I've kind of changed my

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.070 
doing now is I've kind of changed my
direction<00:01:28.830> here<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:30.450> getting<00:01:30.539> shots<00:01:30.930> of

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
direction here and I'm getting shots of

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.020 
direction here and I'm getting shots of
our<00:01:31.200> biker<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> opposite

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
our biker now going the opposite

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
our biker now going the opposite
direction<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.450> high<00:01:33.600> speed<00:01:33.899> I'm<00:01:34.050> going<00:01:34.080> low

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
direction of high speed I'm going low

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
direction of high speed I'm going low
speed<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.580> other<00:01:35.700> words<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.300> my<00:01:36.420> camera

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
speed so in other words I put my camera

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.749 
speed so in other words I put my camera
setting<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> f-22<00:01:37.800> which<00:01:38.039> brings<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:38.460> shutter

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
setting to f-22 which brings my shutter

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
setting to f-22 which brings my shutter
speed<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.890> slowest<00:01:40.890> shutters<00:01:41.160> but<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
speed down the slowest shutters but I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370 
speed down the slowest shutters but I
can<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.789> getting<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> pan<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
can get some getting a pan and so with

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.320 
can get some getting a pan and so with
the<00:01:43.500> pan<00:01:43.800> now<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.520> getting<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> motion

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
the pan now I'm getting the motion

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.999 
the pan now I'm getting the motion
because<00:01:45.479> he's<00:01:45.690> coming<00:01:45.990> by<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.530> quickly

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
because he's coming by me very quickly

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.570 
because he's coming by me very quickly
as<00:01:47.160> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.210> he<00:01:48.330> comes<00:01:48.509> by<00:01:49.580> but

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
as you can see here as he comes by but

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.219 
as you can see here as he comes by but
my<00:01:50.729> strobes<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.240> still<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.660> off<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
my strobes are still going off which is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.169 
my strobes are still going off which is
great<00:01:52.440> because<00:01:52.649> I've<00:01:53.099> changed<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.849> flash

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
great because I've changed my flash

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.330 
great because I've changed my flash
setting<00:01:54.599> on<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> camera<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.709> rear<00:01:56.039> curtain

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
setting on the camera to rear curtain

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.460 
setting on the camera to rear curtain
sync<00:01:56.520> meaning<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> when<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.720> pan<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.349> him

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
sync meaning that when I pan with him

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.589 
sync meaning that when I pan with him
with<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> motion<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.610> flash<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.209> happening

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
with that motion my flash is happening

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.139 
with that motion my flash is happening
at<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.959> end<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.560> exposure<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.250> opposed<00:02:03.000> to

at the end of the exposure as opposed to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.699 
at the end of the exposure as opposed to
the<00:02:03.270> beginning<00:02:03.720> your<00:02:03.929> camera<00:02:04.289> comes<00:02:04.500> by

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
the beginning your camera comes by
