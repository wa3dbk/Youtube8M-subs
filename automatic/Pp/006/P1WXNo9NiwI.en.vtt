could just you know for michel combes

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.890 
could just you know for michel combes
think<00:04:07.400> your<00:04:07.550> xbox<00:04:07.880> details<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.810> know

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
think your xbox details and you know

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.660 
think your xbox details and you know
uploaded<00:04:09.350> skin<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.830> then<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.100> know<00:04:10.220> it's

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
uploaded skin and then you know it's

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.610 
uploaded skin and then you know it's
just<00:04:10.730> be<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.330> lot<00:04:11.870> cooler<00:04:12.110> because<00:04:12.320> then<00:04:12.500> you

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
just be a lot cooler because then you

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.380 
just be a lot cooler because then you
have<00:04:12.650> your<00:04:12.890> own<00:04:13.220> skin<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.760> learn<00:04:13.910> stuff<00:04:14.210> and

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
have your own skin to learn stuff and

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.850 
have your own skin to learn stuff and
we'd<00:04:14.480> be<00:04:14.570> pretty<00:04:14.780> much<00:04:15.050> like<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.500> see<00:04:15.530> which

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
we'd be pretty much like you see which

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.500 
we'd be pretty much like you see which
is<00:04:15.980> what<00:04:16.190> i<00:04:16.430> think<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:17.000> be<00:04:17.210> an<00:04:17.239> actual

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
is what i think that be an actual

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.260 
is what i think that be an actual
perfect<00:04:18.140> idea<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.770> yeah<00:04:18.950> that's<00:04:19.670> something<00:04:19.970> i

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
perfect idea so yeah that's something i

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.150 
perfect idea so yeah that's something i
really<00:04:20.870> like<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.290> see<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.590> well<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:21.980> big

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
really like to see so well the big

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.010 
really like to see so well the big
youtuber<00:04:22.580> i'd<00:04:22.670> be<00:04:22.880> campaigning<00:04:23.270> for<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
youtuber i'd be campaigning for this the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.960 
youtuber i'd be campaigning for this the
whole<00:04:24.320> time<00:04:24.560> because<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.700> seems<00:04:25.910> like

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
whole time because it just seems like

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.090 
whole time because it just seems like
something<00:04:26.240> that's<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:26.840> easy<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.320> do<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.710> maybe

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
something that's so easy to do and maybe

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.560 
something that's so easy to do and maybe
it<00:04:28.310> is<00:04:28.400> maybe<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:28.730> isn't<00:04:28.820> i<00:04:29.030> don't<00:04:29.270> really<00:04:29.390> know

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
it is maybe it isn't i don't really know

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.420 
it is maybe it isn't i don't really know
how<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.750> technical<00:04:30.170> side<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.950> maybe

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
how the technical side of it is maybe

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.040 
how the technical side of it is maybe
I'm<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.760> thinking<00:04:32.120> from<00:04:32.390> an<00:04:32.510> ignorant<00:04:32.870> point

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
I'm just thinking from an ignorant point

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.040 
I'm just thinking from an ignorant point
