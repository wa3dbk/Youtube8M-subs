00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 some strawberry seeds I'm 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.760
 trying to determine but I'm going to say one 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.369
 thing for you guys I had is research on 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 the internet in relation to how to plant a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.469
 angle how long it takes for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.700
 germinate takes a lot but I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.719
 I planted this seed has more or less 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 two weeks 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 we are now entering the third 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.629
 week and today 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 today I came here to take a look 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:58.260
 Look what a sprout has come from. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.159
 germinating a seed that this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.470
 seed said here seeing strawberry 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 after a long time I 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.350
 I pulled most of the other seeds 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.880
 which already germinated nei with ten days they 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.840
 imagine now strawberry delay 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000
 very 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.689
 and it looks like I put several and several 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.580
 seeds in the middle of a pot here that 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.710
 zinha to tell the story 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.310
 now this one 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 something may have not germinated 11 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:49.560
 O nl a seed of at least one year 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 With save this here is my second 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.619

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.299

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 opportunity and I was able to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.560
 complete any other time I put one 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.599
