00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.420
 today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.590
 particular where many will be united 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 different tastes 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.700
 what we do we make 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 rolls with chicken breast inside 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.320
 we will put some currant on it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.300
 then when we get there we will join this one 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 sauce we made with raspberries 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 the first thing we did is to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.349
 soak some dry bread then 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.720
 let's go squeeze it well take one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.920
 bulla and let's go and put the bread 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.070
 this is chicken breast 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.229
 I've already tried to trim it on 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.440
 as naturally as possible then i 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:49.229
 you see bits of wire waste 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.619
 these bits of here now we will go to 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:56.360
 chop them with the knife I will make a part of 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.360
 of the filling 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:14.820
 here you see they are pretty pieces 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:21.720
 coarse we go to come of the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.720
 not much parmesan to mix a 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 bit like that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.570
 let's take this marjoram 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.670
 marjoram this greater fresh and then 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.430
 there must be only a little perfume not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.430
 must be very strong flavor 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.310
 let 's take salt here is a nice round of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.310
 pepper 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.790
 at this point we knead with our hands 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.360
 you see it's almost like it's a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.050
 We take our kind of meatloaf 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.470
 chicken breast recipes 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.090
 I would say that the three slices are three 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.670
 rolls are more than sufficient a 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.420
 this point we must flatten them again 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.209
 more 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:22.270
 let's put the head so we fold 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:26.230
 we press the meat tenderizer I put the chicken 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:32.860
 between back to parchment paper for per 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:43.090
 avoid to isolate it 18 clear floor 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:44.560
 we must try to enlarge and 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.769
 we repeat the same operation also with 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.769
 the others 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:01.460
 we take back our filling and it 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.960
 go to stretch so considered 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.570
 which then we will have to try to close 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.880
 the spirit so we have to put 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:17.800
 the right amount to get it 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.800
 to close is the last slice 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:30.380
 let's take our own resigned 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:31.670
 let 's put the balls in here 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.950
 then at this point it is what we must 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.830
 do this we must try to close 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.600
 our rolls take some thread 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.600
 starting to close 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.260
 it really isn't important that it is 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.660
 perfect indeed it will make a lot of flavor too 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.430
 and let me have an idea 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.530
 look at this is an idea you make a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.220
 change while you are making recipe 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:05.830
 put the currant under the partner shelf 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:09.500
 so it will be much simpler 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:13.190
 manage the closure because the difficulty 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.590
 it was the fact that currant was moving 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.930
 continuously perfect considered in 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.910
 question however there are and therefore not eggs 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.750
 There is the danger, however, that many 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.750
 particularly 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:36.400
 a little salt and now we go into the oven 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.550
 at medium high temperature for about 20 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.550
 minutes 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:52.389
 it is certainly not necessary either 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:05:00.310
 turn them perfect but to resume it 1 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:05:03.180
 we want to take off thread here we go to 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.180
 rebuild in the roof 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:12.419
 this is a pass and remove it 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.099
 let's take our raspberry sauce 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.529
 these are simply coals 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.689
 which have been blended and then filtered 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.689
 of course to remove the saddle 

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:29.419
 at this point we put in the currant and 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:29.419
 white so a little oil on top 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:38.000
 and salt can be ours 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.420
 chicken roulade with currant a 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.420
 appetite
