 Hey guys this is my crf 250r 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.749
 2005 well maintained bike dinha 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.560
 I just did a reform 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:20.900
 recently and now I'm selling it not 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.590
 it's worth selling but doing what we 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.720
 it's no longer walking, it does not work any more 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.380
 So that's it, there's more, so let's go 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.010
 to the details I made of it 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.500
 recently 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.190
 so I did all the polishing of the frame 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.260
 huh 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.450
 So how can you see what I did? 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.720
 polished was a chrome detail of the 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.420
 do not compensate the board for not 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.860
 lose that brightness at the time of washing 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.420

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.000
 there the back here the spring this 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.520

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.630

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.450
 low 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.539
 besides the shock absorber I also changed the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.639

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.539

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:14.829

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:19.039
 Cube also took the blow and tried support is 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:21.859
 the axis of the scale also chromed 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.530

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.420
