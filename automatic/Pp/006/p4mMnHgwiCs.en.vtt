00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
we're going to move on to the dive on

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.520 
we're going to move on to the dive on
second<00:02:36.599> now<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.079> we're<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.349> try

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
second now and then we're going to try

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.410 
second now and then we're going to try
the<00:02:37.590> jump<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.340> work<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.730> seriously<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.299> can

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the jump or work that seriously we can

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.870 
the jump or work that seriously we can
get<00:02:39.510> him<00:02:39.599> off<00:02:39.660> top<00:02:39.870> off<00:02:43.129> there's<00:02:44.129> no<00:02:44.310> flick<00:02:44.730> at

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
get him off top off there's no flick at

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.390 
get him off top off there's no flick at
all<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.630> much<00:02:45.840> more<00:02:46.049> controlled<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
all then so it's much more controlled so

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.970 
all then so it's much more controlled so
you're<00:02:47.549> into<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> dive<00:02:48.030> good<00:02:48.870> little<00:02:49.859> bit

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
you're into the dive good little bit

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.760 
bend legs on the end but I'm being picky
the<00:02:52.290> first<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:52.799> pretty<00:02:52.859> good

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.080 

don't<00:02:56.770> just<00:02:57.010> about<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.310> dive<00:02:57.790> off<00:02:57.970> the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
pretty scared I've just jumped off the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140 
pretty scared I've just jumped off the
the<00:03:02.590> second<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> half<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:03.670> never<00:03:03.910> done

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
the second and a half but never done

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.449 
the second and a half but never done
anything<00:03:04.390> like<00:03:04.600> this<00:03:04.660> before<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.470> I've<00:03:06.280> had<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
anything like this before and I've had a

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.949 
anything like this before and I've had a
look<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.790> there<00:03:06.819> earlier<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.569> felt<00:03:07.750> really

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
look up there earlier and it felt really

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.840

scary<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:08.709> I'm<00:03:08.890> pretty<00:03:09.280> determined<00:03:09.640> I'm

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
scary but I'm pretty determined I'm

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:25.890 
scary but I'm pretty determined I'm
