00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.940
 beautiful staff who spoke Felipe well 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.260
 coming but the video here on the channel 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.450
 in this video here and now I want to show 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.940
 For you, a program here. 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.289
 improve and your audio will go a lot 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 warning you that it is not your pride of you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 record you talk to 7 7 5 and you will hear 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 still your computer 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 remembering that the day that will be here 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 in the description for you to download is for free 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 free and have to create a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 One contained rangers for you to be able to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.899
 enter the program 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.200
 But for that, come on, what he does is good. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.070
 Corn it installs a driver for you 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.260
 of sound and improvement and the quality of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 ctv sound begins to hear a thing that not 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.579
 a strand of some audio that is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.480
 accustomed to listening to play shooting game if 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.879
 She comes in the field and gets much better. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.090
 because it leaves sharper it leaves a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 investment is much more realistic and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.329
 it has a calibration system here 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.049
 what do you do to see if you said 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.760
 it shows and yours was said by ear 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.720
 what's your audio output in this box 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.229
 sound on your phone that is redfone such you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 calibrate where you're listening to ooo 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 Sound and I do not know if you can 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 monitor the sound and video direction of the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.020
 youtube 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 I think it depends a little more headset 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.270
 I here head to the show, it's there to see 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 perfectly set up is where the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 towards the sound you are listening to 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.860
 but then I'm leaving it normal here 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 Padrón advance in everything and there it is calibrated 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.320
 finish ok but not the program is this me 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 I'll even show you a demo here. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.090
 I'll stay here until I have not seen you 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.210
 which is one way they show and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.110
 how is the audio quality with this 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.110
 program is 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.330
 I think it's good here already , but God 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.670
 you saw that much improve pa 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.740
 quality then you can configure more 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.010
 things still kind ninja idc the volume 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.140
 robust but it's only an idea 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.780
 for those who already have a Jewish mother of audio 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.970
 I know nothing so I do not see 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.540
 no configuration of this one since the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.150
 program comes but now a little problem 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.730
 so maybe people will occur 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.970
 because it happened to me it is with this law as 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.400
 the driver appears it changed the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.070
 my r7 mail I had to go there 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.230
 settings here on the device. 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.200
 and will have these speakers 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.660
 here audio record you enable or 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.940
 disable depending on how he left 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.160
 because when I installed the device the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.550
 the headset because he left it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.110
 To the decon padrón you have to come here. 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.510
 For you right, that's the right button. 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.510
 notions production stage and you come here 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.269
 and barge enables it your your headset 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.250
 if you are not listening to the house be 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.760
 everything good I do not know if it is normal if it is a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.810
 It 's a good thing you're just a problem. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.280
 programmed and ok but I guess then 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.890
 It is very worthwhile to download this program. 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.110
 grace will leave nobody 's description for 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 You download but it's not that expensive. 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.560
 I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.320

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.060
