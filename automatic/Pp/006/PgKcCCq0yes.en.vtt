so I have to take a few other steps I'm

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.100 
so I have to take a few other steps I'm
sure<00:05:00.860> other<00:05:01.039> people<00:05:01.130> have<00:05:02.110> encountered

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.189 
but this was the message that I had used
easier<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.150> drop<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.600> out<00:05:08.720> through<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:08.960> back

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199
