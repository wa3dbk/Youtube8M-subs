00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
pulling that through pulling off the old

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.400 
pulling that through pulling off the old
loop<00:03:04.940> replacing<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.660> with<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.870> new<00:03:05.900> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
loop replacing it with the new and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.760 
loop replacing it with the new and
tightening<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.400> up<00:03:07.490> just<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.970> little<00:03:08.000> bit<00:03:08.240> and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
tightening it up just a little bit and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.310 
tightening it up just a little bit and
that<00:03:09.770> makes<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.670> same<00:03:10.970> type<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.570> knit<00:03:11.990> stitch

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
that makes the same type of knit stitch

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.130 
that makes the same type of knit stitch
as<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:13.280> flat<00:03:13.640> knit<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.600> also<00:03:14.750> called<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
as this flat knit it's also called a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.620 
as this flat knit it's also called a
unit<00:03:15.560> if<00:03:15.770> you<00:03:15.920> give<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> little<00:03:16.610> extra<00:03:16.970> slack<00:03:17.330> so

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
unit if you give a little extra slack so

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.540 
unit if you give a little extra slack so
it's<00:03:17.810> not<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.230> tight<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.040> that's<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.310> quicker

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
it's not so tight so that's a quicker

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.130 
it's not so tight so that's a quicker
way<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.880> knitting<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.360> I'll<00:03:20.450> do<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> second

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
way of knitting and I'll do a second

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.400 
way of knitting and I'll do a second
tutorial<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.070> if<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:23.000> need<00:03:23.320> help<00:03:24.320> with

new I'm gonna do my flat knit stitch
again<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:45.050> like<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.680> very<00:03:45.830> easy<00:03:46.269> and

again just like that it's very easy and
I<00:03:47.360> do<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:48.130> purl<00:03:51.130> down<00:03:52.130> below

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
I do a purl down below

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.690 
I do a purl down below
pick<00:03:53.450> up<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.780> purl<00:03:56.320> pull<00:03:57.320> off<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.650> old<00:03:57.860> put<00:03:58.580> on

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.300 
the new tighten that up go over the top
we're<00:04:03.140> gonna<00:04:03.260> do<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.530> flat<00:04:03.830> knit<00:04:04.760> stitch<00:04:05.180> here

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.240 

and<00:04:11.270> do<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.420> purl<00:04:11.830> that's<00:04:12.830> how<00:04:12.950> you're<00:04:13.100> going<00:04:13.190> to

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
and do a purl that's how you're going to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.940 
and do a purl that's how you're going to
end

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.160 

replace<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:22.030> loop<00:04:22.300> now<00:04:22.840> we're<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.110> to

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
replace that loop now we're going to

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.260 
replace that loop now we're going to
come<00:04:23.320> back<00:04:23.500> through<00:04:23.800> we<00:04:24.460> have<00:04:24.640> a<00:04:24.670> pearl<00:04:25.000> here

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
come back through we have a pearl here

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.390 
come back through we have a pearl here
so<00:04:25.450> we<00:04:25.570> want<00:04:25.780> an<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.320> go<00:04:26.440> on<00:04:26.620> top<00:04:26.920> of<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.220> to

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
so we want an it to go on top of it to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.090 
so we want an it to go on top of it to
create<00:04:27.760> this<00:04:27.940> seed<00:04:28.270> stitch<00:04:28.690> look<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.590> I'm

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
create this seed stitch look so I'm

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.230 
create this seed stitch look so I'm
actually<00:04:30.250> going<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:30.670> go<00:04:30.940> right<00:04:31.180> back

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
actually going to just go right back

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.720 
actually going to just go right back
over<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:31.960> one<00:04:36.600> knit<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.840> over<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.430> now

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
over this one knit that over and now

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.190 
over this one knit that over and now
we're<00:04:39.880> gonna<00:04:39.970> put<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:40.330> underneath<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.990> make

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
we're gonna put this underneath and make

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.990 
we're gonna put this underneath and make
this<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.440> pearl<00:04:41.800> again<00:04:42.070> because<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.640> was<00:04:42.700> an

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
this a pearl again because this was an

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.740 
this a pearl again because this was an
it<00:04:43.150> before<00:04:44.820> pull<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:45.970> back<00:04:46.240> through<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:51.070> you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
it before pull this back through if you

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.370 
it before pull this back through if you
this<00:04:52.750> isn't<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
this isn't it

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.200 
this isn't it
if<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:54.420> put<00:04:55.420> on<00:04:55.570> an<00:04:55.750> even<00:04:56.080> number<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.410> stitches

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
if you put on an even number of stitches

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.000 
if you put on an even number of stitches
then<00:04:58.210> you're<00:04:59.050> always<00:04:59.170> going<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.440> end<00:04:59.590> in<00:04:59.740> Pearl

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
then you're always going to end in Pearl

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.820 
then you're always going to end in Pearl
and<00:05:00.370> start<00:05:00.730> with<00:05:00.940> knit<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.660> it's<00:05:02.290> an<00:05:02.410> easy<00:05:02.590> way

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
and start with knit so it's an easy way

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.180 
and start with knit so it's an easy way
for<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.190> remember<00:05:03.460> if<00:05:03.730> you<00:05:03.820> have<00:05:03.940> an<00:05:04.060> odd<00:05:05.190> then

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
for you remember if you have an odd then

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.550 
for you remember if you have an odd then
you'll<00:05:06.370> have<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.640> really<00:05:06.940> keep<00:05:07.300> track<00:05:07.560> a

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
you'll have to really keep track a

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.990 
you'll have to really keep track a
little<00:05:08.890> bit<00:05:09.100> more<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:10.150> we<00:05:10.450> did<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:11.850> knit<00:05:12.850> stitch

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
little bit more so we did a knit stitch

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.390 
little bit more so we did a knit stitch
now<00:05:13.690> we're<00:05:13.840> going<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.020> go<00:05:14.110> back<00:05:14.260> with<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> pearl

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.570 

and<00:05:21.450> as<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:23.230> said<00:05:23.290> before<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:23.920> can<00:05:24.070> do<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.220> flat

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
and as I said before you can do a flat

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.140 
and as I said before you can do a flat
knit<00:05:25.090> stitch<00:05:25.420> or<00:05:25.810> do<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.530> other<00:05:27.160> way<00:05:27.310> do<00:05:28.120> a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
knit stitch or do it the other way do a

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.790 
knit stitch or do it the other way do a
flat<00:05:28.420> it's<00:05:28.690> going<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.930> just<00:05:29.290> go<00:05:29.440> straight<00:05:29.500> over

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
flat it's going to just go straight over

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.520 
flat it's going to just go straight over
like<00:05:30.160> this<00:05:30.430> if<00:05:30.670> you<00:05:30.850> make<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:32.500> can

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
like this if you make it you you can

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.890
