be<00:04:37.670> playing<00:04:38.180> video<00:04:38.480> games<00:04:38.840> during<00:04:39.170> work<00:04:39.350> hours

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
be playing video games during work hours

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.560 
be playing video games during work hours
or<00:04:39.950> we'd<00:04:40.190> catch<00:04:40.430> him<00:04:40.580> taking<00:04:40.940> naps<00:04:41.210> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.360 
or we'd catch him taking naps and
frankly<00:04:42.410> that's<00:04:42.560> not<00:04:42.740> acceptable<00:04:43.010> behavior

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
frankly that's not acceptable behavior

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.000

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
and so this is the system this is what I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.100 
and so this is the system this is what I
end<00:04:46.190> up<00:04:46.280> doing<00:04:46.340> now<00:04:46.730> all<00:04:47.030> day<00:04:47.060> sitting<00:04:47.810> and
