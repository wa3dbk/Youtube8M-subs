00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
output to look really nice so this is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.060 
output to look really nice so this is
completely<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.140> didn't<00:00:55.410> take<00:00:55.800> anything

we're happy to move forward with the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.190 
we're happy to move forward with the
beta<00:01:42.810> units<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.729> we'll<00:01:45.299> crank<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:46.020> as

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
beta units and we'll crank this out as

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600 
beta units and we'll crank this out as
quickly<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.770> possible<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> make

up<00:01:50.040> things<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.640> found<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:52.640> get<00:01:53.640> those<00:01:53.790> half

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
up things that we found I get those half

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000 
up things that we found I get those half
of<00:01:54.090> people's<00:01:54.390> hands

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010
