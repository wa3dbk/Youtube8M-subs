at<00:00:19.009> cybernetic<00:00:19.970> outbreak<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.900> game<00:00:21.439> that<00:00:21.800> well

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
at cybernetic outbreak a game that well

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.359 
at cybernetic outbreak a game that well
this<00:00:23.119> is<00:00:23.180> three<00:00:23.660> for<00:00:24.079> three<00:00:24.259> now<00:00:24.649> on<00:00:24.829> me<00:00:25.070> lying

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
this is three for three now on me lying

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.459 
this is three for three now on me lying
to<00:00:25.700> you<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.119> I'm<00:00:26.239> doing<00:00:26.419> really<00:00:26.809> well<00:00:26.989> I'm

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:27.469 
to you so I'm doing really well I'm

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:30.040 
to you so I'm doing really well I'm
keeping<00:00:27.980> up<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.460> trend<00:00:28.820> actually<00:00:29.630> mind<00:00:29.869> you<00:00:30.020> I

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
keeping up the trend actually mind you I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.499 
keeping up the trend actually mind you I
do<00:00:30.200> think<00:00:30.619> this<00:00:30.770> was<00:00:31.219> in<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.700> hacking<00:00:32.059> contest

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
do think this was in the hacking contest

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.510 
do think this was in the hacking contest
last<00:00:32.840> year<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.070> might<00:00:34.250> have<00:00:34.370> been<00:00:34.489> a

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
last year but it might have been a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.850 
last year but it might have been a
private<00:00:35.059> entry<00:00:35.450> I<00:00:35.660> know<00:00:36.140> it<00:00:36.379> was<00:00:36.530> something

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
private entry I know it was something

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.790 
private entry I know it was something
extra<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:37.460> didn't<00:00:37.790> play<00:00:37.969> it<00:00:38.120> back<00:00:38.390> then<00:00:38.800> so

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
extra and I didn't play it back then so

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.329 
extra and I didn't play it back then so
I<00:00:40.280> guess<00:00:40.609> maybe<00:00:40.999> I'm<00:00:41.269> only<00:00:41.420> half<00:00:41.809> lying<00:00:42.339> anyway

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
I guess maybe I'm only half lying anyway

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.610 
I guess maybe I'm only half lying anyway
I'm<00:00:43.429> doing<00:00:43.579> this<00:00:43.850> thing<00:00:44.120> live<00:00:44.420> today<00:00:44.870> because

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
I'm doing this thing live today because

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.310 
I'm doing this thing live today because
I<00:00:45.649> don't<00:00:45.920> think<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.429> post<00:00:46.879> commentary<00:00:47.600> response

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
I don't think a post commentary response

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.739 
I don't think a post commentary response
is<00:00:48.589> gonna<00:00:48.769> be<00:00:48.980> enough<00:00:49.280> for<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:49.609> also<00:00:50.510> I'm

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
is gonna be enough for this also I'm

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
for this because this is actually a 32x

for this because this is actually a 32x
ROM<00:01:10.370> right<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.600> hack<00:01:11.930> for<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.259> 32x

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
ROM right now like a hack for the 32x

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.910 
ROM right now like a hack for the 32x
and<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.659> that's<00:01:15.259> very<00:01:15.880> interesting

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
this once before but it was an older

changed so I don't even know if I was

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.410 
changed so I don't even know if I was
able<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.520> initially<00:02:08.420> beat<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.690> lot<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.050> these

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
able to initially beat a lot of these

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.890 
able to initially beat a lot of these
before<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.610> almost<00:02:11.790> beat<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.390> version

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
before and I almost beat this version

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.479 
before and I almost beat this version
last<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> only<00:02:13.920> problem<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.459> that

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
last time but the only problem was that

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.580

I<00:02:14.880> ran<00:02:15.390> into<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> bit<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.050> glitch<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
