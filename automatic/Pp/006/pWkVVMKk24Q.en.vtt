00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969
 so force on such a threshold is interesting 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.150
 applications well first is 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.070
 ooo, you can recognize her toys 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.070
 so 2 ms 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.329
 unfortunately toys from grain paintings 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.039
 so there is a brake and in 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.210
 principle of non-standard 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.159
 hiding behind 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.159
 captive 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 ii 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.300
 it is necessary to find you yourself 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.950
 departments 3 4 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.220
 of interest then sad note polaris 40 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.980
 acres 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.570
 According to the next 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.880
 office for 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.880
 reading various documents 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.180
 it comes also 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 immediately in his 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.540
 tablet 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.590
 and since 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.620
 transformer 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 from known to you was allocated 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 horror stories and moved 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.380
 on the track but in this case im 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.840
 in Perm what is the percentage so much 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 unique 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 in terms of speed, it is no different 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.740
 not so fast he is all considered as 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.980
 torso and scream office 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.530
 there were problems with can dwell the same there 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.020
 but decided to edit 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.360
 more pleasant 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.130
 in this case, for some reason 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.359
 scrolling demolition faster and zoning 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.620
 just that swimming 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.560
 and also 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.420
 at the top 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.300
 there is a main function 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.310
 do export it a certain color 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 write something 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.790
 to change 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.790
 orientation 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.779
 of the five font size will find a profit 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.189
 Confucius is all made in a lawsuit 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.419
 nicely 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.059
 generally good 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.679
 apophis 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.169
 not without flaws but for now 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.309
 may well be with the same bake in 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.399
 convenience plan 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.649
 Nina typing plan view 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.649
 text in something inferior 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.349
 percentage by application of this kind 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.159
 but concerns that would like to point this out 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.099
 keyboard 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.560
 extra but let's see 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.079
 standard 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.079
 by running for example questions 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.559
 Sorokovikov percentage of course it is quiet 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.299
 horror because first you need 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.069
 stop him he 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.169
 language with two push what he 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.109
 many lead 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.579
 to a standstill after using lamps 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.879
 android 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.629
 ai background 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.450
 and for example even blackberry 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.330
 customer can purchase very 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.159
 quickly 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.389
 also they therefore respond with the fact that 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.109
 additional characters 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.939
 above not only 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.299
 budget committee member on idea 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.619
 mesnil get a cube but then sells eat 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.339
 death option get we get 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.699
 that is, three hours until May 31 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.000
 and we were told, for example, not even tun 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.289
 point of view that is 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.349
 but it costs us 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.319
 to switch 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.139
 he described in location but 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.589
 similar suits and bombs 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.589
 put use risk delivery 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.590
 Well, here we do not print the case of honor 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.759
 happens pretty fast moon 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.869
 not without flaws 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:00.269
 and in this case more interesting of course 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.959
 is an 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.099
 besides who lives three foci 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.329
 cinema works 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.839
 is it something to attract Islam keep god well 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:09.769
 so here we are 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.769
 all necessary functions 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.359
 we can calmly fans 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.559
 there is an extra 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.599
 planning 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.909
 companies that are 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.259
 for sure you do not know the world is boiling experienced 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.550
 buttons 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.969
 that's just a symbol 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.189
 taxi drivers keyboard 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.169
 she is also a joystick 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.729
 and suddenly it seems that they have not added 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.710
 automatic order switching 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.069
 in Russian 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.439
 This is a problem that promises nothing. 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.719
 eliminate 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.169
 we'll see 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.449
 hope that 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.039
 coming soon 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.619
 good keyboard which can be 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:53.430
 put used languages 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.550
 but with gusto 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.979
 All major applications can 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.689
 also toshak mitich 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.520
 things like a flashlight 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.309
 push and his alliance 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.669
 in a day 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:08.999
 candle 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:10.819
 generally 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.819
 where do without him 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:17.629
 In principle, the dossier was stopped by Viktor 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.499
 I would like to show the whole of Europe 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.669
 games as we see here dance considered tearing down 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.169
 unique quality bought head 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.979
 aids their wedding has achieved that 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.830
 the rest are 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.809
 but want minor 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.330
 the other side also 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.580
 and in this case interesting
