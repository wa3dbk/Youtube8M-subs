00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:09.390
 hello today we are going to make a little bag 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.950
 Christmas gift on diary paper 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.920
 we are going to need paper every day 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:22.010
 cardboard to reinforce 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:26.080
 pencil rule glue strips for 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:30.790
 the handles and some ornament 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.400
 we start the task we are going to cut here 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.829
 more or less three of a bit so that 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.859
 be 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.379
 cut the bag and let's fold one two 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:48.910
 or three centimeters this is going to be the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.540
 top part here we are going to paste 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.260
 a card reinforcement I have here 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.100
 some strips already cut to put as 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 reinforcement 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.450
 at the border 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.980
 so that the edge of the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.820
 bag 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.090
 I'm also going to hit two reinforcements here 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 this is to be able to drill the holes 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 for the handle 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.930
 now we put glue 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.920
 two and a half centimeters we take 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.920
 inside 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.869
 we talk 56 meters 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.320
 now we drill where the handles go 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.160
 first we saw here I was 21 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.240
 centimeters as 7 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.790
 7 here we could drill with the scissors 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.570
 but since I have the drill 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.570
 I prefer to do it with him 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.140
 to 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.040
 then I take two laces sites 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.040
 and with a needle threaded 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.660
 and we can put an ornament for 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.660
 Christmas a little star like this 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.730
 the card 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.569
 of how this card is made for embellishment 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:58.189
 You can also make this other ornament 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.189
 with the federal Christmas chair
