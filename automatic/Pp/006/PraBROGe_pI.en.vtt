00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
now I'm going to be to be comparing two

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.320 
now I'm going to be to be comparing two
boards<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.780> have<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.859> sector<00:00:05.250> nine<00:00:05.430> sandwich<00:00:06.000> I

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
boards I have the sector nine sandwich I

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.470 
boards I have the sector nine sandwich I
had<00:00:06.810> sector<00:00:07.319> nine<00:00:07.529> ala<00:00:07.799> moana<00:00:08.210> these<00:00:09.210> are<00:00:09.360> two

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
had sector nine ala moana these are two

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
had sector nine ala moana these are two
great<00:00:09.660> boards<00:00:10.050> they<00:00:10.170> both<00:00:10.320> feature<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.040> going

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
great boards they both feature the going

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.919 
great boards they both feature the going
style<00:00:11.550> under<00:00:11.790> trucks<00:00:12.090> they're<00:00:12.660> from<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
style under trucks they're from the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.810 
style under trucks they're from the
southbounders<00:00:13.110> she's<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> second<00:00:13.920> line<00:00:14.070> well<00:00:14.790> I

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
southbounders she's a second line well I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640 
southbounders she's a second line well I
guess<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> from<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> bamboo<00:00:16.260> series

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
guess this one is from the bamboo series

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.750 
guess this one is from the bamboo series
and<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.949> one's<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> Sidewinder

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and that one's from the Sidewinder

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
and that one's from the Sidewinder
series<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.119> they<00:00:18.210> both<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.680> I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
series but they both have now so I

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.900 
series but they both have now so I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
change in this board really actually

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
change in this board really actually
takes<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.299> pretty<00:01:24.720> good<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
doesn't show very much and on my section

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.520 
doesn't show very much and on my section
9<00:01:28.470> Ala<00:01:28.650> Moana<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:30.180> board<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.229> mean<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
9 Ala Moana this board just I mean it's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
9 Ala Moana this board just I mean it's
a<00:01:31.590> good<00:01:31.770> board<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a good board but you know I think that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.210 
a good board but you know I think that
sector<00:01:34.259> nine<00:01:34.409> could<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.740> done<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.070> bit

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
sector nine could have done a little bit

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
sector nine could have done a little bit
better<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.150> all<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.110> did<00:01:37.409> was

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
better with it because all I did was

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
better with it because all I did was
take<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> risers<00:01:38.340> off<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.790> about<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.030> week<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
take the risers off for about a week and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
take the risers off for about a week and
I<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.380> huge<00:01:41.130> cracks<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> middle

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I got huge cracks right down the middle

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
I got huge cracks right down the middle
I<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> piece<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.110> whole<00:01:43.439> bamboo<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I have a piece of whole bamboo that I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
I have a piece of whole bamboo that I
can<00:01:44.369> actually<00:01:44.490> pull<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.149> take<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
can actually pull up and take out of the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.859 
can actually pull up and take out of the
board<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.340> mean<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.399> got<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.909> cracks<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.509> along

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
board I mean I got just cracks all along

don't<00:02:17.320> know<00:02:17.380> why<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.190> looks<00:02:18.340> like

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
don't know why I think it looks like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.660 
don't know why I think it looks like
eglee<00:02:18.750> hideous<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:21.070> know<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.430> one's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
eglee hideous and you know so this one's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.180 
eglee hideous and you know so this one's
you<00:02:21.850> know<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.120> apply<00:02:22.360> canadian<00:02:22.960> maple<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
you know you apply canadian maple and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.810 
you know you apply canadian maple and
this<00:02:24.370> one<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:25.110> 5-ply<00:02:26.110> bamboo<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.670> can

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
this one is 5-ply bamboo and you can

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.430 
this one is 5-ply bamboo and you can
actually<00:02:27.970> see<00:02:28.150> there's<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.750> big<00:02:29.140> difference

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
actually see there's a big difference

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.320 
actually see there's a big difference
between<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.160> heights<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.550> these<00:02:30.760> two<00:02:30.970> boards

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
between the heights of these two boards

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.630 
between the heights of these two boards
I<00:02:31.600> want<00:02:32.590> furthest<00:02:32.920> from<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> camera<00:02:33.520> is

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
I want furthest from the camera is

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.060 
I want furthest from the camera is
obviously<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> drop<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.200> one<00:02:35.350> closest<00:02:35.890> is

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
obviously the drop the one closest is

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.660 
obviously the drop the one closest is
the<00:02:36.580> top<00:02:36.790> mount<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.860> mean<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.550> know<00:02:39.640> I

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the top mount and I mean you know I

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.130 
the top mount and I mean you know I
think<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.060> they're<00:02:40.209> both<00:02:40.330> good<00:02:40.570> boards<00:02:40.959> but

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
think that they're both good boards but

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.670 
think that they're both good boards but
if<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.670> know<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> had<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.180> say<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.690> buying<00:02:44.260> one<00:02:44.440> I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
if you know I had to say in buying one I

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.770 
if you know I had to say in buying one I
would<00:02:45.489> definitely<00:02:45.640> buy<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> sandwich<00:02:46.630> is

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
would definitely buy the sandwich is

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.300 
would definitely buy the sandwich is
just<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.080> better<00:02:47.230> all-around<00:02:47.500> board<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.160> it's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
just a better all-around board and it's

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.080 
just a better all-around board and it's
just<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.820> lot<00:02:49.510> funner<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.930> ride<00:02:50.110> in<00:02:50.290> my<00:02:50.410> opinion

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
just a lot funner to ride in my opinion

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.070 
just a lot funner to ride in my opinion
you<00:02:52.090> know<00:02:52.209> there's<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.510> difference<00:02:52.930> right

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
you know there's a difference right

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.860 
you know there's a difference right
there<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> right<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.870> took<00:02:56.110> these<00:02:56.410> two<00:02:59.670> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
there and the right I took these two and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.050 
there and the right I took these two and
that's<00:03:01.870> about<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:03.400> both<00:03:03.550> got<00:03:03.760> really

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that's about it they both got really

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.660
