this<00:00:24.450> is<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.599> polyurethane<00:00:25.230> wheel<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.040> this

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
this is a polyurethane wheel and this

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.639 
this is a polyurethane wheel and this
hardness<00:00:27.239> of<00:00:27.450> this<00:00:27.599> wheel<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.899> designed<00:00:28.500> for

offer<00:00:30.239> some<00:00:30.540> good<00:00:30.720> durability<00:00:31.399> going<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.489> from

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
offer some good durability going on from

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
offer some good durability going on from
there<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> bearings<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.630> these<00:00:33.750> guys<00:00:33.930> are

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
there the bearings on these guys are

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.070 
there the bearings on these guys are
going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:34.980> ABEC<00:00:35.430> 5<00:00:35.460> bearings<00:00:36.330> so<00:00:36.930> it's

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
going to be some ABEC 5 bearings so it's

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.350 
going to be some ABEC 5 bearings so it's
kind<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.380> solid<00:00:37.890> mid-range<00:00:38.490> bearing<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.330> it
