rotates adding a gear or removing a
single<00:01:04.580> gear<00:01:04.940> would<00:01:05.600> reverse<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.320> direction

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
single gear would reverse that direction

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.450 
single gear would reverse that direction
their<00:01:08.570> role<00:01:08.840> would<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:09.500> more<00:01:09.950> towards

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
their role would be more towards

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.080 
their role would be more towards
providing<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.539> conduit<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.830> power<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:13.880> they

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
providing a conduit for power so they

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.660 
providing a conduit for power so they
just<00:01:14.240> take<00:01:14.479> over<00:01:14.780> from<00:01:15.229> one<00:01:15.500> gear<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:15.979> pass<00:01:16.520> it

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
just take over from one gear and pass it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.870 
just take over from one gear and pass it
on<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.119> next<00:01:17.479> one<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.369> this<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.430> how<00:01:19.700> it

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
on to the next one and this is how it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.780 
on to the next one and this is how it
moves<00:01:20.150> let<00:01:20.570> us<00:01:20.689> see<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.320> motion<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:22.640> can

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
moves let us see it in motion so you can

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.980 
moves let us see it in motion so you can
see<00:01:23.030> at<00:01:23.299> every<00:01:24.040> engagement<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.970> at<00:01:26.270> every<00:01:26.570> pair

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
see at every engagement so at every pair

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.670 
see at every engagement so at every pair
the<00:01:27.979> direction<00:01:28.520> gets<00:01:28.880> reversed<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.439> red

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
the direction gets reversed so the red

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.340 
the direction gets reversed so the red
gear<00:01:31.009> moves<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.850> anti-clockwise<00:01:32.780> direction

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
gear moves in anti-clockwise direction

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.830 
gear moves in anti-clockwise direction
clockwise<00:01:33.680> anti-clockwise<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.330> clockwise

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
clockwise anti-clockwise and clockwise

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.830 
clockwise anti-clockwise and clockwise
again<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.130> velocity<00:01:37.610> ratio<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
again and the velocity ratio is just the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.560 
again and the velocity ratio is just the
function<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.130> number<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.460> teeth<00:01:40.790> on<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
function of the number of teeth on the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.170 
function of the number of teeth on the
first<00:01:41.869> gear<00:01:42.170> z1<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.130> number<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.640> teeth<00:01:43.909> on<00:01:44.090> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
first gear z1 and number of teeth on the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
last gear z4 here and that is going to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.569 
last gear z4 here and that is going to
give<00:01:47.240> us<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.360> velocity<00:01:48.110> ratio<00:01:48.259> now<00:01:49.009> since<00:01:49.369> all

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
give us a velocity ratio now since all

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.940 
give us a velocity ratio now since all
these<00:01:49.880> gears<00:01:50.270> are<00:01:50.590> connected<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.740> each<00:01:51.829> other

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
these gears are connected to each other

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.440 
these gears are connected to each other
engaging<00:01:52.369> with<00:01:52.610> each<00:01:52.640> other<00:01:52.939> forming<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.420> chain

engaging with each other forming a chain

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.889 
engaging with each other forming a chain
all<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.710> them<00:01:54.920> must<00:01:55.640> have<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.060> same<00:01:56.299> module<00:01:56.570> or

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
all of them must have the same module or

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.800 
all of them must have the same module or
the<00:01:57.049> same<00:01:57.229> pitch<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.000> therefore<00:01:59.000> their<00:01:59.210> sizes

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the same pitch and therefore their sizes

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.530 
the same pitch and therefore their sizes
will<00:02:00.590> be<00:02:00.619> linearly<00:02:01.130> directly<00:02:01.880> proportional

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
will be linearly directly proportional

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.940 
will be linearly directly proportional
to<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.259> number<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.530> teeth<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.100> there

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.010 
to the number of teeth that there
now<00:02:05.700> suppose<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.120> want<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.720> very<00:02:06.930> large

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
now suppose you want to get a very large

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
now suppose you want to get a very large
velocity<00:02:07.860> ratio<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.520> would<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> mean<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
velocity ratio what would it mean that

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.440 
velocity ratio what would it mean that
would<00:02:09.600> mean<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.259> ratio<00:02:11.039> Z<00:02:11.340> 4<00:02:11.640> upon<00:02:11.940> Z<00:02:12.120> 1<00:02:12.300> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
would mean the ratio Z 4 upon Z 1 is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.500 
would mean the ratio Z 4 upon Z 1 is
very<00:02:12.750> large<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.319> therefore<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.880> size<00:02:15.209> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
very large and therefore the size of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.890 
very large and therefore the size of
your<00:02:15.780> first<00:02:16.110> or<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> last<00:02:16.620> gear<00:02:17.130> will<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.910> much

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
your first or the last gear will be much

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.030 
your first or the last gear will be much
larger<00:02:19.140> than<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.180> other<00:02:21.180> one<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.830> may

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
larger than the other one and this may

of<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.410> compound<00:03:08.070> gear<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.239> speed<00:03:09.570> will

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of that compound gear so the speed will

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780 
of that compound gear so the speed will

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.600 
reduce from the red to this green speed
will<00:03:11.970> reduce<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:12.959> at<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> same<00:03:13.470> speed<00:03:13.829> the

will reduce but at the same speed the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.180 
will reduce but at the same speed the
smaller<00:03:15.510> part<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.560> also<00:03:16.890> start

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
smaller part of it will also start

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.150 
smaller part of it will also start
rotating<00:03:17.660> which<00:03:18.660> engages<00:03:19.019> with<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.410> larger

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
rotating which engages with the larger

rotating which engages with the larger
part<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:22.019> blue<00:03:22.530> gear<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.940> lower<00:03:24.600> speed

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
part of this blue gear that lower speed

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.340 
part of this blue gear that lower speed
is<00:03:25.110> given<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.650> smaller<00:03:26.190> part<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.350> then

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
is given to this smaller part and then

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.770 
is given to this smaller part and then
it<00:03:28.560> engages<00:03:28.920> with<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.610> purple<00:03:30.030> gear<00:03:30.269> which

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
it engages with this purple gear which

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.590 
it engages with this purple gear which
rotates<00:03:31.230> even<00:03:31.500> slower<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.269> way<00:03:33.420> we<00:03:33.570> are

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
rotates even slower so this way we are

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.420 
rotates even slower so this way we are
getting<00:03:33.840> reduction<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.590> speed<00:03:34.860> at<00:03:35.100> every

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
getting reduction in speed at every

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.550 
getting reduction in speed at every
engagement<00:03:35.579> from<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.390> red<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.870> green<00:03:37.079> from

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
engagement from this red to green from

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.160 
engagement from this red to green from
this<00:03:37.739> green<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.250> blue<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.030> from<00:03:39.390> blue<00:03:39.630> to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
this green to blue and from blue to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.729 
this green to blue and from blue to
purple

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
purple

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.009 
purple
so<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.190> stages<00:03:41.700> we<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.209> achieve<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
so in stages we can achieve the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.380 
so in stages we can achieve the
reduction<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:43.950> speed<00:03:44.190> or<00:03:44.400> increase<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.180> speed

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
reduction in speed or increase in speed

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.310 
reduction in speed or increase in speed
if<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.570> are<00:03:45.690> moving<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.110> other<00:03:46.140> direction

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
if you are moving in the other direction

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.090 
if you are moving in the other direction
and<00:03:47.329> we<00:03:48.329> can<00:03:48.480> achieve<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.780> very<00:03:48.959> large<00:03:49.500> velocity

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
and we can achieve a very large velocity

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.060 
and we can achieve a very large velocity
ratio<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:51.480> here<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.959> see<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.620> velocity

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
ratio so here you can see the velocity

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.670 
ratio so here you can see the velocity
ratio<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.549> not<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:54.239> decided<00:03:55.110> by<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.320> first

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
ratio is not just decided by the first

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.069 
ratio is not just decided by the first
and<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.070> last<00:03:56.190> gear<00:03:56.519> but<00:03:57.239> all<00:03:57.600> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
and the last gear but all the

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.289 
and the last gear but all the
intermediate<00:03:58.829> gears<00:03:59.160> contributed<00:04:00.090> and

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
intermediate gears contributed and

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.699 
intermediate gears contributed and
therefore<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.780> are<00:04:00.810> seeing<00:04:01.079> all<00:04:01.230> these<00:04:01.440> terms

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
therefore you are seeing all these terms

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.970 
therefore you are seeing all these terms

the intermediate years this is how it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.770 
the intermediate years this is how it
rotates<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.769> see

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
rotates so you can see

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.210 
rotates so you can see
our<00:04:13.469> first<00:04:13.859> gear<00:04:14.219> here<00:04:14.640> is<00:04:15.530> rotating<00:04:16.530> much

our first gear here is rotating much

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.310 
our first gear here is rotating much
faster<00:04:17.699> as<00:04:17.880> compared<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.259> you
