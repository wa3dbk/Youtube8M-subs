everyone<00:00:09.380> so<00:00:09.620> I<00:00:09.650> wanted<00:00:10.040> to<00:00:10.219> address

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
everyone so I wanted to address

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.600 
everyone so I wanted to address
something<00:00:10.969> that<00:00:11.410> often<00:00:12.410> crops<00:00:12.830> up<00:00:13.039> on<00:00:13.190> counter

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
something that often crops up on counter

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.730 
something that often crops up on counter
especially<00:00:14.539> when<00:00:14.719> I'm<00:00:15.019> trying<00:00:15.349> to<00:00:15.500> match

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
especially when I'm trying to match

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.620 
especially when I'm trying to match
people<00:00:16.099> to<00:00:16.189> a<00:00:16.219> foundation<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.970> it's<00:00:17.419> when

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
people to a foundation and it's when

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.290 
people to a foundation and it's when
people<00:00:18.529> come<00:00:18.800> in<00:00:18.980> looking<00:00:19.759> for<00:00:20.060> a<00:00:20.090> foundation

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
people come in looking for a foundation

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.359 
people come in looking for a foundation
to<00:00:20.689> match<00:00:20.869> their<00:00:21.169> tan<00:00:21.470> but<00:00:21.800> they<00:00:21.890> don't<00:00:22.099> have

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
to match their tan but they don't have

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.410 
to match their tan but they don't have
the<00:00:22.610> tan<00:00:22.880> on<00:00:23.180> them<00:00:23.810> so<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:24.680> um<00:00:25.099> it<00:00:25.789> seems<00:00:26.060> like

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
the tan on them so this um it seems like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.330 
the tan on them so this um it seems like
pretty<00:00:27.260> common<00:00:27.500> sense<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.800> me<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.070> I<00:00:28.130> think

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
pretty common sense to me and I think

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.589 
pretty common sense to me and I think
like<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:28.609> for<00:00:28.849> a<00:00:28.910> lot<00:00:29.060> of<00:00:29.150> other<00:00:29.300> people<00:00:29.510> would

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
like it for a lot of other people would

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.120 
like it for a lot of other people would
be<00:00:29.750> common<00:00:29.990> sense<00:00:30.019> but<00:00:30.470> you<00:00:30.859> would<00:00:31.009> be

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
be common sense but you would be

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.830 
be common sense but you would be
surprised<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:32.029> amount<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.390> people<00:00:32.540> who<00:00:32.660> come

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
surprised the amount of people who come

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.020 
surprised the amount of people who come
in<00:00:32.989> who<00:00:33.440> just<00:00:33.680> assume<00:00:34.100> you'll<00:00:34.670> be<00:00:34.699> able<00:00:34.879> to

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
in who just assume you'll be able to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.400 
in who just assume you'll be able to
give<00:00:35.150> them<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.390> perfect<00:00:35.540> match<00:00:35.809> for<00:00:35.839> Foundation

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
give them a perfect match for Foundation

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.229 
give them a perfect match for Foundation
and<00:00:36.589> it<00:00:36.650> really<00:00:36.920> really<00:00:37.129> isn't<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.059> case

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
and it really really isn't the case

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.579 
and it really really isn't the case
because<00:00:39.370> tans<00:00:40.370> can<00:00:40.760> vary<00:00:40.970> in<00:00:41.269> tone<00:00:42.080> they<00:00:42.409> can

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
because tans can vary in tone they can

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.609 
because tans can vary in tone they can
be<00:00:42.739> gold<00:00:42.920> based<00:00:43.370> for<00:00:43.729> bronze<00:00:44.000> based<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.780> and

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:45.619 
be gold based for bronze based and and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:47.410 
be gold based for bronze based and and
also<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.369> can<00:00:46.519> show<00:00:46.850> up<00:00:46.940> a<00:00:47.030> little<00:00:47.210> bit

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
also it can show up a little bit

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.789 
also it can show up a little bit
different<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.750> different<00:00:47.809> people's<00:00:48.379> skin<00:00:48.619> and

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
different on different people's skin and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.770 
different on different people's skin and
it<00:00:48.860> depends<00:00:49.250> on<00:00:49.369> how<00:00:49.790> thick<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.269> put<00:00:50.449> on<00:00:50.540> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
it depends on how thick you put on the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.829 
it depends on how thick you put on the
tan<00:00:51.170> how<00:00:51.530> many<00:00:51.680> layers<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.720> whether<00:00:53.720> you<00:00:53.809> use

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
tan how many layers and whether you use

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.630 
tan how many layers and whether you use
a<00:00:53.930> light<00:00:54.170> runner<00:00:54.470> dark<00:00:54.769> one<00:00:55.010> stuff<00:00:55.280> like<00:00:55.460> that

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
a light runner dark one stuff like that

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.990 
a light runner dark one stuff like that
so<00:00:56.269> always<00:00:56.690> if<00:00:57.500> possible<00:00:58.190> come<00:00:58.489> in<00:00:58.640> with<00:00:58.850> your

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
so always if possible come in with your

tan Ani when you're trying to get much
for<00:01:01.339> Foundation<00:01:01.939> and<00:01:02.299> it<00:01:02.600> just<00:01:02.809> makes<00:01:02.960> life

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
for Foundation and it just makes life

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.060 
for Foundation and it just makes life
easier<00:01:03.650> on<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.890> easier<00:01:04.369> on<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.580> artist<00:01:04.970> and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
easier on you easier on the artist and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.950 
easier on you easier on the artist and
it'll<00:01:07.070> save<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.280> lot<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:08.119> know<00:01:08.270> medicine

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960

and I know that I understand that can

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.580 
and I know that I understand that can
happen<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.799> if<00:01:31.219> you're<00:01:32.079> tossing<00:01:33.079> off<00:01:33.350> between

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
happen but if you're tossing off between

happen but if you're tossing off between
a<00:01:33.679> copper<00:01:33.950> tank<00:01:34.189> otters<00:01:35.229> always<00:01:36.229> err<00:01:36.469> on<00:01:36.499> the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
a copper tank otters always err on the

a copper tank otters always err on the
side<00:01:37.069> of<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.670> lighter<00:01:37.850> color<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.990> because

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
side of the lighter color just because

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.440 
side of the lighter color just because
it's<00:01:39.770> safer<00:01:40.280> dangle<00:01:40.789> for<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:40.999> dragon<00:01:41.299> color

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
it's safer dangle for the dragon color

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.389 
it's safer dangle for the dragon color
with<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.689> lighter<00:01:41.929> color<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.009> bronze

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
with a lighter color you can just bronze

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.609 
with a lighter color you can just bronze
up<00:01:43.609> a<00:01:43.729> little<00:01:43.909> base<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.659> know<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.200> little

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
up a little base you know is a little

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.830 
up a little base you know is a little
bit<00:01:45.829> more<00:01:46.039> natural<00:01:46.549> than<00:01:46.819> going<00:01:47.119> for<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:47.390> darker

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
bit more natural than going for a darker

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.719 
bit more natural than going for a darker
color<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.350> then<00:01:48.649> Elisha<00:01:48.950> body<00:01:49.219> which<00:01:49.460> just

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
color and then Elisha body which just

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.999 
color and then Elisha body which just
never<00:01:49.939> looks<00:01:50.179> well<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.990> always<00:01:51.289> try<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.799> have
