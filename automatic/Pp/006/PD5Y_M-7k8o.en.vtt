that you can get some really nice warm

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.369 
that you can get some really nice warm
core<00:00:14.340> sounds<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.180> some<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.600> cool<00:00:15.779> flanger

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
core sounds and some really cool flanger

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.550 
core sounds and some really cool flanger
sounds<00:00:16.860> so<00:00:17.670> let's<00:00:17.820> take<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> look<00:00:18.270> at<00:00:18.360> it<00:00:18.560> you

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
sounds so let's take a look at it you

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.750 
sounds so let's take a look at it you
have<00:00:19.680> 5<00:00:20.010> controls<00:00:21.320> starting<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.440> death

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
have 5 controls starting with death

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.880 
have 5 controls starting with death
which<00:00:23.760> sets<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.630> intensity<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.530> effect

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
which sets the intensity of the effect

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.270 
which sets the intensity of the effect
you<00:00:26.180> have<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:28.230> level<00:00:28.470> which<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.190> course

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
you have the level which is of course

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.450 
you have the level which is of course
the<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.700> main<00:00:30.090> output<00:00:30.539> level<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.129> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the the main output level you have the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
the the main output level you have the
rate<00:00:33.410> which<00:00:34.410> sets<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> speed<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
rate which sets the speed of the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.370 
rate which sets the speed of the
modulation<00:00:37.220> you<00:00:38.220> have<00:00:38.460> tone<00:00:39.060> with<00:00:40.020> tone<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
modulation you have tone with tone you

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.340 
modulation you have tone with tone you
can<00:00:40.790> cut<00:00:41.790> back<00:00:42.000> high<00:00:42.300> frequencies<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
can cut back high frequencies to get a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.970 
can cut back high frequencies to get a
more<00:00:43.860> warm<00:00:44.310> vintage<00:00:44.880> kind<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.239> sound

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
more warm vintage kind of sound

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.260 
more warm vintage kind of sound
regeneration<00:00:46.980> only<00:00:47.460> works<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> flanger

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
regeneration only works in the flanger

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
regeneration only works in the flanger
mode<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.170> sets<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.680> amount<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
mode and that sets the amount of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
mode and that sets the amount of
feedback<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:51.660> turn<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> up

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
feedback so you can if you turn it up

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.870 
feedback so you can if you turn it up
you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.649> some<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:53.010> crazy<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.790> of

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
you can get some really crazy kind of

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040 
you can get some really crazy kind of
sounds<00:00:54.469> ok<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.730> right<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.809> can

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
sounds ok and then right there you can

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.459 
sounds ok and then right there you can
set<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.620> input<00:00:58.770> level<00:00:59.570> depending<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.290> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
set the input level depending on if you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.650 
set the input level depending on if you
play<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.100> guitar<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.730> single<00:01:03.149> coils<00:01:03.540> or

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
play the guitar with single coils or

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.780 
play the guitar with single coils or
humbuckers<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.860> may<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> adjust<00:01:05.399> that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
humbuckers you may want to adjust that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.289 
humbuckers you may want to adjust that
to<00:01:06.090> avoid<00:01:06.570> distortion<00:01:07.500> coming<00:01:08.219> in<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.909> let's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to avoid distortion coming in so let's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.010 
to avoid distortion coming in so let's
check<00:01:09.509> it<00:01:09.600> out

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.990 

ok<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:14.740> I'm<00:01:14.920> going<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.130> play<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> bit<00:01:15.640> while

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
ok so I'm going to play a bit while

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940 
ok so I'm going to play a bit while
turning<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.509> knobs<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.619> give<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.829> an

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
turning the knobs just to give you an

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.450 
turning the knobs just to give you an
idea<00:01:18.039> what<00:01:19.000> they<00:01:19.149> do<00:01:19.539> to<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.899> sound<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.560> want<00:01:21.369> to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
idea what they do to the sound I want to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:30.440 
idea what they do to the sound I want to
start<00:01:21.609> with<00:01:21.670> tone

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 

see<00:01:30.840> how<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> cuts<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> frequencies<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> high

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
see how it cuts the frequencies the high

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:44.630 
see how it cuts the frequencies the high
frequencies

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:54.890 

of<00:01:45.030> course<00:01:45.300> death<00:01:46.970> will<00:01:47.970> intensify<00:01:48.540> effect

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:13.180 

and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.710> rate

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.190 

if<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.400> turn<00:02:14.640> right<00:02:14.909> all<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.360> way<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.959> get

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
if you turn right all the way up you get

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.330 
if you turn right all the way up you get
kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> tremolo<00:02:17.909> legacy

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.300 

and<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.140> my<00:02:28.530> favorite<00:02:28.890> set

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and this is kind of like my favorite set

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:39.770 
and this is kind of like my favorite set
up<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> nice<00:02:30.090> horse<00:02:30.390> sound
