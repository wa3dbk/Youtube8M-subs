00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
have to work really hard to drive

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.610 
have to work really hard to drive
traffic<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.600> get<00:02:27.900> exposure<00:02:28.290> for

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
traffic and do you know get exposure for

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.710 
traffic and do you know get exposure for
your<00:02:28.770> site<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.760> took<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.210> while<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> learn

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
your site so it took a while to learn

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.570 
your site so it took a while to learn
that<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.780> because<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> didn't<00:02:34.170> give<00:02:34.320> up

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
that and and because I didn't give up

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.860 
that and and because I didn't give up
you<00:02:35.580> know<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> couple<00:02:35.790> years<00:02:36.180> later<00:02:36.300> things

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you know a couple years later things

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.020 
you know a couple years later things
started<00:02:37.260> taking<00:02:37.830> off<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
started taking off and I think the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.070 
started taking off and I think the
biggest<00:02:39.240> shift<00:02:39.660> for<00:02:39.960> me<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.910> was<00:02:42.080> was

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
biggest shift for me that was was

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.740 
biggest shift for me that was was
changing<00:02:43.680> my<00:02:43.830> mindset<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.240> know<00:02:45.270> I'd

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
love to say that it was a specific you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.910 
love to say that it was a specific you
know<00:02:48.360> miracle<00:02:48.960> technique<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.590> i<00:02:49.620> learned

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
know miracle technique that i learned

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.510 
know miracle technique that i learned
that<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.700> exploded<00:02:51.570> everything<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
that just exploded everything and and to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.490 
that just exploded everything and and to
be<00:02:53.610> honest<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.210> few<00:02:54.540> things<00:02:54.750> like

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
be honest there was a few things like

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350 
be honest there was a few things like
search<00:02:55.710> engine<00:02:56.040> optimization<00:02:56.760> pay-per-click

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
search engine optimization pay-per-click

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.900 
search engine optimization pay-per-click
there<00:02:57.810> was<00:02:57.990> some<00:02:58.320> individual<00:02:59.040> tactics<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.760> i

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
there was some individual tactics that i

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.720 
there was some individual tactics that i
learned<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:02.040> know<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.310> really<00:03:02.580> did

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
learned that you know that really did

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
learned that you know that really did
take<00:03:02.910> things<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.330> next<00:03:03.420> level<00:03:03.690> but<00:03:04.170> but

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
take things to the next level but but

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.470 
take things to the next level but but
what<00:03:05.100> started<00:03:05.520> all<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.820> was<00:03:06.000> changing<00:03:06.390> my

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
what started all that was changing my

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.720 
what started all that was changing my
mindset<00:03:06.840> about<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.770> can<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
mindset about you know I can do this and

mindset about you know I can do this and
and<00:03:09.770> really<00:03:10.770> thinking<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.340> lot<00:03:11.490> bigger<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.830> you

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
and really thinking a lot bigger and you

and really thinking a lot bigger and you
know<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.370> getting<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.000> shift<00:03:15.330> from

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
know and just getting that shift from

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.750 
know and just getting that shift from
thinking<00:03:15.930> small<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.620> thinking<00:03:17.430> about

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
thinking small and thinking about

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.540 
thinking small and thinking about
working<00:03:18.120> for<00:03:18.740> exchanging<00:03:19.740> dollars<00:03:20.040> for<00:03:20.190> hours

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
said earlier actually something like a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.700 
said earlier actually something like a
half<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.390> million<00:03:27.600> copies<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:28.260> something<00:03:28.530> been

many people talk about the internet

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.110 
many people talk about the internet
lifestyle<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.020> they<00:05:35.110> say<00:05:35.260> things<00:05:35.320> like<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:36.120> six

weeks<00:05:37.390> later<00:05:37.480> I'm<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:37.960> millionaire<00:05:38.530> or<00:05:38.590> this

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
weeks later I'm a millionaire or this

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.280 
weeks later I'm a millionaire or this
happened<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.669> happened<00:05:39.850> so<00:05:40.330> it's<00:05:40.630> great<00:05:41.020> and

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
happened that happened so it's great and

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.110 
happened that happened so it's great and
obviously<00:05:41.650> I<00:05:41.830> think<00:05:42.340> sometimes<00:05:42.550> there's<00:05:42.940> more

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
obviously I think sometimes there's more

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.880 
obviously I think sometimes there's more
encouragement<00:05:43.510> for<00:05:43.780> people<00:05:44.110> realizing<00:05:44.800> they

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
encouragement for people realizing they

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.070 
encouragement for people realizing they
took<00:05:45.160> longer<00:05:45.460> than<00:05:45.790> a<00:05:46.000> few<00:05:46.419> weeks<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.810> get<00:05:46.930> this

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
took longer than a few weeks to get this

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.810 
took longer than a few weeks to get this
to<00:05:47.229> work<00:05:47.260> because<00:05:47.830> sometimes<00:05:48.220> it<00:05:48.370> does<00:05:48.550> take<00:05:48.790> a

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
to work because sometimes it does take a

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.480 
to work because sometimes it does take a
year<00:05:49.090> or<00:05:49.300> two<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.740> important<00:05:51.280> thing<00:05:51.310> is

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
year or two but the important thing is

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.400 
year or two but the important thing is
to<00:05:51.520> persevere<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.210> sometimes<00:05:52.870> actually<00:05:53.169> one

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
to persevere and sometimes actually one

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.510 
to persevere and sometimes actually one
very<00:05:53.620> important<00:05:53.919> distinction<00:05:54.160> I<00:05:54.280> mean<00:05:54.460> to

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
very important distinction I mean to

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.270 
very important distinction I mean to
people<00:05:54.760> is<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:55.390> having<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.930> day<00:05:56.140> job<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:56.710> still

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
people is that having a day job is still

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.650 
people is that having a day job is still
a<00:05:57.340> good<00:05:57.550> bet<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:57.910> know<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.060> mean<00:05:58.300> you<00:05:58.419> don't

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
a good bet you know I mean you don't

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.570 
a good bet you know I mean you don't
give<00:05:58.810> that<00:05:58.990> up<00:05:59.020> until<00:05:59.680> you're<00:06:00.070> ready<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.370> give

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
give that up until you're ready to give

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.219 
give that up until you're ready to give
it<00:06:00.610> up<00:06:00.820> because<00:06:00.880> it's<00:06:01.270> important<00:06:01.720> but<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:02.020> can

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
it up because it's important but I can

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.260 
it up because it's important but I can
say<00:06:02.410> that<00:06:02.440> probably<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.640> best<00:06:03.669> thing<00:06:04.000> I<00:06:04.240> ever

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
say that probably the best thing I ever
