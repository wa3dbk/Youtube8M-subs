come off the bricks this is purely for
demonstration<00:00:39.340> purposes<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:42.380> lay<00:00:42.530> your

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
demonstration purposes so you lay your

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.460 
demonstration purposes so you lay your
first<00:00:42.920> brick<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:47.210> hardest<00:00:47.690> points<00:00:48.079> here<00:00:48.290> is

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
first brick the hardest points here is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:01:02.990 
first brick the hardest points here is
always<00:00:48.829> trying<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.280> lay<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.520> second

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.550 

I<00:01:06.320> get<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> nice<00:01:07.560> big<00:01:07.830> full<00:01:08.070> curb

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
I get a nice big full curb

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.680 
I get a nice big full curb
not<00:01:10.560> too<00:01:10.800> much<00:01:10.950> mortar<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.330> end<00:01:12.540> up

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
not too much mortar so that you end up

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.910 
not too much mortar so that you end up
pushing<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.290> brick<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> wall<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
pushing the brick off the wall so you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
pushing the brick off the wall so you
support<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.550> first<00:01:20.880> brick<00:01:21.240> bring<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.050> other

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
support the first brick bring the other

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.250 
support the first brick bring the other
brick<00:01:22.440> into<00:01:23.040> place<00:01:23.720> thinking<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:25.080> your

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
brick into place thinking about your

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.920 
brick into place thinking about your
gauge<00:01:27.979> remember<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.580> edge<00:01:29.910> are<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.570> same

second line up if you wish for
demonstration<00:05:00.520> purposes<00:05:01.120> we're<00:05:01.419> showing

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
demonstration purposes we're showing

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.990 
demonstration purposes we're showing
this<00:05:02.410> would<00:05:02.650> be<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.889> final<00:05:03.160> grip<00:05:03.580> going<00:05:03.880> in

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
this would be the final grip going in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.710 
this would be the final grip going in
your<00:05:04.150> wall

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
your wall

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.090 
your wall
you<00:05:05.380> should<00:05:05.590> be<00:05:05.680> left<00:05:05.889> with<00:05:06.010> a<00:05:06.100> gap<00:05:06.370> of<00:05:06.580> 85<00:05:07.360> mil

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
you should be left with a gap of 85 mil

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.440 
you should be left with a gap of 85 mil
and<00:05:09.100> this<00:05:09.220> would<00:05:09.370> be<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.580> final<00:05:09.760> brick<00:05:10.120> going

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
and this would be the final brick going

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.659 
and this would be the final brick going
in<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.630> middle<00:05:10.930> of<00:05:10.990> your<00:05:11.110> war<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:12.550> we're

your<00:05:18.250> brick<00:05:19.470> upper<00:05:20.470> tooth<00:05:20.800> why<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.130> purpose

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
your brick upper tooth why the purpose

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:30.120 
your brick upper tooth why the purpose
will<00:05:22.000> smear<00:05:22.419> all<00:05:22.600> over<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.930> place<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.830> then

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
will smear all over the place and then

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.670 
will smear all over the place and then
gently<00:05:30.580> sliding<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.210> into<00:05:31.360> place<00:05:34.470> making<00:05:35.470> sure

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
gently sliding it into place making sure

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:45.270 
gently sliding it into place making sure
it's<00:05:35.950> even<00:05:36.490> in<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.970> gap<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.890> then<00:05:45.010> it's<00:05:45.130> not

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
it's even in the gap and then it's not

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.879 
it's even in the gap and then it's not
angled<00:05:45.880> so<00:05:46.690> either<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.900> that's<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.410> for<00:05:50.770> the

angled so either and that's a for the

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.570 
angled so either and that's a for the
