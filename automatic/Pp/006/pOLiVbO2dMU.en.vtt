00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.209
 fraudulent movement 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:12.909
 dosvidos so now you need to stop by 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.420
 hill this one here with whom we 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.420
 flew in 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.490

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.160
 Now we are driving in this way 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.160

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.890
 We put the tank haphazardly bezraznitsy 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:55.150
 put the hood as you want well, in short 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.050
 no need to direct him there now 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.030
 it's as long as you do this you will be killed 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:10.200

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.200
