and then you're just going to wrap it
around<00:01:56.580> itself<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.259> put<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.410> whole

then just go over it about two or three

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.620 
then just go over it about two or three
times<00:02:07.819> however<00:02:08.819> might<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.360> hair<00:02:09.509> will

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
times however might have your hair will

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.140 
times however might have your hair will
fit<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.160> more<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.849> ballerina

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.839 
fit so this is more like a ballerina
type<00:02:15.720> fun<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.380> still<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:17.069> still<00:02:17.670> consider

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
type fun but it's still I still consider

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.130 
type fun but it's still I still consider
this<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.360> messy<00:02:18.660> bun<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.290> still<00:02:20.690> yes<00:02:21.690> it's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
this a messy bun and it's still yes it's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.170 
this a messy bun and it's still yes it's
like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> donut<00:02:22.800> almost<00:02:23.220> so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.400 

for<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.300> next<00:02:29.570> look<00:02:29.840> you're<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.050> going<00:02:30.380> to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
for this next look you're just going to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.020 
for this next look you're just going to
kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.740> go<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> like<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.850> go

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
kind of go with it this is like the go

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.940 
kind of go with it this is like the go
with<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.360> fun<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:33.260> you're<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.440> going<00:02:33.680> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
with the fun so you're just going to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.990 
with the fun so you're just going to
pull<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.310> through<00:02:34.520> wrap<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.360> around<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:37.000> just

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
pull it through wrap it around and just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.670 
pull it through wrap it around and just
kind<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.300> keep<00:02:38.480> wrapping<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.080> around<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
kind of keep wrapping it around in the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.950 
kind of keep wrapping it around in the
same<00:02:39.860> place<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:42.710> then<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.040> gets<00:02:43.130> like<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.960> so

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
same place and then it gets like that so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.630 
same place and then it gets like that so
you<00:02:45.020> aren't<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.740> folding<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> bottom

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
you aren't really folding the bottom

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.160 
you aren't really folding the bottom
like<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.060> first<00:02:47.300> technique<00:02:47.780> you're<00:02:47.990> just

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
like in the first technique you're just

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.310 
like in the first technique you're just
trying<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.500> wrapping<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.610> around<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:51.050> same

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
trying to wrapping it around the same

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.950 
trying to wrapping it around the same
spot<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.790> could<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:53.060> fix<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.750> to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
spot and then you could just fix it to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.680 
spot and then you could just fix it to
be<00:02:54.080> bigger<00:02:54.350> if<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.860> want<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.520> then<00:02:56.390> hit<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
be bigger if you want and then hit the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.780 
be bigger if you want and then hit the
ends<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.320> my<00:02:57.380> hair<00:02:57.590> or<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.430> front<00:02:58.670> I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
ends of my hair or like in the front I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.460 
ends of my hair or like in the front I
just<00:02:58.970> kind<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.210> twist<00:02:59.450> them<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.050> back<00:03:00.200> and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
just kind of twist them to the back and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.130 
just kind of twist them to the back and
they<00:03:00.530> go<00:03:00.710> right<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.130> back<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:02.300> there<00:03:02.810> is

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
they go right to the back so there is

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.030 
they go right to the back so there is
the<00:03:03.530> last<00:03:03.800> technique<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.780> hopefully<00:03:06.500> one<00:03:07.010> of

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the last technique so hopefully one of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.000 
the last technique so hopefully one of
these<00:03:07.250> three<00:03:07.580> ways<00:03:07.790> will<00:03:08.120> help<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.630> know

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
these three ways will help you I know

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.130 
these three ways will help you I know
it's<00:03:10.010> hard<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.670> get<00:03:10.820> like<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.150> perfect<00:03:11.480> messy

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
it's hard to get like that perfect messy

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.470 
it's hard to get like that perfect messy
bun<00:03:12.380> but<00:03:13.040> you're<00:03:13.580> bound<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.940> get<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.150> with<00:03:14.330> one

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
bun but you're bound to get it with one

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.850 
bun but you're bound to get it with one
of<00:03:14.570> these<00:03:14.630> techniques<00:03:15.020> so<00:03:15.320> let<00:03:15.500> me<00:03:15.620> know<00:03:15.740> what

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
of these techniques so let me know what

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.230 
of these techniques so let me know what
you<00:03:16.130> think<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.670> I'll<00:03:16.850> see<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.180> guys<00:03:17.240> soon<00:03:17.480> bye
