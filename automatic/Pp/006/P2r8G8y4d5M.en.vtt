side<00:00:05.160> plank<00:00:05.549> using<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.450> router<00:00:07.340> it's<00:00:08.340> time<00:00:08.639> to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
side plank using a router it's time to

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.759 
side plank using a router it's time to
replace<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.420> lower<00:00:09.840> hull<00:00:10.110> side<00:00:10.349> plank<00:00:10.650> on

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
replace this lower hull side plank on

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.999 
replace this lower hull side plank on
the<00:00:10.920> starboard<00:00:11.280> side<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.590> normally<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> would

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the starboard side and normally I would

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.750 
the starboard side and normally I would
cut<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.670> fit<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.210> hand<00:00:16.340> there's<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.460> plank

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
cut and fit that by hand there's a plank

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.750 
cut and fit that by hand there's a plank
I<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.119> replaced<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:19.109> that's<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.430> dry

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
I just replaced up here that's it's dry

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.240 
I just replaced up here that's it's dry
fit<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.330> tacked<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.740> some<00:00:22.920> screws

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
fit and it's tacked in with some screws

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.560 
fit and it's tacked in with some screws
and<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.150> fit<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:24.810> hand<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:26.570> normally

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and I fit that by hand and normally

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.620 
and I fit that by hand and normally
that's<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> would<00:00:28.170> cut<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.560> fit<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.980> one

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
that's how I would cut and fit this one

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.359 
that's how I would cut and fit this one
the<00:00:30.630> reason<00:00:31.019> I'm<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> router<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the reason I'm going to use a router is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.060 
the reason I'm going to use a router is
because<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.630> existing<00:00:34.200> edge<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.920> I'm

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
because of the existing edge that I'm

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
because of the existing edge that I'm
left<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> fit<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:39.140> had<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
left with that I have to fit to I had to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
left with that I have to fit to I had to
take<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> plank<00:00:40.950> off<00:00:41.190> when<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> replace<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
take this plank off when I replace the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
take this plank off when I replace the
bottom<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> chimes<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.610> bottom

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
bottom and the chimes and now the bottom

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.200 
bottom and the chimes and now the bottom
frames<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> did<00:00:46.879> there<00:00:47.879> were<00:00:48.000> some

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
frames and what I did there were some

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.560 
frames and what I did there were some
52-hundred<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.230> between<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.910> seams<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
52-hundred in between the the seams I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
52-hundred in between the the seams I
think<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.620> had<00:00:52.739> happened<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.309> old

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
think what had happened it's an old

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
think what had happened it's an old
repair<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.510> someone<00:00:54.780> took<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.199> razor

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
repair I think someone took a razor

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.880 
repair I think someone took a razor
knife<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.230> like<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
knife you can see like right here it's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.889 
knife you can see like right here it's
kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> sharp<00:00:59.489> looks<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.359> someone<00:01:00.690> took<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
kind of sharp looks like someone took a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.070 
kind of sharp looks like someone took a
knife<00:01:01.309> when<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> plank<00:01:02.699> goes<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.120> tried<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
knife when the plank goes on tried to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
knife when the plank goes on tried to
open<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.470> seam<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> they

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
open that seam up and they and they

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.500 
open that seam up and they and they
tooled<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.430> 5200<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
tooled in some 5200 in there so when I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.399 
tooled in some 5200 in there so when I
took<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.930> plank<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.799> clean<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> up

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
took the plank off and clean this up

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.420 
took the plank off and clean this up
there's<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:14.070> some<00:01:14.220> wood

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there's you know there's some wood

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.780 
there's you know there's some wood
missing<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.439> then<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.590> front<00:01:16.920> there's<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.549> few

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
missing and then up front there's a few

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
missing and then up front there's a few
spots<00:01:18.060> where<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> varnish<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.049> chipped<00:01:19.290> on

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
spots where the varnish just chipped on

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.710 
spots where the varnish just chipped on
the<00:01:19.590> edge<00:01:19.710> well<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.909> only<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> varnish<00:01:21.540> put

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the edge well not only the varnish put

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.010 
the edge well not only the varnish put
the<00:01:21.810> wood<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> chipped<00:01:22.380> away<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.720> edge<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the wood is chipped away so this edge is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.640 
the wood is chipped away so this edge is
pretty<00:01:25.500> ragged<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.850> only<00:01:27.170> other<00:01:28.170> spots

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
pretty ragged and not only other spots

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.069 
pretty ragged and not only other spots
where<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.630> big<00:01:30.630> chunks<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
where there's you know big chunks of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.870 
where there's you know big chunks of
wood<00:01:31.259> missing<00:01:31.759> but<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> length<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
wood missing but the length of it it's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.080 
wood missing but the length of it it's
not<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.720> smooth<00:01:37.140> its<00:01:37.380> up-and-down

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
not it's not very smooth its up-and-down

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.609 
not it's not very smooth its up-and-down
so<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.210> gonna<00:01:39.360> make<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.470> more

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
so it's gonna make it a little bit more

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.940 
so it's gonna make it a little bit more
difficult<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> cut<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.579> fit<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.939> plank<00:01:42.950> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
difficult to cut and fit this plank so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.200 
difficult to cut and fit this plank so
the<00:01:44.070> reason<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.399> using<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> router<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the reason I'm using the router is I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.389 
the reason I'm using the router is I
want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.659> want<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> clean<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.649> edge<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
want to I want to clean up this edge I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.840 
want to I want to clean up this edge I
want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> make<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> edge<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:49.049> smooth<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.850> if

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
want to make this edge more smooth so if

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.289 
want to make this edge more smooth so if
you<00:01:50.970> see<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> blue<00:01:51.390> tape<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.909> I'll<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.210> it

you see the blue tape here I'll go at it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.609 
you see the blue tape here I'll go at it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
blue tape is where I want to cut to and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
blue tape is where I want to cut to and
the<00:02:02.070> blue<00:02:02.250> tape<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.729> smooth<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the blue tape of smooth it's going to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.280 
the blue tape of smooth it's going to
smooth<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.610> lot<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> dip

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
smooth out a lot of the there's a dip

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
smooth out a lot of the there's a dip
here<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.280> comes<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> point<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
here what it comes to a point and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.900 
here what it comes to a point and
there's<00:02:10.110> some<00:02:10.289> humps<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.069> then

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
there's some humps in it and then

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.080 
there's some humps in it and then
there's<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> edges<00:02:12.720> whether

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
there's the edges whether

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.770 
there's the edges whether
bad<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.830> tape<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.280> where<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.269> gonna<00:02:16.450> cut

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
bad so the tape is where I'm gonna cut

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.280 
bad so the tape is where I'm gonna cut
to<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:19.000> figured<00:02:19.360> as<00:02:19.480> long<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:19.959> going<00:02:20.140> to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
to and I figured as long as I'm going to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.160 
to and I figured as long as I'm going to
run<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.879> router<00:02:21.879> down<00:02:22.239> here<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.569> clean<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:22.959> up

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
run a router down here to clean this up

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.559 
run a router down here to clean this up
I<00:02:23.500> might<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.310> well<00:02:24.370> attack<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.970> other<00:02:25.120> plank

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
I might as well attack the other plank

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.680 
I might as well attack the other plank
on<00:02:25.810> here<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.580> router<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.879> at<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> same<00:02:28.360> time

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
on here and router that at the same time

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.500 
on here and router that at the same time
and<00:02:28.930> fit<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.849> I'm<00:02:30.940> gonna<00:02:31.060> do<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.420> I'm

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
and fit it so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.050 
and fit it so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:02:31.599> run<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> router<00:02:32.140> along<00:02:32.470> here<00:02:32.890> cut<00:02:33.879> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
gonna run the router along here cut the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.089 
gonna run the router along here cut the
very<00:02:34.299> edge<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.930> right<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.500> line<00:02:35.769> and

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
very edge of this right to that line and

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.460 
very edge of this right to that line and
then<00:02:36.610> I'm<00:02:36.730> going<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.030> cut<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.870> bottom<00:02:38.230> edge<00:02:38.349> of

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
then I'm going to cut the bottom edge of

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.300 
then I'm going to cut the bottom edge of
my<00:02:38.560> plank<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:41.080> gonna<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:42.220> gonna

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
my plank and then it's gonna it's gonna

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.160 
my plank and then it's gonna it's gonna
drop<00:02:42.610> down<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:43.239> it'll<00:02:43.360> fit<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.720> little<00:02:43.989> be

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
drop down and then it'll fit a little be

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.979 
drop down and then it'll fit a little be
a<00:02:44.200> real<00:02:44.379> nice<00:02:44.560> fit<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:46.690> what<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
a real nice fit so that's what this

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.509 
a real nice fit so that's what this
video<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.410> about<00:02:48.989> I'm<00:02:49.989> going<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.260> end<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.620> here

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
video is about I'm going to end up here

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.190 
video is about I'm going to end up here
I'll<00:02:51.640> put<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:51.970> plank<00:02:52.269> I'll<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.720> tack<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:52.959> on

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
I'll put this plank I'll just tack it on

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.089 
I'll put this plank I'll just tack it on
right<00:02:53.410> now<00:02:53.590> here's<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:55.890> here's<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> blank

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
right now here's the here's the blank

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.890 
right now here's the here's the blank
I'll<00:03:00.099> just<00:03:00.310> tack<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.760> into<00:03:01.060> place<00:03:01.299> real<00:03:01.569> quick

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.890 

it's<00:03:04.900> about<00:03:05.140> an<00:03:05.319> inch<00:03:05.470> wide<00:03:05.620> right<00:03:06.129> now

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:36.930 

I'll<00:03:14.900> lift<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.320> up<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.560> little<00:03:15.770> bit

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.699 

so<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.120> it's<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.450> little<00:03:38.480> bit<00:03:38.810> off<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.530> where

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
so it's it's a little bit off of where

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.130 
so it's it's a little bit off of where
it<00:03:39.799> should<00:03:39.860> be<00:03:40.129> but<00:03:40.430> I'm<00:03:41.299> gonna<00:03:41.540> leave<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.930> high

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
it should be but I'm gonna leave it high

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.990 
it should be but I'm gonna leave it high
like<00:03:42.409> this<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.980> I'm<00:03:43.310> going<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.519> tack<00:03:43.760> this

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
like this and I'm going to tack this

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.979 
like this and I'm going to tack this
plank<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:45.409> boat<00:03:46.150> I'm<00:03:47.150> gonna<00:03:47.569> tack<00:03:47.959> a

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
plank to the boat I'm gonna tack a

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.729 
plank to the boat I'm gonna tack a
batten<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.590> here<00:03:49.129> and<00:03:50.019> then<00:03:51.019> run<00:03:51.260> my<00:03:51.500> router

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
batten on here and then run my router

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.640 
batten on here and then run my router
through<00:03:52.129> here<00:03:52.430> cutting<00:03:53.180> both<00:03:53.360> surfaces<00:03:54.079> at<00:03:54.230> at

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
through here cutting both surfaces at at

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.869 
through here cutting both surfaces at at
once<00:03:55.360> I'll<00:03:56.360> take<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.659> few<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:57.170> passes<00:03:57.879> but

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
once I'll take a few of passes but

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.610 
once I'll take a few of passes but
that's<00:03:59.120> that's<00:03:59.720> essentially<00:04:00.140> what<00:04:00.410> I'm<00:04:00.500> gonna

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
that's that's essentially what I'm gonna

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.819 
that's that's essentially what I'm gonna
do<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.599> then<00:04:02.599> when<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.140> cut<00:04:03.410> all<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.709> way

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
do and then when when I cut all the way

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.610 
do and then when when I cut all the way
through<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.400> full<00:04:04.640> half<00:04:04.849> inch<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:06.170> will<00:04:06.410> set

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
through the full half inch this will set

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.380 
through the full half inch this will set
right<00:04:06.650> down<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.280> edge<00:04:07.459> will<00:04:07.700> be<00:04:07.730> clean<00:04:08.090> and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
right down this edge will be clean and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.130 
right down this edge will be clean and
the<00:04:08.810> plank<00:04:09.049> will<00:04:09.200> be<00:04:09.349> fed<00:04:13.599> so<00:04:14.599> that's<00:04:14.840> what<00:04:15.019> you

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
the plank will be fed so that's what you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.110 
the plank will be fed so that's what you
could<00:04:15.260> expect<00:04:15.379> to<00:04:15.650> see<00:04:15.859> in<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.010> video<00:04:16.160> I'll

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
could expect to see in the video I'll

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.259 
could expect to see in the video I'll
stop<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.539> camera<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.079> set<00:04:18.350> up<00:04:18.380> okay
