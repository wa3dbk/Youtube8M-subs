00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.149 
things but also
stuff<00:02:13.829> like<00:02:13.980> bullying<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.260> then<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.920> try<00:02:17.129> to

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
stuff like bullying and then you try to

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.000 
stuff like bullying and then you try to
improve<00:02:17.549> that<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.780> do<00:02:18.900> indicators<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.409> assess

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
improve that you do indicators to assess

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.220 
improve that you do indicators to assess
how<00:02:20.609> sustainable<00:02:21.209> your<00:02:21.359> school<00:02:21.599> actually<00:02:22.049> is

how sustainable your school actually is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.119 
how sustainable your school actually is

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
and then with those results you

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.890 
and then with those results you
implement<00:02:26.670> changes<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.299> make<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.750> more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
implement changes to make it a more

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.349

sustainable type of school so it's not

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
any asbestos or anything it's all again

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.750 
any asbestos or anything it's all again
but<00:02:40.170> oh<00:02:40.200> my<00:02:40.560> god<00:02:40.739> why<00:02:40.950> are<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.189> using<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.639> much

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
but oh my god why are we using so much

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.129 
but oh my god why are we using so much
paper<00:02:42.000> surely<00:02:42.569> we<00:02:42.659> could<00:02:42.780> do<00:02:42.870> something<00:02:43.019> about

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
paper surely we could do something about

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.080 
paper surely we could do something about
that<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.069> it's<00:02:44.219> really<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.879> take<00:02:45.060> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that so it's really just to take a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.349 
that so it's really just to take a
critical<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.439> constructive<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.220> at<00:02:47.760> how<00:02:48.299> we

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
critical but constructive like at how we

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.270 
critical but constructive like at how we
run<00:02:48.510> our<00:02:48.569> school<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.170> think<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.769> important

global warming is happening in climate

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.009 
global warming is happening in climate
change<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.549> happening<00:03:08.579> when<00:03:09.150> we're<00:03:09.329> not<00:03:09.599> doing

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
change is happening when we're not doing

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.500 
change is happening when we're not doing
anything<00:03:10.139> about<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.739> ourselves<00:03:11.180> high<00:03:12.180> schools

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
anything about it ourselves high schools

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.509 
anything about it ourselves high schools
are<00:03:12.629> places<00:03:13.079> where<00:03:13.109> students<00:03:13.769> gain<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
are places where students gain the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.729 
are places where students gain the
skills<00:03:14.669> and<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.329> knowledge<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.500> they're

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
skills and the knowledge that they're

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.960 
skills and the knowledge that they're
going<00:03:16.919> to<00:03:16.980> use<00:03:17.040> for<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> rest<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.669> their<00:03:17.790> lives

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
going to use for the rest of their lives

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.289 
going to use for the rest of their lives
and<00:03:18.449> so<00:03:19.109> if<00:03:19.379> you<00:03:19.500> teach<00:03:19.680> students<00:03:20.190> these<00:03:20.609> these

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
and so if you teach students these these

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.849 
and so if you teach students these these
basic<00:03:21.870> skills<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.379> we<00:03:22.500> are<00:03:22.620> going<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.829> need

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
basic skills that we are going to need

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.180 
basic skills that we are going to need
for<00:03:23.340> our<00:03:23.579> lives<00:03:24.419> in<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.659> future<00:03:24.859> if<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:26.040> teach

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
for our lives in the future if you teach

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250 
for our lives in the future if you teach
them<00:03:26.459> those<00:03:26.849> in<00:03:27.030> high<00:03:27.180> school<00:03:27.569> then<00:03:28.049> they'll

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
them those in high school then they'll

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.469 
them those in high school then they'll
be<00:03:28.379> set<00:03:28.560> for<00:03:28.739> life<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:29.190> lot<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.849> us<00:03:30.030> found<00:03:30.209> it

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
be set for life a lot of us found it

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.059 
be set for life a lot of us found it
really<00:03:30.659> empowering<00:03:31.169> we<00:03:31.470> found<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.769> was<00:03:31.859> a<00:03:31.889> lot

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
really empowering we found it was a lot

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.219 
really empowering we found it was a lot
easier<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.760> access<00:03:33.000> information<00:03:33.359> than<00:03:34.109> we

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
easier to access information than we

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.289 
easier to access information than we
thought<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:34.500> would<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.949> now<00:03:35.879> we<00:03:35.940> know<00:03:36.269> a

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
thought it would be and now we know a

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.180 
thought it would be and now we know a
whole<00:03:36.750> lot<00:03:36.780> more<00:03:37.229> about<00:03:37.409> how<00:03:37.739> our<00:03:37.769> school<00:03:38.159> is

our world more sustainable for teachers
and<00:03:49.859> staff<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.370> think<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.699> showed<00:03:50.940> them<00:03:51.239> that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
and staff I think it showed them that

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.240 
and staff I think it showed them that
there<00:03:52.049> are<00:03:52.169> students<00:03:52.650> who<00:03:52.829> are<00:03:53.010> really

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
there are students who are really

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.439 
there are students who are really
committed<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.669> this<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.849> are<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.269> willing

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
to put in the time and effort and it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.339
