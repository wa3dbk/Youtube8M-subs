00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.089
 in this days 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.249
 everyone seems to be an acrobat 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.239
 a gymnast a juggler 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.369
 who does balance exercises 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.889
 streets seemed impossible progress depends on balance 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.679
 not only for people but also for dams and countries 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.520
 along with the new opportunities that we sometimes take for granted 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.330
 with which we did not count 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.360
 well the responsibility to find a balance between all of them 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.510
 in bogotÃ¡ sep knows it 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.790
 That option is not limited to trucks 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.319
 It has to do with everything the trucks do 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.429
 with the measures they affect and with everything that comes in and everything that comes out of 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.080
 they 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.870
 that's why we do everything possible to find a better balance like the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.770
 balance between the essential need for global transport and that of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.130
 contribute to a cleaner environment 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.770
 the good news is that we are ahead 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.060
 As regards the protection of the environment, we occupy a position 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.230
 leader for decades 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.890
 while others barely manage to comply with stricter regulations we 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.920
 we have presented the first assembly plant in the suit carbon emissions 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.910
 of the world 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.020
 and we're just starting 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.100
 Boosting progress means finding the balance between challenges 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.810
 exceptional to those that our 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.280
 and even more exceptional solutions 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.410
 wondering 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.080
 how would the world be if what we have always seen below 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.070
 was up 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 and if what is above study in the air 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.050
 many of our biggest innovations are the smallest improvements in 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.530
 maintenance that can not be seen with the naked eye 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.480
 but they comment the benefits the performance 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.020
 Truck uptime and driver productivity 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.869
 for drivers no improvement is small 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.919
 after all a job in which security is not everything 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.759
 requires a workplace that is equally adapted in every detail 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.649
 like the lights that react to the conditions of the road 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:30.099
 windscreen wipers before the climatic conditions and a cabin what reaction 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 to the needs of the person sitting behind the wheel 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.009
 the quality trucks that attract quality drivers 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.909
 a difference that is measured in benefits and protection of the environment 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.459
 a good driver considerably reduces the consumption of 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.239
 fuel and emissions in each displacement yes so and improvement 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.090
 The environment inside the truck is one of the best ways to improve the environment 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.979
 Exterior 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:01.549
 this approach focused on creativity and safety in the 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.259
 determination and value 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:07.729
 in quality and environmental protection means that no matter what 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.400
 great challenges that we face 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.810
 and whatever the place in the world they do not serve 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.850
 what we say and what we do and what we produce is always in tune 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.499
 and not only with regard to trucks but also to complete solutions 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:25.179
 of transport all the services that our clients need 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.339
 Thus, both the training of new drivers and the transportation of 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.999
 sugarcane to a qosi biofuel production plant 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.969
 We deliver ethanol for low emission vehicles, we show that the 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:37.650
 innovation 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.909
 is not limited to pilot projects 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.579
 from hybrid trucks to financial services and new fuels 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.769
 contributes to changing economies 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.209
 and the continents 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.059
 the balance after all 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.879
 it means being always ready and prepared 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.879
 in a world in constant change 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:03.909
 the scale used in the past may not be adequate to prepare for the 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.599
 future 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.419
 so look forward 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.519
 it has never been something strange an option for us is a necessary baggage 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.459
 growing world 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.459
 meet the demands of 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.939
 achieve balance 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:27.029
 it is an important task that we must all undertake 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.629
 nobody has the responsibility to face only a challenge 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.879
 but nobody is free from the obligation to assume their part 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.460
 this is what we are doing 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.830
 it is a 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 of a dealer or a business card 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.539
 whether the larger truck appears 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.509
 with the smallest spare part 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.080
 there where vial name volvo thorax 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.009
 will be seeing a solution 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.250
 that drive progress
