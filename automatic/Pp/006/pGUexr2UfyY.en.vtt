the<00:00:30.179> reason<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.720> only<00:00:30.810> grow<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> couple<00:00:31.380> of

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the reason is they only grow a couple of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
the reason is they only grow a couple of
feet<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.980> don't<00:00:32.189> need<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> huge<00:00:32.790> amount<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
feet you don't need a huge amount of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.420 
feet you don't need a huge amount of
compost<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> fertilizer<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:35.100> thee<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
compost and fertilizer to thee and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.299 
compost and fertilizer to thee and
they're<00:00:35.790> super<00:00:36.090> prolific<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:37.950> only<00:00:38.040> grow

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
they're super prolific so they only grow

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.479 
they're super prolific so they only grow
you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.059> yo<00:00:39.750> hi<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.129> seen<00:00:41.370> them

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you know like yo hi and I have seen them

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.670 
you know like yo hi and I have seen them
grow<00:00:41.640> before<00:00:41.969> I've<00:00:42.300> seen<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.899> videos<00:00:43.260> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
grow before I've seen other videos and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
grow before I've seen other videos and
the<00:00:43.739> different<00:00:44.129> nurseries<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.760> stuff<00:00:44.940> but

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the different nurseries and stuff but

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.549 
the different nurseries and stuff but
I've<00:00:45.180> never<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.570> grown<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> myself<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
I've never actually grown to myself I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
I've never actually grown to myself I
was<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.039> large<00:00:47.280> cherry<00:00:47.730> tomato<00:00:48.090> that's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
was going to large cherry tomato that's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.209 
was going to large cherry tomato that's
quite<00:00:49.110> probably<00:00:49.379> thinking<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.950> pick<00:00:50.190> from

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
quite probably thinking I can pick from

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.910 
quite probably thinking I can pick from
them<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> time<00:00:51.120> now<00:00:51.780> my<00:00:51.989> concern<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.500> with

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
them all the time now my concern is with

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.790 
them all the time now my concern is with
this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.820> they<00:00:54.059> may<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.600> produce<00:00:54.800> fruit

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this is that they may just produce fruit

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
this is that they may just produce fruit
and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.280> die<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.789> you've<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> keep<00:00:57.570> them

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and then die and you've got to keep them

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.170 
and then die and you've got to keep them
ongoing<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.440> might<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> good<00:00:59.699> idea<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.090> have

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
ongoing so might be a good idea to have

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
ongoing so might be a good idea to have
one<00:01:00.239> nice<00:01:00.750> big<00:01:01.020> cherry<00:01:01.289> tomato<00:01:01.620> plant<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
one nice big cherry tomato plant and a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119 
one nice big cherry tomato plant and a
few<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.180> save<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> water<00:01:04.129> bit

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
few of these to save a bit of water bit

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.679 
few of these to save a bit of water bit
of<00:01:05.250> space<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.790> compost<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.390> things<00:01:06.570> like

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of space and compost and things like

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.710 
of space and compost and things like
that<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.570> moving<00:01:09.570> into

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720

soil gear to make my own soil mix my own
potting<00:02:04.040> mix<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:05.180> put<00:02:05.360> about<00:02:05.450> 25<00:02:06.200> ended<00:02:06.590> up

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
potting mix and I put about 25 ended up

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.229 
potting mix and I put about 25 ended up
mixing<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.159> bit<00:02:07.310> more<00:02:07.490> potting<00:02:07.850> mix<00:02:08.030> over

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
mixing in a bit more potting mix over

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.920 
mixing in a bit more potting mix over
about<00:02:08.420> 25<00:02:08.840> percent<00:02:09.380> worm<00:02:09.560> castings<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.369> here

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
about 25 percent worm castings in here

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.050 
about 25 percent worm castings in here
about<00:02:11.930> 25<00:02:12.500> percent<00:02:12.890> compost<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.670> then<00:02:13.760> about

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
about 25 percent compost and then about

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.559 
about 25 percent compost and then about
50<00:02:14.630> percent<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.310> Searls<00:02:16.910> potting<00:02:17.390> mix

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
50 percent is the Searls potting mix

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.610 
50 percent is the Searls potting mix
that<00:02:17.810> I'm<00:02:17.930> using<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:20.150> know<00:02:20.620> I've

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that I'm using and you know I've

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.110 
that I'm using and you know I've
probably<00:02:21.800> couldn't<00:02:22.280> mix<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.610> bit<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.760> button

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
probably couldn't mix in a bit of button

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.610 
probably couldn't mix in a bit of button
bottom<00:02:23.269> as<00:02:23.540> well<00:02:23.690> but<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.900> might<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.110> sprinkle

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
bottom as well but I might just sprinkle

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.890 
bottom as well but I might just sprinkle
that<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.800> top<00:02:25.120> looks<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.239> what<00:02:26.480> put<00:02:26.750> that

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
that on top looks like what put that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.930 
that on top looks like what put that
into<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.530> mix<00:02:27.890> here<00:02:27.980> which<00:02:28.370> helped<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:28.849> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
into this mix here which helped with the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.789 
into this mix here which helped with the
flowering<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:30.080> I've<00:02:30.200> got<00:02:30.350> something<00:02:30.590> else

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
flowering but I've got something else

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.440 
flowering but I've got something else
that<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.310> show<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.970> will<00:02:32.150> help<00:02:32.180> with

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
that I can show you that will help with

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.960 
that I can show you that will help with
the<00:02:32.569> flowering<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.430> what<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.940> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the flowering and this is what I like to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780 
the flowering and this is what I like to
use<00:02:35.769> we<00:02:36.769> use<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:37.190> Yates

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
use we use a Yates

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490 
use we use a Yates
it's<00:02:37.940> an<00:02:38.090> uplift<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.720> some<00:02:39.170> mixture<00:02:39.440> of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
it's an uplift and some mixture of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.100 
it's an uplift and some mixture of
seaweed<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.280> fish<00:02:40.370> emulsion<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.959> will

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
seaweed and fish emulsion and that will

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.740 
seaweed and fish emulsion and that will
help<00:02:42.230> with<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.530> flowering<00:02:42.950> fruit<00:02:43.250> set<00:02:43.519> now<00:02:44.420> when

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
help with a flowering fruit set now when

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.750 
help with a flowering fruit set now when
I'm<00:02:44.900> actually<00:02:45.200> doing<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.830> transplanting<00:02:46.580> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
I'm actually doing the transplanting I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.650 
I'm actually doing the transplanting I
use<00:02:47.330> sea<00:02:48.019> salt<00:02:48.049> yeah<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.280> that's<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.299> liquid

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
use sea salt yeah and that's just liquid

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.110 
use sea salt yeah and that's just liquid
seaweed<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.680> use<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.010> twice<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
seaweed and I use that twice the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.580 
seaweed and I use that twice the
strength<00:02:53.390> what<00:02:53.660> they<00:02:53.780> recommend<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:54.440> I'm

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
strength what they recommend but I'm

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.820 
strength what they recommend but I'm
doing<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.860> transplanting<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:56.440> slow<00:02:57.440> down<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
doing the transplanting to slow down the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.979 
doing the transplanting to slow down the
roots<00:02:58.040> shot<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.940> I've<00:02:59.150> got<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.420> mixed<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.720> here

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
roots shot and I've got it mixed up here

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.050 
roots shot and I've got it mixed up here
in<00:03:00.049> my<00:03:00.200> dirty<00:03:00.620> container<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:01.579> was<00:03:01.730> doing

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
in my dirty container that I was doing

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.330 
in my dirty container that I was doing
all<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.570> mix<00:03:02.810> or<00:03:02.989> paddle<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.530> loans<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:03.950> before

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
all the mix or paddle to loans in before

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.520 
all the mix or paddle to loans in before
and<00:03:04.700> I'm<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.570> going<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.900> water<00:03:06.109> them<00:03:06.320> in<00:03:06.350> a

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
and I'm just going to water them in a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.900 
and I'm just going to water them in a
little<00:03:06.950> bit<00:03:07.420> now<00:03:08.420> through<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.870> tray<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.760> know

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
little bit now through the tray you know

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.720 
little bit now through the tray you know
the<00:03:14.450> roots<00:03:14.660> amount<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.109> small<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:15.859> so<00:03:16.609> you

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
the roots amount is small but so you

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.190 
the roots amount is small but so you
don't<00:03:16.940> need<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.150> lot<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.600> boys<00:03:17.720> going<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> waste

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
don't need a lot of boys going to waste

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.360 
don't need a lot of boys going to waste
it<00:03:18.470> because<00:03:18.560> you're<00:03:18.769> just<00:03:18.859> going<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.100> put<00:03:19.250> all

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
it because you're just going to put all

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.360 
it because you're just going to put all
this<00:03:20.049> seaweed<00:03:21.049> through<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.530> mix<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.160> it's

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
this seaweed through the mix and it's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.319 
this seaweed through the mix and it's
just<00:03:22.489> going<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.670> dry<00:03:22.850> out<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.209> you're

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
just going to dry out so you're

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.699 
just going to dry out so you're
underneath<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.660> little<00:03:23.900> bit<00:03:24.079> that's<00:03:24.319> why<00:03:24.500> it's

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
underneath a little bit that's why it's

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.530 
underneath a little bit that's why it's
mixed<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.100> up<00:03:25.190> in<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:25.459> container<00:03:25.850> there<00:03:26.180> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
mixed it up in that container there and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.270 
mixed it up in that container there and
then<00:03:27.109> you<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.380> like<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.769> hope<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:28.069> got<00:03:28.160> my

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
then you know like I hope it's got my

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.949 
then you know like I hope it's got my
little<00:03:28.400> trusted<00:03:28.850> spray<00:03:29.120> bottle<00:03:29.480> gear<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:29.810> I'm

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
little trusted spray bottle gear now I'm

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.300 
little trusted spray bottle gear now I'm
always<00:03:30.139> using<00:03:30.590> water

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
always using water

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.640 
always using water
it's<00:03:31.579> dechlorinated<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:33.109> I'm<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.500> going<00:03:33.620> to

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
it's dechlorinated and I'm just going to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.970 
it's dechlorinated and I'm just going to
give<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:33.950> bit<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.220> spray<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:36.530> some<00:03:36.739> over

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
give it a bit of a spray just some over

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
give it a bit of a spray just some over
there<00:03:37.160> flow<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.639> down<00:03:37.790> any<00:03:38.420> type<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.750> stress

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
there flow it down any type of stress

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.410 
there flow it down any type of stress
levels<00:03:39.769> at<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:40.310> now<00:03:41.440> these<00:03:42.440> could<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:44.060> theory

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
levels at all now these could in theory

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.410 
levels at all now these could in theory
grow<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.319> these<00:03:45.560> pots<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.250> produce<00:03:46.940> fruit<00:03:47.209> and

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
grow in these pots and produce fruit and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.150 
grow in these pots and produce fruit and
actually<00:03:47.780> will<00:03:48.049> grow<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.590> size<00:03:48.859> pot

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
actually will grow in this size pot

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.670 
actually will grow in this size pot
which<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:49.700> about<00:03:50.000> 25<00:03:50.540> centimeters<00:03:51.200> high<00:03:51.350> sits

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
which is about 25 centimeters high sits

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.740 
which is about 25 centimeters high sits
two<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> half<00:03:52.100> centimeters<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.790> an<00:03:52.880> inch<00:03:53.030> so

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
two and a half centimeters to an inch so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.840 
two and a half centimeters to an inch so
you<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:54.109> your<00:03:54.260> math<00:03:54.410> for<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.889> and<00:03:55.190> it's<00:03:55.730> about

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
you do your math for that and it's about

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.479 
you do your math for that and it's about
well<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.359> can<00:03:56.600> put<00:03:56.720> my<00:03:56.870> hand<00:03:57.049> right<00:03:57.170> across<00:03:57.489> to

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
well I can put my hand right across to

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.920 
well I can put my hand right across to
the<00:03:58.700> other<00:03:58.790> side<00:03:59.090> there<00:03:59.329> so<00:03:59.359> it's<00:03:59.540> about<00:03:59.750> 20

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
the other side there so it's about 20

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.590 
the other side there so it's about 20
centimetres<00:04:00.769> across<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.970> I'm<00:04:02.450> making

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
centimetres across there and I'm making

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.130 
centimetres across there and I'm making
a<00:04:02.840> beautiful<00:04:03.319> mess<00:04:03.470> on<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.799> floor

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
a beautiful mess on the floor

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.350 
a beautiful mess on the floor
to<00:04:04.800> clean<00:04:05.040> up<00:04:05.250> now<00:04:06.770> this<00:04:07.770> guy<00:04:08.010> he<00:04:09.000> probably

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
to clean up now this guy he probably

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.780 
to clean up now this guy he probably
will<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.810> fruit<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.770> him<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.040> about<00:04:11.310> six

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
will have fruit and on him in about six

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430 
will have fruit and on him in about six
weeks<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.480> know<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.750> Pig<00:04:13.050> watching<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
weeks but you know you Pig watching the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.320 
weeks but you know you Pig watching the
show<00:04:13.650> because<00:04:14.040> what<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:14.670> want<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:14.910> doing<00:04:15.240> is

watch how they grow

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.740 
watch how they grow
I'm<00:04:17.160> how<00:04:17.400> they're<00:04:17.609> producing<00:04:18.239> how<00:04:18.540> they're

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
I'm how they're producing how they're

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.840 
I'm how they're producing how they're
flowering<00:04:19.620> how<00:04:19.950> much<00:04:20.190> fruit<00:04:20.459> we're<00:04:20.669> going<00:04:20.790> to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
flowering how much fruit we're going to

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.550 
flowering how much fruit we're going to
get<00:04:21.000> off<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.150> them<00:04:21.390> how<00:04:21.600> much<00:04:21.720> Sun<00:04:22.109> we're

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
get off of them how much Sun we're

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.980 
get off of them how much Sun we're
giving<00:04:22.919> them<00:04:23.210> what's<00:04:24.210> really<00:04:24.390> going<00:04:24.810> on<00:04:24.930> with

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
giving them what's really going on with

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.710 
giving them what's really going on with
these<00:04:25.200> guys<00:04:25.470> because<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.010> believe<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.720> it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
these guys because I believe that it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.650 
these guys because I believe that it
could<00:04:28.050> be<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.440> part<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.550> solution<00:04:29.970> for<00:04:30.540> small

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
could be a part of a solution for small

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.900 
could be a part of a solution for small
space<00:04:31.110> gardening<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:32.280> really<00:04:32.640> only<00:04:32.790> need

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
space gardening is we really only need

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.630 
space gardening is we really only need
so<00:04:33.810> much<00:04:34.020> food<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.680> we<00:04:34.800> not<00:04:35.070> only<00:04:35.100> need<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.430> put

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
so much food and we not only need to put

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.880 
so much food and we not only need to put
out<00:04:35.790> so<00:04:36.000> much<00:04:36.180> energy<00:04:36.660> input<00:04:36.990> now<00:04:37.410> we're

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
out so much energy input now we're

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.650 
out so much energy input now we're
paying<00:04:38.130> for<00:04:38.430> water<00:04:38.640> here<00:04:38.970> in<00:04:39.060> Australia<00:04:39.600> and

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
paying for water here in Australia and

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.880 
paying for water here in Australia and
probably<00:04:40.110> all<00:04:40.200> over<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.500> world<00:04:40.710> you're

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
probably all over the world you're

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.560 
probably all over the world you're
paying<00:04:41.070> for<00:04:41.220> water<00:04:41.340> you've<00:04:41.910> got<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.150> pay<00:04:42.300> for

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
paying for water you've got to pay for

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.550 
paying for water you've got to pay for
potting<00:04:42.870> mix<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.200> go<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.350> pay<00:04:43.530> for

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
potting mix you go to pay for

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.440 
potting mix you go to pay for
fertilizers<00:04:44.400> all<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.700> type<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:44.940> stuff<00:04:45.210> and

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
fertilizers all that type of stuff and

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.240 
fertilizers all that type of stuff and
then<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.020> day<00:04:46.169> you<00:04:46.230> just<00:04:46.560> want<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:46.980> food

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
then the day you just want to have food

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.190 
then the day you just want to have food
that<00:04:47.310> comes<00:04:47.640> out<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.090> goes<00:04:48.240> on<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.630> table<00:04:49.080> and

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
that comes out and goes on the table and

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.960 
that comes out and goes on the table and
into<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.680> know<00:04:49.800> your<00:04:50.040> salad<00:04:50.430> sandwiches

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
into the you know your salad sandwiches

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.360 
into the you know your salad sandwiches
however<00:04:51.720> what<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.140> want<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.380> do<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> bit<00:04:52.830> so

however what you want to do a bit so
that's<00:04:53.669> what<00:04:53.940> I'm<00:04:54.090> trying<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.419> do<00:04:54.570> here<00:04:54.840> is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
that's what I'm trying to do here is

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.230 
that's what I'm trying to do here is
just<00:04:55.290> work<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:55.800> lowering<00:04:56.430> down<00:04:56.730> and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
just work on just lowering down and

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.659 
just work on just lowering down and
cutting<00:04:57.960> down<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.440> energy<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.370> cost

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
cutting down the energy and the cost

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.310 
cutting down the energy and the cost
that<00:04:59.940> I'm<00:05:00.060> using<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.540> produce<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.140> same

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
that I'm using to produce the same

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.460 
that I'm using to produce the same
amount<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.740> foods<00:05:02.010> that<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.210> consume<00:05:03.900> at<00:05:04.200> home

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
amount of foods that I consume at home

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.380 
amount of foods that I consume at home
and<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.220> know<00:05:05.340> we've<00:05:05.520> got<00:05:05.550> food<00:05:05.940> coming<00:05:05.970> up

actually get from what I've seen before

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.390 
actually get from what I've seen before
they<00:05:25.350> get<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.530> bit<00:05:25.740> bigger<00:05:25.919> than<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.130> large

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400

cherry tomato and be interesting to see

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.670 
cherry tomato and be interesting to see
if<00:05:29.460> they<00:05:29.640> go<00:05:29.910> determine<00:05:30.810> an<00:05:30.930> indeterminate<00:05:31.530> so

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
if they go determine an indeterminate so

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.740 
if they go determine an indeterminate so
how<00:05:31.830> long<00:05:31.979> they<00:05:32.160> grow<00:05:32.400> through<00:05:32.479> once<00:05:33.479> they<00:05:33.630> get

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
how long they grow through once they get

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.390 
how long they grow through once they get
to<00:05:33.900> an<00:05:34.020> end<00:05:34.169> crop<00:05:34.530> will<00:05:34.830> they<00:05:34.919> keep<00:05:35.160> producing

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
to an end crop will they keep producing

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.810

it but we're still not sure because we

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.880 
it but we're still not sure because we
really<00:05:41.760> grow<00:05:42.030> them<00:05:42.270> ourselves<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.560> find

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
really grow them ourselves and to find
