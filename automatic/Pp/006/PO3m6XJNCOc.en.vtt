00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 it was a very good blog it was my favorite in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 question of downloading music the truth 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.579
 I loved it but the page was updated 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 and the truth was updated in a way 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.960
 very great but in itself it is still like 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789
 the same way of downloading many 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.909
 people told me they did not know 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 how to download music from this page is 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.430
 say no 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.229
 they did not find the wave even though 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.460
 on the page I explained it good for 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 all those who have not yet understood 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 how it works so I'm going to teach you in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.040
 this video how the page works 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 I'm going to leave the page in the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.940
 description along with this video of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 recommendation that I made I have changed 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.470
 the links on this page already change the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990
 link of the blog by the link that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 now that is this I pass it to the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.770
 girl so many thanks is a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 beautiful girl follow her on twitter I 'm 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.830
 talking to her on twitter so 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.600
 they follow lentini in their social networks 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.009
 to know her 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 but I'll show you the page 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.850
 then it's a great page to me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 love you can download both 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.680
 discographies as softwares as 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.830
 short software soundtrack and what's wrong with me 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.899
 my god good as are tracks and here 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.240
 you can download the complete ones and if you 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.160
 you're a fan of an artist I do not know 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.600
 josh on beaver let's say if you are 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.430
 fan of them without living you can find 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.409
 from his first album to his most 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.999
 recent including the ap 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.200
 live the acoustic live 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:10.119
 absolutely all find here and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.220
 that's something that I love on the page 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.470
 and it is super well accommodated the best is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.629
 that mega downloads do not need your 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.030
 tower does not exist is another strange program 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.830
 to everything you are super super mega great as well 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.230
 that we're going to start worth the page is 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.269
 so here appears the beginning that is the most 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.160
 recent that has risen appears the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.319
 discography that only you can find your 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.950
 favorite artist and the same are trans and 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.290
 the doubts 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.840
 good in discography if you have 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.660
 a favorite band search here for the name 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.480
 of the band make up their initial letter and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.700
 on soundtrack it 's exactly the same 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.769
 look for the name of the movie either 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.569
 in English or in Spanish if you do not 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.220
 find in Spanish search in English 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.230
 know that sometimes there are like those changes 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.000
 such rare landmarks where you arrive 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.040
 here for example advantages of being 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.590
 Invisible judge him because cloud 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.079
 start with advantages something like that an example 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.910
 aladdin with one and all that kind of 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.980
 like movies in discography if you have 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.190
 you're looking for a favorite artist 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.170
 with your initial we will start them 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.180
 for example what band I like I like 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.890
 and then start with pe and the best is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.170
 that you can open multiple tabs to the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.030
 time is great here we are going to put 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.800
 find your artist's name appears 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.340
 In this way, this dad daddy carries his daddy 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.500
 Daddy seriously there I did not know it's great 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.270
 then they are going to look for you here for example 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.190
 here is for love the group that I 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.470
 I want you to give a click you are going to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.600
 open another window and it's going to 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.050
 appear as I told them the discography their 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.480
 first album second album third album 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.430
 fourth album then once they have 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 this is going to download what you 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.560
 want up here below it appears is 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.630
 the password is this they are going to copy the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.000
 password that marks them and right click 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.830
 copy and they will keep copying it worth 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.450
 if they have some link already useless already 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.700
 you know here I know that they leave here a 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.390
 comment that the links do not work or 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.590
 something like that and we're going to look for 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.799
 example the disk that you want 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.060
 download in my case I will download the 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.340
 I really have it but we are going to 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.190
 download this will open another 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.540
 window in this way I know that some 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.630
 they will think and I need 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.310
 it is very easy for many people who do not 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.019
 you know then let's teach them 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.019
 present you already know 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.610
 it's true but respect those who 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.440
 they do not learn very well how it works 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.690
 this because it's a little bit more complicated 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.550
 of what seems worth you already know that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.190
 downloading music online comes 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.810
 being illegal and this has to have a 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.120
 greater security therefore the girls 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.150
 other modifications in the rap so that 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.949
 do not get the copyright just want 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.750
 close or either the page or 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.400
 delete the files once 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.650
 appear in mega they will click on 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.449
 download to your computer they will wait for 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.400
 that time passes and that the 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.410
 download let's wait for a moment like 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.080
 you see the download is finished here 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.370
 appears the file has been downloaded 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.560
 I will completely give you a right click 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.479
 in show in folder and it will take me to 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.009
 where have the downloads as you see them 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.960
 is going to look like this file that is a 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.090
 unknown file will mark your 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.610
 computer but not when they 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.259
 appear this to be able to download all 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.389
 the files that come inside are going to 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.430
 give right click change name and in 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.360
 they change their name until the end they will 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.780
 put 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.639
 It's worth when I'm sure that 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.430
 they have written point rar they will give 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.919
 enter and automatically the file goes 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.830
 to convert into a rar point in a winrar 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.169
 you are going to give right click extract in and 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.180
 they will put the name that appears 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.310
 there when you give him right click 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.020
 to extract here they will appear this 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.090
 option to enter the password and 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.949
 they are going to paste the password that says in the 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.259
 bottom part that we copied at the beginning 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.939
 you will accept eyes not all 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.340
 passwords are the same if there are some 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:54.169
 passwords that are different for another 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.599
 kind of files good to wait for 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.750
 I ended up downloading all the songs and 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.819
 when they enter your folder here this 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.069
 it's going to look like this and it's going 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.020
 appear all the songs here 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.490
 ok is all all the songs of the 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.090
 album are going to do exactly the same 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.710
 with all the artists and the 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.960
 discographies that appear in this 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.300
 page is easy although some people 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.099
 they worried when the 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300
 unknown file and they could not 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.919
 activate it to the rar 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.020
 good as you see is super super mega 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.180
 simple if you have a problem with that 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.050
 comment to the girl and tell her you know that 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.930
 the file does not 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.520
 because of this the link is broken bla bla this 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.889
 he does it to avoid copyright me 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.889
 I imagine the truth I do not know maybe it's 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.449
 an invocation to the Russian mafia either 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.740

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.289
