that approach if you do diagnose it what

has to be done well typically the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.540 
has to be done well typically the
diagnosis<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.480> thought<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.980> simple

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.630 
physical exam confirmatory studies
typically<00:01:02.640> involve<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.149> ultrasound<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.430> what

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
typically involve an ultrasound and what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.020 
typically involve an ultrasound and what
will<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.360> find<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.909> if<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
will they do if they do find it if a

it<00:01:10.710> should<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> removed<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:12.060> excision

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
it should be removed but excision

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
it should be removed but excision
involves<00:01:13.049> taking<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> cysts

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
involves taking out not just the cysts

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.300 
involves taking out not just the cysts
but<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> remaining<00:01:15.780> tract<00:01:16.259> extending<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.070> to
