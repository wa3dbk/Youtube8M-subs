00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.120
 greetings to that work and point today we are going 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.400
 to prepare a pattern to do the part 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.710
 from below the bikini for that we're going to 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.710
 need some panties that come to us 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.169
 well paper that's where we're going to do the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.000
 pattern this is a finite paper but 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.950
 We can use any paper that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.520
 we have at hand either paper of 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.180
 newspaper or a carton we will need 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.650
 also a pencil or something to mark 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.250
 pins and scissors 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.620
 I have the long sheet of paper and what 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.219
 I do is fold it in half 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 leaving the crease part here and the 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.870
 part open in front of me 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.489
 so you can see what I mean 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.530
 I have taken a folio and what I do is this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.530
 fold it in half 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.760
 and leave this part that is bent 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.550
 out and the open part leave it 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.060
 inwards is the same as what I've done 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.750
 with this big paper the paper has to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.980
 be long enough so that 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 fit the panties in this way 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.830
 Well, this is how we have to give him the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.740
 return and we have to fit whole 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.220
 then we take the panties 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.860
 booths it is advisable to take ones that do not 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.740
 have a lot of function around here so 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.150
 we can put them better we have to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.150
 fold them this way 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:02.369
 we put one part with another and we're going 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.369
 joining the central part of the leg 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.920
 once we have this part of here united 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.239
 and rounded we're going to put 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.459
 this part that is double the gravita 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.410
 with the double we have done in the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.900
 paper we have to put it on one extreme 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.270
 since then we have to give the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.400
 back in this way 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.400
 and it has to fit us along 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.830
 once we have put half of the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.830
 panty we are going to mark 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.540
 and above all the most important thing is this 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.540
 the part of inside the leg 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.909
 once we have this part marked 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.909
 we remove these pins 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.940
 and we are going around 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.310
 once we have the outlined outline 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.310
 we take the panties 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.330
 we remove the pins 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.949
 we fold it in half 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:58.389
 we put it on the edge and we mark a 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.389
 straight line 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.030
 and we do the same with the other side 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.030
 we have calculated the central part 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.800
 this is the front part of the 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:28.919
 panties and this is the part behind 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.340
 actually the important thing about this pattern 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.980
 is the part of the leg this part of 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:39.020
 here 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:42.200
 and this part of here is here is the 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.780
 part that is hooked to the hip is 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.260
 we can make it wider or more 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.639
 narrow and from here we can upload it or 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.990
 more or less 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:56.810
 the important thing I already say is this 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.450
 once the pattern is taken what we have 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.930
 what to do is cut it down the line 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:05.390
 where we have marked once cut what 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.200
 we open and we already have the pattern of 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.200
 our work ready 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.250
 with the pattern what we are going to do is 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.250
 center the 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:26.500
 and put some pins here 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.500
 and here 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:48.679
 once this is done and we have done the 

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:50.569
 pattern I hope you liked it if it's 

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:53.949

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:53.949
