 in Castilla-La Mancha every time we will have bottled milk but also 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.059
 we produce a lot and that is why there is wine in bulk but they have asked for

 what do we prefer to buy like this other countries 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.960
 the company that is 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.009
 because it seems 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.119
 japan is 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.289
 big brother know him 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.609
 Russia is easier to transport 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 bulk merchandise 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.870
 has other bottled carriers that more volume carries more weight in the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.079
 lillo colo colo video is the most economical in the country of destination 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.740
 Armed winery dedicated to socuÃ©llamos are devoted largely to selling wine 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.760
 in this way 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.730
 but inside the bulk in many types of wines 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.340
 of a video totally in branch that indicates that that sense that is without 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.970
 without filtering without any treatment 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.410
 photo of argentine lionel messi 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.460
 perfectly finished this time to a cold 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.249
 corrected from your future your products 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.270
 perfect to get directly from london 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.520
 because imagine what is the same japan as an Englishman and a German 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.600
 this zone 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.160
 per hundred and it's not all but everyone 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.230
 a consumer end say that for some customs 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.990
 in terms of use because not every day is used for the same 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 bottling make baxter vinegar food are some examples we're already 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.830
 present the vice president the winery because 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.610
 this one-hour term 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.460
 just like all collections 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.010
 aware 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.400
 many say that there 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.300
 according to the oiea offered t 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.490
 You say you have plenty of stress, I always thought that this entity 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.740
 belonging to spare 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.480
 but then at the end 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.820
 everything is sold 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.520
 medina is not pulled 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 in the years that I have it is very seen never 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.420
 He specified that the consensus be administered by Kathy Calvin 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.640
 the sale are divided of wine that can be saved together we can leave discarded 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.150
 that freshness they filled will disappear or popes in history after 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.470
 to regret 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.350
 I do not think so 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.399
 Conversely 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.970
 Reduced cycle aspect 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.150
 labor 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.450
 5 is very difficult the virgin cooperative of the vineyards of Tomelloso is also 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.619
 a large bulk exporter 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.159
 in this museum is where we could see a little the representation of the origin or 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:15.809
 from where 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:19.239
 the extraordinary session where his actions 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.899
 from here and that the providers offered by the socialists and grape growers 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.969
 in their houses their caves 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.689
 Ajax chacin 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.879
 all the marketing that this can do 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.059
 it was fascinating to us that we are the biggest offensive in Europe 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.959
 the negotiated volume that we have with our grape sales agency 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.359
 about 3 percent 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.100
 the actors come out well and motivated 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.519
 and the return 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.950
 let's make a lot of wine because your faith consigns mexico with 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.389
 2004 is exporting 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.449
 they were 136 million kilos of grapes 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.619
 is a pass in Florida with a daily entry more and more than 8 million 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.219
 this is the best little 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.599
 Michael 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.909
 it was mainly country estimated in its volume 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.090
 for example russia and china are countries that are male sets 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.539
 countries and indeed from bulk 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:17.999
 France and Italy 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.099
 also European country sub 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 Leonel is because after they 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.749
 we have always had a relationship with the gib and now he 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.989
 this soccer concept 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.129
 the bulk wine of yours is the 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.579
 a great quality by tyc 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 tactically much of the 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.109
 happens that that child leaves to get directly into the bottle so more 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.539
 they have the quality that this wine has to have but with our climate and 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.629
 extensions this we have already won
