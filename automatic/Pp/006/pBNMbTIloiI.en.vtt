00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.049
 video of me I thought I'll do it 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.820
 quite apt to the topic summer one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.490
 top 5 and was my favorite 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.320
 summer shoes it is almost limited 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 Only on sandals are it 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.850
 actually only the shoes that i have 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 last few weeks we were in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.539
 germany first correct and legitimate 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.740
 could call summer but this time must 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.300
 I say that from the german summer 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.670
 Actually quite pleased because he did 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 was very very warm with me you go 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 could wear and I 'm just on 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.320
 with a few sandals they are black 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.809
 I stop so much but five 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 individually from the house are from hello 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.390
 that is many brand the nicole richie 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.190
 design or enveloped and I do not know 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 how strong is that in this process 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 involved here, I there was 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.289
 already one and a half two years approximately 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.170
 and they have almost come to terms here 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.699
 The house on hair logo, however, is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 That's not so well known and therefore 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.149
 The sequins are so striking 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 occupied and above all are pretty 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.040
 comfortable I can not do any 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.560
 toe sandals so this flip flops 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.700
 They almost wear the stands between the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.229
 have teeth because it's easy for me 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 Hurts unbelievably 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.170
 I really do not belong to the group 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 a few people do not do that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 So yes, you can not wear it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 like and also fun that means they fit 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.770
 In any case, first to everything 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.770
 somehow maybe it's black too 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.700
 or what hardware first 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.130
 independently 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 ask you where did he go always to the topic 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.479
 all these cut so these are the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.130
 actually very dark silver but also 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 Almost black cut so no 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.610
 really prominent scrolling or silver 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.789
 that is, they can actually 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.220
 all then put my unbeaten 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.810
 favorites are my active ingredients in white 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.549
 as far as paint leather and is not leather 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 made of plastic but the black 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.329
 veil and theme I just have 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 scary like you are comfortable i like you 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.200
 not a house as a slipper 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.649
 but at least as often as well 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.450
 actually out there then just shoes 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.579
 which I already have other videos 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.110
 our fortune has shown that in the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.549
 Sandals yes a metallic 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 historical on it have such a finish 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.239
 that is not true 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.650
 Silver is almost a bit where you are 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.880
 but did not really want that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.400
 Fink rose gold and the naked we have 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 already some walkers that me 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.959
 as you can see and are not quite 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.790
 fresh but also very very comfortable 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.650
 still a great skier 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.050
 honestly, you can see that too 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.030
 a little bit that she already 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.890
 a little closer the poland is already one 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.700
 or have another season behind you and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.220
 Although are of the brand I believe one 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.380
 exactly I ordered better who 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.120
 Here also a rose gold bridge 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 and here's another golden one 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.890
 metallic element and then one 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.930
 not real pony fell here but in such 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.070
 a share in front of optics and there it is 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.320
 here are so many different elements 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.540
 but they still fit almost too 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.460
 all because of this material consciously there 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.920
 then somehow gives in all 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.440
 Finds a bit and for the first time 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.390
 whatever I wear today 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.830
 But now I'm only for others 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.350
 types of stocks decided also 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.210
 but otherwise he is with me 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.670
 my most comfortable and dear sander 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.920
 one then I own I have a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.040
 another couple and that way now 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.310
 none are different 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.470
 mustard yellow shoes but not so 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.060
 men's shoes but you can 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 actually still a little bit further 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.990
 graduate quite a bit 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.450
 that brings you also a blogpost in 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.670
 the infobox where you have the shoes once before 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.340
 in action can see they have too 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.750
 to the golden applications below and me 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.130
 I really like the color 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.650
 really nice and was with 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.470
 my red hair and yes they are 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.959
 full of his brands are in spain 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.430
 and they really want to 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.380
 room and very well fit that me 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.160
 'm wearing today 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.230
 However, that's really true for me today 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.850
 it was already true with it 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.440
 my favorite summer already i have 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.239

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.380

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.380
