00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
that will tear and these strips are

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.250 
that will tear and these strips are
about<00:00:22.140> 3/4<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:23.010> inch<00:00:23.160> wide<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.420> they're

about 56 inches long each you'll need a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.759 
about 56 inches long each you'll need a
small<00:00:29.449> circle<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> fabric<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.080> work<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.439> this

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
small circle of fabric to work on this

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.370 
small circle of fabric to work on this
is<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.279> piece<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:33.180> old<00:00:33.390> sweatshirt<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is just a piece of an old sweatshirt you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.520 
is just a piece of an old sweatshirt you
make<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.250> about<00:00:35.520> three<00:00:36.030> loops<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> time

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
make like about three loops at a time

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.060 
make like about three loops at a time
and<00:00:37.890> I'm<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.210> make<00:00:39.360> these<00:00:39.570> loops<00:00:40.070> about

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and I'm going to make these loops about

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
and I'm going to make these loops about
an<00:00:41.790> inch<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> half<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.469> inch

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
an inch and a half this is about an inch

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
an inch and a half this is about an inch
and<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> half<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.079> make

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and a half so I'm going to just make

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:57.010 
and a half so I'm going to just make
three<00:00:46.850> loops<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.180> my<00:00:48.480> hand

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.000 

like<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:57.890> just<00:00:58.580> spread<00:00:58.880> them<00:00:59.060> out<00:00:59.210> slightly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
like that just spread them out slightly

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.480 
like that just spread them out slightly
and<00:01:01.010> I'm<00:01:01.130> going<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.400> put<00:01:01.610> some<00:01:01.790> hot<00:01:02.000> glue<00:01:02.300> on<00:01:02.630> my

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
and I'm going to put some hot glue on my

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.430 
and I'm going to put some hot glue on my
circle<00:01:04.490> and<00:01:04.670> I'm<00:01:05.300> going<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.630> place<00:01:05.870> this<00:01:06.170> down

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
circle and I'm going to place this down

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.280 
circle and I'm going to place this down
into<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.070> hot<00:01:07.250> glue<00:01:10.330> like<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:14.020> let's<00:01:15.020> place

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
into the hot glue like that let's place

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.680 
into the hot glue like that let's place
a<00:01:15.320> dab<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.740> glue<00:01:16.250> under<00:01:16.700> each<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:17.180> these<00:01:17.360> layers

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
a dab of glue under each of these layers

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.010 
a dab of glue under each of these layers
just<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.350> hold<00:01:18.500> them<00:01:18.770> down<00:01:19.300> I'm<00:01:20.300> going<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.810> make

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
just to hold them down I'm going to make

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.900 
just to hold them down I'm going to make
another<00:01:21.860> three<00:01:22.730> loops<00:01:25.060> like<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:28.400> then

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
another three loops like that and then

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.960 
another three loops like that and then
I'm<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:29.090> going<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.600> lift<00:01:29.930> up<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.220> place<00:01:31.550> a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
I'm just going to lift up and place a

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.450 
I'm just going to lift up and place a
little<00:01:32.450> bit<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.750> hot<00:01:32.960> glue<00:01:32.990> under<00:01:33.710> each<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.280> of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
little bit of hot glue under each one of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.550 
little bit of hot glue under each one of
these<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.140> I'm<00:01:39.229> going<00:01:39.440> to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
these like that and I'm going to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.090 
these like that and I'm going to
continue<00:01:40.130> around<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:42.350> make<00:01:42.530> three<00:01:42.890> more

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
continue around just make three more

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.460 
continue around just make three more
loops<00:01:49.030> place<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.300> little<00:01:50.600> bit<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.840> glue<00:01:51.110> under

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
loops place a little bit of glue under

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.400 
loops place a little bit of glue under
each<00:01:51.650> one<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.869> continue<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.720> we'll<00:01:59.900> just<00:02:00.229> need

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
each one and continue so we'll just need

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.440 
each one and continue so we'll just need
that<00:02:00.619> one<00:02:00.680> last<00:02:01.250> one<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:04.119> then<00:02:05.119> I'm<00:02:05.270> just

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
that one last one and then I'm just

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.480 
that one last one and then I'm just
going<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.720> go<00:02:05.869> ahead<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.259> use<00:02:07.070> up<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
going to go ahead and use up the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.440 
going to go ahead and use up the
remainder<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:09.789> fabric<00:02:10.789> I'm<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.240> going

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
remainder of the fabric I'm just going

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.110 
remainder of the fabric I'm just going
to<00:02:11.510> make<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.930> row<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.200> loops<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.700> little

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
to make this row of loops just a little

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.950 
to make this row of loops just a little
bit<00:02:14.240> shorter<00:02:14.750> than<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.320> first<00:02:15.740> row<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:17.630> lot

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
bit shorter than the first row and a lot

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.030 
bit shorter than the first row and a lot
of<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.320> glue<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.620> still<00:02:19.360> hot<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:21.200> it's

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
of that glue is still hot and so it's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.610 
of that glue is still hot and so it's
still<00:02:22.430> grabbing<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.060> fabric<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.170> stop

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
still grabbing the fabric I just stop

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.370 
still grabbing the fabric I just stop
every<00:02:25.010> once<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.430> while<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:26.000> add<00:02:26.960> some<00:02:27.350> more

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
every once in a while and add some more

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.670 
every once in a while and add some more
glue<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.870> think<00:02:30.110> I'm<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.560> have

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
glue and I think I'm going to have

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:40.100 
glue and I think I'm going to have
enough<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.100> go<00:02:31.190> all<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.520> way<00:02:31.550> around<00:02:33.640> and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.040 

like<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.100> I'm<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.790> add<00:02:43.270> some

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
like that and I'm just going to add some

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.150 
like that and I'm just going to add some
glue<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:47.080> that's<00:02:47.320> going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.710> be<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.950> bottom

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
glue so that's going to be the bottom

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.610 
glue so that's going to be the bottom
layer<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.060> flower<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.780> have<00:02:50.110> another<00:02:50.350> piece

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
layer of the flower I have another piece

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.190 
layer of the flower I have another piece

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
of fabric and I'm going to start in the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.890
