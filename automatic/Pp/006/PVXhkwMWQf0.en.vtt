 nickelodeon we will use a steel cable all heard this year zero 6 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.470
 in the second one a very flexible one 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.789
 this has nothing to do with it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.499
 then we start with the first one 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.609
 we insert our stones in this case 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.779
 are two pearls is a fucking onyx but 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.759
 obviously the whole hour 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.460
 purely indicative 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.810
 we insert the stones 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.370
 we take you towards 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 a chief of chiefs 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.370
 when we arrive 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.380
 - this position 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 we pull at 90 degrees hd 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 with a round toe pliers I love you 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 brancaccio 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.470
 my name is inside the song 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.770
 our cellar 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.770
 movies to ask 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 the same we do on the other side 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.390
 let's ask 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 the fireplace at 90 degrees 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 we cut it of the measures we need 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 drowsiness world 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.410
 I love our rations 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 we insert another piece of cellar 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.440
 the very movies 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.420
 as you can see this is an acid or rather if it is easy to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.240
 to achieve 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.690
 toxic soccer shoes 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.540
 the second, however, what I prefer 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 it seems to me that you really want to be clean 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.860
 so 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.250
 it can be this way you put the cable 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.879
 libia map 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.669
 for double people 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.669
 Right now 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.889
 you start by inserting a steel bead 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.369
 then 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.679
 that you will be stones like before 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.599
 a pearl 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 piece of friends 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939
 and another pearl 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.209
 in the end we will put 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.479
 basketball siena 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.559
 we'll pass the dogs 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.559
 inside the other piece of catiline 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.199
 and then 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.179
 new environment 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.179
 inside you 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.179
 all your fields 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.879
 we will bring to sketch as close as possible to the stone we will start map 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.349
 we can maybe 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 help us economy caliper 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.779
 one piece at a time so work will be simpler 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.629
 when you are not registered cinecity parma 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.249
 sufficiently close 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.249
 to the person 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
 cinema crushers 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.489
 monica vitti in excess 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.819
 and using pliers 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.739
 cover moraschi in china 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.739
 with a sky sign cover in 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.610
 pussy doesn't come inside 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.050
 crush 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.620
 this will be the result 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.870
 on one side 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.090
 also in black steel sedan that we have 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.800
 threaded first 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.069
 on the other 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.419
 it looks like another steel skin but in fact it doesn't save fishing boats now 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.050
 this work will be very resistant 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.120
 and in my opinion cleaner 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.139
 I hope I have been helpful 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:50.989
 to the next
