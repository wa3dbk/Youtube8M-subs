00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.550
 bonbon first part of the aal to land 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.349
 we will rely on the motherboard 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.259
 and I will rely on the help of two auxiliaries 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.259
 the two children and the recapture 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.390
 in this class 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.109
 we talked about 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.859
 the basic structure of the motherboard 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.220
 and some of its main components 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.539
 the motherboard 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.560
 we see 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.660
 some parties understand themselves to be more observant of winning 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.140
 remembered a matter of proof 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.910
 as the part where it is 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 the memory 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.030
 the ram 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 Where do we do well? 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.760
 the collection 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.700
 the memory combs 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 How is it here? 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 of the cable that will connect the floppy disk drive 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.990
 here the idea 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.720
 natalegawa know 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.250
 breaking into the field 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 all United 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 since it is not good 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
 some of these lots explaining that being a woman 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 in turn each year are 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.890
 pci 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 why our well-known batches 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.550
 good here 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.830
 it's a lie 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.080
 collect 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.350
 the processor 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 the processor 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.850
 the main part 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.710
 the computer 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.450
 What is this cause? 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450
 has a certain form indications 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.530
 we can see 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.300
 that this board is already coming 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.410
 with several collections 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.410
 when these pieces 2 silver with the mouse sp 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.690
 the various components that we have today calmly the keyboard also mouse 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.680
 printer and scanner 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 cell phone digital camera 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.050
 here people known as 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 the parallel port who sticks 25 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.210
 the serial port 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.210
 bibi north in her truth 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.379
 After the photo of the cabul david collection 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.569
 why does this motherboard already have video 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.779
 tumbles 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.599
 so the young man 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.819
 to prepare brazil 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.910
 she also has her death so I have here the audio collections 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.719
 that makes sic 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 basically the motherboard was presented right 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.769
 now we'll see a little more detail 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:33.720
 calling these components
