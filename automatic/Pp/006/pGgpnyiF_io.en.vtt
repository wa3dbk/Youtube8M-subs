 this is one of the last novelties of the brand the new megane 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.649
 roadster 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.060
 but before you can enjoy it under the sun 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.180
 she went through there 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.339
 the machined george besse de gosse 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.210
 in the north of France 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.560
 from a simple piece of sheet metal to the finished product 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.410
 twenty hours and four thousand pieces are needed for the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.410
 vehicle assembly 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.329
 back on the main steps 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.329
 of his production 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.560
 stamping and the starting point of the process 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.600
 marine raw material in the form of bonuses drop 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 for a reminder of the facts on 25 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
 to lock 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.070
 to transform by default 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.010
 these press tools here they are 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.630
 it is these huge mold 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.630
 once powered a good sheet metal promotion their definitive form 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.460
 in total stamping daily transforms 940 tons of steel 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 second stage the sheet metal receives the two seasons boutih 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.369
 here the work is 99% mechanized 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.540
 de san diego is responsible for achieving the 4200 welding points required 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.560
 the betting market is off again 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.800
 dive into a pile of Master Corporal which surprised the defense of 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.930
 pursuers 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.999
 on this Tuesday morning beach to follow 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.600
 the refusal of corrosion 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 the sound system p the watertightness 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.810
 once the question had wiped the paint is applied to get the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.110
 final color 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 it is completed by a varnish 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.609
 assembly and last stage of manufacture 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.449
 it seemed to me if the driving position the interior trim of the vehicle and 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:14.539
 the miroiterie 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.589
 the mechanical motor elements are also called the boxes of 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.959
 speeds made in another factory 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.099
 in total this operation requires four hours twenty work 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 for customer satisfaction each operator 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.849
 I am trying to do well 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.949
 and in addition 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.429
 throughout the manufacturing process 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.829
 controls are but trade winds 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.519
 no 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.910
 but to be sure nothing was left to chance 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.030
 each vehicle and control back to 100% at the end of the chain 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.499
 the 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.499
 a 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:58.329
 these controls are done at peace but also the camps where there I advise the 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.209
 test tracks installed outside the machined 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.779
 and here is this megan coupe-cabriolet was ready remains only at the 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.189
 deliver it does not meet all the renault manufacturing criteria
