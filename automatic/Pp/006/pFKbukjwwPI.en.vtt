00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.259
 we are touching at this moment our 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.420
 melodic lines and we're 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.910
 superimposing a bass that gives us the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.889
 feeling of being in our chord 1 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.100
 of our progression 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.710
 the other two chords that we have 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.680
 our our blues sequence are 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.060
 the four chord the fourth grade of the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.190
 tonality and the fifth degree of the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.770
 hue where these two chords are 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.190
 the fourth grade is the slide in the fifth 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.190
 fret 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.060
 and the fifth grade is the slide in the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.060
 seventh fret 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.420
 then we will work the same as 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.310
 we were doing and we're going to go to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.310
 I agreed 4 we are doing well 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 that without compassion that does not have a 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 compass each group 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.360
 four groups of those two notes that we 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.210
 let's dial is a compass then 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.400
 for the fifth measure of our 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.650
 our subject we're going 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.080
 the greater it is then we would be left 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.080
 with 23 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810
 ah 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.410
 ah 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200
 how 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.780
 and we brake a jiffy then 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.100
 says four bars playing 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.100
 melodically on the reverse 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.909
 with the bass dialing for the fifth 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.860
 compass 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.660
 I went to the chord 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.660
 4 the greater sun 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.800
 ah 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.300
 and I return two more measures to the agreed 1 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.500
 where he could play melodically in 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.830
 this moment of chords 4 the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.990
 I'm just marking it as 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.760
 chord 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.780
 and how he came to accord 4 slipped 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.780
 complete from the third fret 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.260
 and it sounds very good that it sounds very 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.689
 dragged 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.140
 very altered the approach to the chord 4 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.140
 this 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.689
 ah 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.750
 I'm checking I'm washing the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.750
 thumb on the ropes 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.160
 and it's like what 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.740
 the flavors of the tower 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.250
 and when I come back I go back to the idea 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.250
 melodic 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 two 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 I go 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.420
 no way
