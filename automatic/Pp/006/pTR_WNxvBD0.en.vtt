00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.520
 Of gas 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.189
 it is falling 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.910
 this mixed greenfinch is an example of 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.440
 species bred entirely in captivity 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.900
 fruit of the crossing between a canary and a 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.510
 verderón with only four months 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.910
 miguelito that's the name is already a whole 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.250
 teacher and the variety of records of his 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.980
 sing is used to train the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.289
 rest he said so proud 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.289
 Gregorio Liner and an outstanding fan 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.460
 that accumulates everything through trophies and 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.460
 local recognitions 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.190
 and one of the most significant and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.890
 endearing the first prize obtained in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.010
 huelva in 2009 among fans of 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.020
 half spain with miguelito gregorio has 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.880
 found the perfect teacher to 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.089
 educate these other copies of 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.490
 true pure links in the process 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.320
 of copy are receptors of the song 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.300
 of miguelito or of the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.300
 recordings captured expressly 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.429
 5 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.729
 for it, wakefulness is helped by this 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.710
 small camera that isolated from the outside 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.810
 allows to record clear recordings of 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 remarkable species that then 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.729
 reproduce in the process of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.729
 training 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:46.030
 allies with technologies and educate the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.370
 true detriment to species like the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.370
 the jilguero the portillo 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.270
 it's the same park 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 and this is a canary and a person who 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:18.930
 it is 40 years I have been unemployed 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:23.550
 and how this is not the moment 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 first because I would try many 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.780
 many many awards many prizes and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.910
 besides not only ask here they ask 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.890
 I want you to go madrid-barcelona in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.750
 huelva wants to ask about the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 cute the worlds centers leaves us 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.930
 rest five birds now of the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.390
 five the one who knows how to pay as a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.230
 runner that we hunted ten days to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.990
 fuck me 15 for the whole year so that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.610
 five pairs and that all the fault is not to the 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.080
 hunter who says that we are going to 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.150
 destroy and I say no no no no 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.260
 gives with ten days of leave for one year 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.240
 whole 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.600
 and from the storm we no longer go to 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.580
 field 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.140
 we do not go and do not stop and do not put 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.260
 you hit when there are other things that are 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.970
 worse than what they should be removed to 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.830
 defend and protect this practice 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.870
 institutions like the city council of 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.330
 rate has recently approved a 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.460
 institutional motion calling for support 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.650
 of the Junta de Andalucia and the government 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.780
 of the nation is about making see in 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.700
 areas such as the European Union that the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 silvestrismo does not mean a threat 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.350
 for the continuity of the species of 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.660
 done its practice is regulated and in 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.460
 each day the trainer captures 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.580
 is enabled to remove a maximum 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.430
 of 5 specimens of its habitat the campaign 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.530
 of capture is limited to 10 days per year and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.450
 commonly the trainer returns to 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.880
 natural medium the specimens that do not 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.350
 they meet conditions for singing what 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.150
 explained emilio piñero like that 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.190
 highlighted the movement undertaken in 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.410
 all andalusia for the defense of this 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.420
 practice as a captor we are not 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.370
 hunters on their dates we were hunters 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.490
 but following a law that also the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.260
 year 78 created out there because they varied a lot 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.450
 the species decreased the species 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.010
 they stopped us from capturing only the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.840
 species that could 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.239
 breed in captivity and serve for the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.189
 singing competitions that is what we 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.420
 we devote civilians sad and clear 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.269
 that I want everyone to know that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.610
 we got married the one that the house takes between 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.110
 parentheses kill hunt them says the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.419
 word not we do not catch us 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.100
 we capture them and we are educators and 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.690
 after the autumnal period that we have 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.570
 which is established between October 12 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.979
 and on November 25, more or less if I 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.930
 I'm wrong in one day I think that few 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.550
 there is a door of birds of all 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.720
 these happens something during the year is 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.800
 show listening as you have seen 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.780
 before what do you have for example 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.220
 this amateur business these birds 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.620
 for then we return them back to their 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.479
 middle of the word silvestrismo because 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.300
 you are in contact with nature 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.330
 total a very beautiful practice very 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.220
 simple very simple we capture with 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.380
 Spanish that is a two-way swing 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.600
 leaves will not practically not hurt 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.280
 to the birds it has to be a very 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.960
 exceptional than a lamb of a bird 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.270
 or something but the truth that a practice 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 that there is no mortality a mortality 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.990
 minimum in for all the clubs of 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.490
 capture live and happens before and in the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.260
 same capture site means that 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.580
 if you pull the network so that we 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.920
 let's understand and with the 10 birds 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.810
 then a month and the others 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.250
 returns to the middle at that moment not 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.860
 we must forget those years that 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.960
 there was hunting for quite some time 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.120
 for another reason perhaps because of necessity 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.560
 because it was something that usually 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.780
 did that he captured those animals 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.460
 to hurt you commercial or even 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.110
 do what they had to do today 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.490
 you have to get out of your head that this 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.410
 has changed for a lot of years 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.680
 and that we what we dedicate ourselves to 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.880
 capture live to copy it to educate it 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.340
 and participate in competitions 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.990
 officers that there are in rates are more than 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.240
 a hundred fans to the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.540
 silvestrismo grouped in the club 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.170
 sporting quail and association 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.170
