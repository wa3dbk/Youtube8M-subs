you'll be able to layer these and see
what's<00:02:11.810> coming<00:02:12.200> before<00:02:13.330> when<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.480> put<00:02:14.870> an

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
what's coming before when you put an

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.530 
what's coming before when you put an
acrylic<00:02:15.470> medium<00:02:16.130> on<00:02:16.310> here<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.670> actually<00:02:16.820> turns

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
acrylic medium on here it actually turns

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.670

this<00:02:17.900> paper<00:02:18.200> from<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.920> page<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:20.680> translucent

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
this paper from a page to translucent

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.260 
this paper from a page to translucent
and<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> whole<00:02:23.120> idea<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.250> about

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
and this is the whole idea but about

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.320 
and this is the whole idea but about
encaustic<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.480> building<00:02:27.050> up<00:02:27.200> these<00:02:27.350> layers

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
encaustic is building up these layers

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.090 
encaustic is building up these layers
you<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.480> see<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:30.080> keep<00:02:30.350> building<00:02:30.680> these

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
you can see I can keep building these

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.810 
you can see I can keep building these
layers<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.110> use<00:02:33.350> an<00:02:33.530> acrylic<00:02:33.830> medium<00:02:34.580> in

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
layers and as I use an acrylic medium in

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.670 
layers and as I use an acrylic medium in
this<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.600> will<00:02:35.870> become<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.410> transparent

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
this it will become more transparent

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.570 
this it will become more transparent
it's<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.950> another<00:02:40.250> idea<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:45.260> one<00:02:45.590> you

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's just another idea and this one you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.850 
it's just another idea and this one you
could<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.020> idea<00:02:48.380> because<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.830> can

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
could I like this idea because you can

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.670 
could I like this idea because you can
work<00:02:49.160> with<00:02:49.340> your<00:02:49.460> composition<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:51.320> if<00:02:51.530> you

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
work with your composition so if you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.510 
work with your composition so if you
have<00:02:52.000> text<00:02:53.000> music<00:02:53.360> or<00:02:53.960> another<00:02:54.200> painting<00:02:54.800> you

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
have text music or another painting you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.730 
have text music or another painting you
can<00:02:55.550> get<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.850> preview<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.870> how<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.200> want<00:02:57.590> your

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
can get a preview of how you want your

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.800 
can get a preview of how you want your
piece<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.340> look<00:02:58.780> before<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.960> commit<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.710> it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
piece to look before you commit to it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.660 
piece to look before you commit to it
what<00:03:02.810> other<00:03:02.990> thing<00:03:03.320> we'll<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:03.890> doing<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.460> how

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
what other thing we'll be doing is how

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.720 
what other thing we'll be doing is how
to<00:03:04.730> embed<00:03:05.390> things<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:06.230> would<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.740> wax<00:03:07.040> so

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
to embed things like you would in wax so

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.790 
to embed things like you would in wax so
this<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:08.270> with<00:03:08.480> acrylic<00:03:09.080> not<00:03:09.350> with<00:03:09.530> wax

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
this is all with acrylic not with wax

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.890 
this is all with acrylic not with wax
but<00:03:10.190> things<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.580> actually<00:03:10.760> embedded<00:03:11.270> into

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
but things are actually embedded into

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.190 
but things are actually embedded into
the<00:03:12.050> layers<00:03:13.600> we're<00:03:14.600> going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.810> be<00:03:14.959> working

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
the layers we're going to be working

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.750 
the layers we're going to be working
with<00:03:15.760> shiny<00:03:16.760> surface<00:03:17.739> satin<00:03:18.739> surface<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
with shiny surface satin surface and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.880 
with shiny surface satin surface and
I'll<00:03:20.300> be<00:03:20.450> showing<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:20.959> how<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.140> alter<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
I'll be showing you how to alter the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.340 
I'll be showing you how to alter the
final<00:03:22.520> Sheen's<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.870> all<00:03:23.989> looks<00:03:24.020> like

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
final Sheen's so that it all looks like

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.900 
final Sheen's so that it all looks like
wax<00:03:26.230> I'm<00:03:27.230> also<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.160> be<00:03:28.340> showing<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.880> how

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
wax I'm also going to be showing you how

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.890 
wax I'm also going to be showing you how
to<00:03:29.180> mount<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.950> encaustic<00:03:31.850> look<00:03:32.450> on<00:03:32.690> two

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
to mount the encaustic look on two

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.780 
to mount the encaustic look on two
different<00:03:33.080> surfaces<00:03:33.830> we're<00:03:34.459> going<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.640> be

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
different surfaces we're going to be

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.160 
different surfaces we're going to be
working<00:03:35.030> on<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.600> stretched<00:03:36.350> canvas<00:03:37.120> is<00:03:38.120> one<00:03:38.959> way

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
working on a stretched canvas is one way

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.000 
working on a stretched canvas is one way
to<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.820> can<00:03:40.970> also<00:03:41.120> work<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:42.010> panel

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
to do it you can also work on a panel

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.150 
to do it you can also work on a panel
surface<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:45.290> these<00:03:45.500> are<00:03:45.800> some<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
surface so these are some of the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.190 
surface so these are some of the
techniques<00:03:46.610> that<00:03:46.820> we'll<00:03:47.090> cover<00:03:47.360> in<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.930> fun

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
techniques that we'll cover in the fun

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.620 
techniques that we'll cover in the fun
with<00:03:48.350> faux<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.770> costume<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.790> please<00:03:50.120> join<00:03:50.420> me

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
with faux and costume so please join me

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.290 
with faux and costume so please join me
