00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.539
 but all the guys are back with the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 nineteenth episode of the series 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 sniping in live 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.289
 first of all we would like to wish you well 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.989
 a my dad because just today at the party 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.960
 of the father and indeed wishes also to dry 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.870
 and not as you saw in the game 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 before I did two absurd failures of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 beautiful kipps 1 a triple collateral 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.329
 I don't know how he gave it to me and another 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.909
 that strange enough wrong to you 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.369
 the crowd of today guys will talk 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.839
 live together while i play like this 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:53.280
 going to be that smith col 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:01:00.030
 while a bartender because he doesn't 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.949
 was noticed triple and jazz mail because 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.000
 here I took it there with the easy escape 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.000
 to take in and shot the note today 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.270
 we'll talk about limits guys in my opinion 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 we are in a world where we set ourselves limits 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.820
 quite in fact the title of the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.370
 Today's video will be no limits because no 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.930
 limits and boys because in my opinion the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.490
 90 percent of what we believe 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.380
 your mother sister fucking mt the sniper 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.990
 that you play with the mass mc e 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.840
 in my opinion the major limits that there are 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 we put and there are no boys yes oh well 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.760
 eros focused on speaking launched the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.950
 Former sent not a reason why we have 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.049
 thought a little I reflected I said 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.049
 fuck guys we realize that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.260
 Rome 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.580
 bitch eva boys this was clip 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:15.430
 enough I know you took the fourth 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.630
 the fifth was clip was clip all the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.630
 life if I took the fourth the fifth 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.180
 don't ask me how he did it to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.040
 miss it and just all the limits that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.470
 we ask ourselves if in fact the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.530
 barriers of our brain in fact there 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.590
 Now obviously thought boys 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.820
 all the examples I will give you are 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.709
 related agreements because this is it 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.870
 that precisely in this situation there 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:47.380
 interest is precisely referred to cod 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.590
 then guys thought one when me 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.739
 I thought when I started playing 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.660
 that it was impossible to make a core of 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.780
 food fucking 30 kills are one thing 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.420
 there is infinite in a row and now boys and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.290
 I saw it as an insurmountable limit 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:12.790
 is to make a nuclear haga 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.840
 insurmountable, now I am here damn 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.299
 the train is here to offer you videos on 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.190
 nuclei therefore young girl most 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.049
 of the cases what we think you raise 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.019
 from the fucking we think we are 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.299
 impossible is what maybe one 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.560
 from the disaster with the pump what 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.700
 maybe one day he can give us from 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.200
 smile sure it is strange to think though 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.410
 that's what I mean by believe 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.370
 always in the things you do because nothing 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.820
 it's impossible 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.380
 I said well yesterday about doing some 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.239
 clip in fact lately is playing 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.459
 almost only with the sniper I would like if 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.489
 to relate some serious deal with 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.310
 really high level clips e 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.560
 restrained it is impossible to do 1 cod and c 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.970
 oct I'll never make you guys can 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.890
 ask also add that 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.330
 no who does not know the jumbo about the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.330
 death because zumbo and is the top type three 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.710
 hours later I wrote to him today I want 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.770
 give a quad and even if I see it 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.090
 impossible I helped a shaun tail 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.320
 also quite scraused because anyway 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.709
 it wasn't even a screen 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.329
 there is an 18 triple joe trolling but 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.140
 so how happy she was then 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.890
 guys understand that if you initially do 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.890
 think it's impossible 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.560
 another with split we are going to pick us up 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.560
 dylan 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:47.649
 how did I kill myself okay raga dai 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:49.539
 missing a kim ok guys 35 5 then in 

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:52.619
 practice the summary of what I wanted 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:57.849
 say always believe in what you do not 

00:04:52.619 --> 00:05:00.939
 never stop believing what you want 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.439
 so guys I hope you finally 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.520
