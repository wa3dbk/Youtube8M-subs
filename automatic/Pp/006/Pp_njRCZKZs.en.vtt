00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
with so with X is called The Hub and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.830 
with so with X is called The Hub and
with<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.540> substance<00:02:06.930> called<00:02:07.170> daily<00:02:07.500> briefing

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
with a substance called daily briefing

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.800 
with a substance called daily briefing
so<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.440> looks<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.250> bit<00:02:11.459> like

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
so it just looks a bit like

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.070 
so it just looks a bit like
this<00:02:12.340> they<00:02:13.340> got<00:02:13.580> excited<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.209> same<00:02:14.420> functions

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
this they got excited the same functions

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.790 
this they got excited the same functions
so<00:02:15.830> stops<00:02:16.220> news<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.590> name<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.950> whether<00:02:20.800> not

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
so stops news you name it whether not

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.820 
so stops news you name it whether not
much<00:02:21.980> difference<00:02:22.340> there<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:23.599> new<00:02:24.530> at<00:02:24.709> the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
much difference there but new at the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.680 
much difference there but new at the

what's<00:02:40.370> new<00:02:40.519> with<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.940> windows<00:02:41.630> phone<00:02:41.660> 7.5

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
what's new with a windows phone 7.5

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.289 
what's new with a windows phone 7.5
they've<00:02:42.620> got<00:02:42.800> they've<00:02:43.340> got<00:02:43.370> another<00:02:43.819> tasking

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
they've got they've got another tasking

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.270 
they've got they've got another tasking
and<00:02:44.420> with<00:02:44.930> multitasking<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.680> can<00:02:45.830> just

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
and with multitasking you can just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.070 
and with multitasking you can just
easily<00:02:46.549> swipe<00:02:47.000> switch<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.959> another

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
easily swipe switch to another

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.199 
easily swipe switch to another
application<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:52.310> looks<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:52.940> need

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
application and that looks that we need

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.400 
application and that looks that we need
somewhere<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.959> go<00:02:54.220> wap<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:59.090> not<00:02:59.480> asking<00:02:59.989> first

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
somewhere we go wap so not asking first

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.100 
somewhere we go wap so not asking first
grade<00:03:00.650> okay<00:03:01.519> also<00:03:01.910> they<00:03:02.000> got<00:03:02.180> about<00:03:02.420> photo

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
grade okay also they got about photo

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.479 
grade okay also they got about photo
enhancement<00:03:03.380> too<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.209> select<00:03:05.390> your<00:03:05.599> photo

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
enhancement too so you select your photo

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.650 
enhancement too so you select your photo
camera<00:03:07.489> album<00:03:07.819> or<00:03:09.190> uploads<00:03:10.420> facebook<00:03:11.420> and

camera album or uploads facebook and
then<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.440> can<00:03:12.650> make<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.790> even<00:03:13.959> better<00:03:14.959> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
then you can make it even better a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.590 
then you can make it even better a
different<00:03:17.870> thing<00:03:18.140> let's<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.250> wheres<00:03:20.209> assume

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
different thing let's see wheres assume

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.830 
different thing let's see wheres assume
the<00:03:20.870> marketplace<00:03:22.239> also<00:03:23.239> something<00:03:23.450> has<00:03:23.690> their

the social media integration it's also

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.190 
the social media integration it's also
really<00:03:48.560> tight<00:03:52.359> well<00:03:53.359> it<00:03:53.600> terms<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.930> speed

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
really tight well it terms of speed

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.460 
really tight well it terms of speed
which<00:03:54.530> one<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.920> faster<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:56.540> really<00:03:56.840> one<00:03:57.290> is

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
which one is faster not really one is

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.580 
which one is faster not really one is
faster<00:03:57.859> is<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.340> good<00:03:58.819> they've<00:03:59.720> got<00:04:00.019> both<00:04:00.350> got

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
faster is this good they've got both got

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.800 
faster is this good they've got both got
the<00:04:00.709> same<00:04:00.739> processor<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:01.370> set<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.540> don't

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
the same processor as set and you don't

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.569 
the same processor as set and you don't
really<00:04:03.079> see<00:04:03.319> much<00:04:03.560> difference<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:04.250> which

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
really see much difference in which

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.080 
really see much difference in which
faster<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.660> use<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.079> which<00:04:06.470> isn't<00:04:07.090> about

faster in use and which isn't about

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.300 
faster in use and which isn't about
there's<00:04:08.329> three<00:04:08.569> fast<00:04:08.900> it's<00:04:09.470> also<00:04:09.709> because<00:04:10.160> of

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
there's three fast it's also because of

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.309 
there's three fast it's also because of
the<00:04:10.340> OS<00:04:10.790> when<00:04:11.389> it's<00:04:11.540> funny<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.900> don't<00:04:12.049> see

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
the OS when it's funny you don't see

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.720 
the OS when it's funny you don't see
much<00:04:12.470> difference<00:04:12.530> when<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.190> comes<00:04:13.370> to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
much difference when it comes to

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.180 
much difference when it comes to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220

it's<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.700> bit<00:04:56.880> too<00:04:57.090> big<00:04:57.270> for<00:04:57.480> our<00:04:57.510> test<00:04:57.870> we'd

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
it's a bit too big for our test we'd

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.850 
it's a bit too big for our test we'd
like<00:04:58.680> more<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.220> size<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.180> 4.3<00:05:00.930> inch<00:05:01.110> we
