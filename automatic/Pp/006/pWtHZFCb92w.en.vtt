video I'm gonna explain what my sky

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.169 
video I'm gonna explain what my sky
island<00:00:07.649> challenges<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.550> I'm<00:00:08.790> also<00:00:08.970> gonna

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
island challenges and I'm also gonna

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.299 
island challenges and I'm also gonna
explain<00:00:09.570> how<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.929> can<00:00:10.200> set<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.860> get

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
explain how you can set it up and get

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:11.930 
explain how you can set it up and get
started

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
started

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.990 
started
so<00:00:12.300> basically<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.650> sky<00:00:14.040> block<00:00:14.370> map<00:00:14.759> and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
so basically it's a sky block map and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.029 
so basically it's a sky block map and
what<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.440> basically<00:00:16.470> where<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
what that is it's basically where you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
what that is it's basically where you
have<00:00:17.070> an<00:00:17.340> island<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> sky

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
have an island like this up in the sky

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710 
have an island like this up in the sky
as<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.650> might<00:00:19.800> assume<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.180> certain

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
as you might assume and you have certain

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.540 
as you might assume and you have certain
challenges<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.680> must<00:00:22.920> complete<00:00:23.369> in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
challenges that you must complete in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.759 
challenges that you must complete in
order<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.449> complete<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> map<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.439> I'm<00:00:25.650> gonna

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
order to complete the map and I'm gonna

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.640 
order to complete the map and I'm gonna
be<00:00:25.949> setting<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.460> via<00:00:27.269> unlisted<00:00:28.260> videos

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
be setting them via unlisted videos

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.870 
be setting them via unlisted videos
which<00:00:28.980> will<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.220> linked<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> description

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
which will be linked in the description

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
which will be linked in the description
to<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.449> video<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> need<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> build

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to this video and so you need to build

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
to this video and so you need to build
an<00:00:32.250> island<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.210> very<00:00:33.320> few

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
an island up here you have very few

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
an island up here you have very few
resources<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.430> you're<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
resources and you're gonna try and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.260 
resources and you're gonna try and
survive<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> tell<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> do

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
survive and do what I tell you to do

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
survive and do what I tell you to do
basically<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.260> video<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.739> gonna

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
basically so in this video I'm gonna

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
basically so in this video I'm gonna
tell<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> build<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.809> then

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
tell you how to build this and then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
tell you how to build this and then
obviously<00:00:43.620> set<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.579> first<00:00:44.789> challenge

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
obviously set you your first challenge

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
obviously set you your first challenge
as<00:00:45.300> well<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.930> started<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.530> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
as well so you can get started and this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
as well so you can get started and this
can<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.920> done<00:00:46.950> either<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.940> PC<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.539> Xbox<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
can be done either on PC or Xbox you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
can be done either on PC or Xbox you
don't<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> download<00:00:50.670> anything<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.930> can

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
don't need to download anything you can

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.750 
don't need to download anything you can
just<00:00:52.110> literally<00:00:52.590> build<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.309> I'm<00:00:53.399> building

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
just literally build what I'm building

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.430 
just literally build what I'm building
now<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:53.969> creative<00:00:54.390> mode<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.260> get

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
now in creative mode and then get

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.020 
now in creative mode and then get
started<00:00:55.680> straightaway<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> first<00:00:56.940> thing

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
started straightaway so the first thing

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
started straightaway so the first thing
you<00:00:57.090> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.420> build<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.079> pillar<00:00:58.320> which<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you need to do build a pillar which is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
you need to do build a pillar which is
exactly<00:00:59.100> 45<00:00:59.640> blocks<00:01:00.210> high<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:01.050> pretty<00:01:01.289> sure

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
exactly 45 blocks high I'm pretty sure

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139 
exactly 45 blocks high I'm pretty sure
that<00:01:01.559> isn't<00:01:01.739> 45<00:01:02.280> blocks<00:01:02.609> high<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.059> will

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
that isn't 45 blocks high but that will

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.060 
that isn't 45 blocks high but that will
do<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.290> she<00:01:04.379> doesn't<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.949> be

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
do for now that she doesn't have to be

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
do for now that she doesn't have to be
exactly<00:01:05.519> 45<00:01:05.939> blocks<00:01:06.420> high<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.810> long<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.080> it's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
exactly 45 blocks high as long as it's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.090 
exactly 45 blocks high as long as it's
between<00:01:07.920> 40<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.670> 50<00:01:09.180> you'll<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.810> fine<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
between 40 and 50 you'll be fine but the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
between 40 and 50 you'll be fine but the
height<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> affect<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
height does kind of affect some of the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.820 
height does kind of affect some of the
challenges<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> between<00:01:15.210> 40<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
challenges so do have it between 40 and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
challenges so do have it between 40 and
50<00:01:16.830> blocks<00:01:17.100> high<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.450> need<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> build<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
50 blocks high you then need to build a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
50 blocks high you then need to build a
platform<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:20.070> obsidian<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.210> needs<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
platform of obsidian and this needs to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649 
platform of obsidian and this needs to
be<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.600> square<00:01:22.049> which<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.650> 7<00:01:23.100> by<00:01:23.369> 7<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
be a square which is 7 by 7 and the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
be a square which is 7 by 7 and the
easiest<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.830> build

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
easiest way to do that is just build

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.859 
easiest way to do that is just build
your<00:01:26.400> middle<00:01:26.759> block<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.450> free<00:01:27.750> out

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
your middle block and then go free out

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
your middle block and then go free out
either<00:01:28.080> side<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.400> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
either side and then you kind of got the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
either side and then you kind of got the
base<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.420> sky<00:01:30.840> island<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.710> made<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
base of your sky island here made out of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
base of your sky island here made out of
obsidian<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.270> second<00:01:33.689> layer<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.380> want

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
obsidian and the second layer you want

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.819 
obsidian and the second layer you want
to<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.860> cover<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.090> dirt<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.829> eventually

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
to do cover it in dirt and eventually

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
to do cover it in dirt and eventually
you're<00:01:37.979> gonna<00:01:38.130> add<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.610> more<00:01:38.820> stuff<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.329> this

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you're gonna add some more stuff in this

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.420 
you're gonna add some more stuff in this
layer<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.110> easier<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.619> lay<00:01:41.159> down

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
layer but it's easier just to lay down

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
layer but it's easier just to lay down
all<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> dirt<00:01:42.030> first<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.840> sort<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
all the dirt first it's just sort of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
all the dirt first it's just sort of
your<00:01:44.009> base<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.180> middle

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
your base you know for the the middle

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.260 
your base you know for the the middle
filling<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.530> guys<00:01:46.770> sky<00:01:47.189> island<00:01:47.700> sandwich<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
filling or guys sky island sandwich I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.300 
filling or guys sky island sandwich I
might<00:01:48.450> call<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.829> layer<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
might call it and then on this layer you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.270 
might call it and then on this layer you
also<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> add<00:01:51.060> along<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> side<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.290> row<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
also want to add along the side a row of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.959 
also want to add along the side a row of
diamonds<00:01:53.939> 1<00:01:54.210> 2<00:01:54.600> 3<00:01:55.020> 4<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.310> that's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
diamonds 1 2 3 4 and then that's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.370 
diamonds 1 2 3 4 and then that's
supposed<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.329> dirt<00:01:57.570> there<00:01:57.750> sorry<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.170> 4

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
supposed to be dirt there sorry so 4

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.590 
supposed to be dirt there sorry so 4
diamonds<00:01:58.770> along<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.479> on

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
diamonds along like that and then on

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 
diamonds along like that and then on
this<00:02:00.780> side<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.079> need<00:02:01.469> 6<00:02:01.950> iron<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
this side you need 6 iron so you want to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.249 
this side you need 6 iron so you want to
go<00:02:02.969> 5<00:02:03.270> along<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.290> iron<00:02:04.860> 1<00:02:05.700> 2<00:02:05.969> 3<00:02:06.210> 4<00:02:06.659> 5<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
go 5 along here of iron 1 2 3 4 5 and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.389 
go 5 along here of iron 1 2 3 4 5 and
also<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> middle<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.039> there

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
also on the middle one there

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.919 
also on the middle one there
just<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.849> more<00:02:09.000> sticking<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.539> you've<00:02:09.810> got

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
just one more sticking out so you've got

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.260 
just one more sticking out so you've got
6<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.500> pieces<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:11.009> iron<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.550> top<00:02:12.090> layer

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
6 there pieces of iron and the top layer

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.920 
6 there pieces of iron and the top layer
is<00:02:12.690> pretty<00:02:13.200> much<00:02:13.349> all

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
is pretty much all

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.170 
is pretty much all
sand<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.709> there<00:02:14.920> are<00:02:15.040> once<00:02:15.280> again<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.700> few

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
sand and there are once again a few

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
sand and there are once again a few
things<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.480> need<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.659> add<00:02:16.870> afterwards<00:02:17.409> but

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
things you need to add afterwards but

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.899 
things you need to add afterwards but
it's<00:02:17.709> easier<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.189> fill<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.549> layer<00:02:18.700> in

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
it's easier just to fill the layer in

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.819 
it's easier just to fill the layer in
with<00:02:19.090> sand<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.989> add<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.349> other<00:02:20.530> things

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
with sand and then add the other things

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.009 
with sand and then add the other things
to<00:02:21.069> make<00:02:21.219> the<00:02:21.400> face<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.939> my<00:02:22.180> sky<00:02:22.450> island

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
to make the face of my sky island

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.229 
to make the face of my sky island
challenge<00:02:23.439> its<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.129> faced<00:02:24.519> sandwich

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
challenge its like a faced sandwich

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.880 
challenge its like a faced sandwich
that's<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.719> sky<00:02:25.900> island<00:02:26.349> challenge<00:02:26.709> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that's what the sky island challenge is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.280 
that's what the sky island challenge is
and<00:02:27.159> then<00:02:27.760> yeah<00:02:27.969> you<00:02:28.060> want<00:02:28.239> one<00:02:28.299> block<00:02:29.079> up

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and then yeah you want one block up

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.990 
and then yeah you want one block up
there<00:02:29.530> where<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:29.890> gonna<00:02:30.040> shove<00:02:30.310> down<00:02:30.519> one

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
there where you gonna shove down one

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.990 
there where you gonna shove down one
sapling<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.590> eyes<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.219> want<00:02:33.340> two<00:02:33.609> pieces

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
sapling for the eyes you want two pieces

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.300 
sapling for the eyes you want two pieces
of<00:02:34.030> ice<00:02:34.450> which<00:02:34.750> are<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.079> one<00:02:35.829> in<00:02:36.040> from

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
to do in order to build it and your

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.819 
to do in order to build it and your
pillar<00:02:46.599> obviously<00:02:47.139> you<00:02:47.260> want<00:02:47.379> to<00:02:47.470> come<00:02:47.650> down

pillar obviously you want to come down

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.979 
pillar obviously you want to come down
here<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.849> just<00:02:48.879> want<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.239> get<00:02:49.359> a<00:02:49.389> torch<00:02:49.750> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
here and you just want to get a torch I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.110 
here and you just want to get a torch I
mean<00:02:50.139> I<00:02:50.230> built<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> pillar<00:02:50.799> out<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.159> sand<00:02:51.879> so<00:02:52.060> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
mean I built the pillar out of sand so I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.670 
mean I built the pillar out of sand so I
can<00:02:52.239> easily<00:02:52.389> get<00:02:52.659> rid<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.439> could<00:02:53.560> do

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
can easily get rid of it you could do

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.170 
can easily get rid of it you could do
out<00:02:53.859> of<00:02:53.889> gravel<00:02:54.340> as<00:02:54.430> well<00:02:54.609> so<00:02:54.819> that<00:02:54.970> will<00:02:55.090> all

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
out of gravel as well so that will all

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.020 
out of gravel as well so that will all
very<00:02:56.109> gradually<00:02:56.739> fall<00:02:57.040> down<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.669> get

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
very gradually fall down and get

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.789 
very gradually fall down and get
destroyed<00:02:58.419> because<00:02:59.230> you're<00:02:59.349> not<00:02:59.439> supposed<00:02:59.709> to

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
destroyed because you're not supposed to

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.349 
destroyed because you're not supposed to
have<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.069> pillar<00:03:00.280> there<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.120> all<00:03:01.269> you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
have the pillar there and then all you

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.509 
have the pillar there and then all you
need<00:03:01.419> to<00:03:01.569> do<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.930> get<00:03:02.079> started<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.739> stand<00:03:03.340> on

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
need to do to get started is stand on

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.429 
need to do to get started is stand on
the<00:03:03.609> island<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.359> save<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.109> game

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
the island like this save the game

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.629 
the island like this save the game
switch<00:03:06.219> over<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.609> survival<00:03:07.329> mode<00:03:07.359> and<00:03:07.840> then

your resources it's very easy to run out

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.830 
your resources it's very easy to run out
of<00:04:15.669> things<00:04:16.060> make<00:04:16.359> sure<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:16.659> don't

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
of things make sure you don't

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.749 
of things make sure you don't
accidentally<00:04:17.829> craft<00:04:18.250> something<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.669> you

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
accidentally craft something that you

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.909 
accidentally craft something that you
don't<00:04:18.880> want<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.239> do<00:04:19.419> because<00:04:20.259> if<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.650> fail

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
don't want to do because if you fail

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.560 
don't want to do because if you fail
then<00:04:21.310> game<00:04:21.609> over<00:04:21.969> you've<00:04:22.120> got<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.300> start<00:04:22.479> again

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
then game over you've got to start again

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.209 
then game over you've got to start again
from<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.020> beginning<00:04:23.409> so<00:04:23.590> it's<00:04:23.740> going<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.919> be<00:04:24.039> a

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:24.219 
from the beginning so it's going to be a

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:26.490 
from the beginning so it's going to be a
very<00:04:24.729> difficult<00:04:25.000> challenge<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:26.260> hopefully

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
very difficult challenge so hopefully

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.660 
very difficult challenge so hopefully
I've<00:04:26.590> made<00:04:26.710> myself<00:04:26.889> clear<00:04:27.219> and

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
I've made myself clear and

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.340 
I've made myself clear and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
of what you've got to do at the end of

this video I'm going to put up a picture
which<00:04:31.300> shows<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.780> exactly<00:04:32.200> how<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.560> build

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
which shows you exactly how to build

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.980 
which shows you exactly how to build
each<00:04:33.160> layer<00:04:33.460> again<00:04:33.820> in<00:04:34.300> case<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.600> did<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.870> too

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
each layer again in case I did it too

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.840 
each layer again in case I did it too
quickly<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.530> video<00:04:35.770> but<00:04:36.430> that's<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.700> for
