now<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.510> always<00:03:26.810> put<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.350> back<00:03:27.950> pickup<00:03:28.370> down

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
now I always put the back pickup down

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.520 
now I always put the back pickup down
low<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.390> makes<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.780> front<00:03:30.020> pickup<00:03:30.290> have

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
low so it makes the front pickup have

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.190 
low so it makes the front pickup have
more<00:03:30.830> of<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.580> beautiful<00:03:32.090> more<00:03:32.330> beautiful<00:03:32.660> tone
