00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 this is a French court ball its 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.860
 round segments allowed to save 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.360
 material and they gave it a distinctive stamp 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.040
 that remained in everyone's memory 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.640
 those who enjoyed it over the years 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.020
 70 this is leather and it was handmade 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 by a man who has managed to maintain 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.380
 live a great tradition of the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.380
 super crack star balls 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.220
 that the ball is my life since I 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.190
 I have conscience I have always known the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.600
 balls and I'm talking about doing 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:51.339
 50 years quietly star are going to 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.309
 be in Guanajuato 1954 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.399
 my dad, he's already doing his pininos 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.890
 making their own balls in which 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.210
 the possible time then pure ball of 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.700
 skin was known just this is a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.369
 I stretch a piece of what this in 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 given increase would become a 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.640
 ball 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.590
 this is a relic is a ball 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 totally made of skin skin that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.820
 right up to the year 1972 by 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:34.220
 just in August I remember that 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.610
 there was a skin or skin crisis and 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 the vinyl ball began to be manufactured 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 a dad 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.020
 and I started with evolution 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.110
 totally a change but radical yes there 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.440
 is where the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.310
 it was glorious then in any case of 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.650
 the family alarcón then we had the idea 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.890
 from the idea of ​​getting to the first one 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.700
 division be the official ball of the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 first division in football all 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.009
 teams were autonomous in the aspect in 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.440
 this about it because everyone put 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.390
 his ball because it was better for him 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.910
 in the values ​​relatively to the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.060
 equipment we did not sell them from the h that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.680
 we go with exchange other balls that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.220
 will play with the ball all the wakes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.750
 qualifying for concacaf in 1,178 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.330
 to all those parties 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 they played here in mexico at least 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.200
 with a star ball they will remember a cat 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.410
 marin 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.280
 if he built that blunder on the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.959
 gran miguel marín some movies that 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.500
 was pleased to decision 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.990
 roberto bolaños the chanfle and went with 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.190
 stars and it was like that 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.730
 let's say we came also the lord 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.590
 antonio garcia with his garcía and between 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.620
 finish moment then we were the balls 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.530
 super crack and garcís star officers 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.680
 and later in the years 1982 83 is 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.970
 when a movement already comes in which 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.550
 it's no longer going to be easy that you no longer have 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.220
 other teams no longer have that freedom 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.910
 for them to put their ball to play 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.300
 but the economic aspect already enters 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.890
 in which there is no longer freedom 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.890
 and a brand comes in 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.319
 Well, I do not think it's properly 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.920
 forgotten because then if not if 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.200
 forgotten since there was no star 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.900
 but nevertheless here we are and if 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.120
 we are told if not as the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.629
 first but here we are and we continue 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.629
 counting 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.689
 and today it's still here in Mexico 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.590
 clearly one hundred percent before anal and 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.590
 he worked on the value 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.629
 two 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.409
 as football would say colloquially 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.019
 I live by the kick 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:43.720
 well and as I did not learn to do anything else 

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:47.140
 I am balloners distributed to my children 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.930
 it's a satisfaction now before I could 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.900
 have felt a little bit like that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:57.000
 prohibit or not the ball ero yes yes but 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.480
 how many values are 50 years old 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.630
 all life all life of 50 years of 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:08.120
 I was born and I do not think I'm going to 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.120
 dying in the values ​​like this is 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.439
 when returning on the other side of the ball 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.169
 know the history of the trompe-l'oeil 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.799
 scorer of the first Mexican goal in a 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.799
 world cup
