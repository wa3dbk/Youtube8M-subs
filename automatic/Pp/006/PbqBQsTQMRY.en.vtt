00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
can see there's no goalie to be found I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.509 
can see there's no goalie to be found I
can't<00:02:44.230> replace<00:02:44.470> him<00:02:44.769> because<00:02:45.130> he's<00:02:45.310> already

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
can't replace him because he's already

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.500

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.449 
out there
I<00:02:46.540> even<00:02:47.079> tried<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.920> previous<00:02:48.280> game

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
I even tried in the previous game

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.940 
I even tried in the previous game
switching<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.359> my<00:02:49.510> other<00:02:49.690> goalie<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.590> didn't

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
switching to my other goalie it didn't

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.770 
switching to my other goalie it didn't
seem<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.190> work<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.700> would<00:02:51.850> work<00:02:52.060> for<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.329> second

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
seem to work it would work for a second

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.110 
seem to work it would work for a second
and<00:02:52.870> then<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.380> would<00:02:53.470> glitch<00:02:53.709> out<00:02:54.120> randomly

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and then it would glitch out randomly

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.009 
and then it would glitch out randomly
later<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.049> game<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.390> next<00:02:58.390> don't<00:02:58.660> adjust

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
later on the game and next don't adjust
