speaker not much to talk about but there

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
speaker not much to talk about but there
are<00:01:29.579> these<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:29.790> grippy<00:01:30.600> strips<00:01:30.990> which<00:01:31.259> help

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
are these two grippy strips which help

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
are these two grippy strips which help
it<00:01:31.650> from<00:01:31.829> sliding<00:01:32.280> around<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.140> wooden

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it from sliding around on a wooden

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
it from sliding around on a wooden
surface<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> glass<00:01:35.430> surface<00:01:36.060> any<00:01:36.390> smooth

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
surface or a glass surface any smooth
surface<00:01:36.840> will<00:01:37.680> prevent<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> from<00:01:38.250> slipping

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
surface will prevent it from slipping

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
surface will prevent it from slipping
around<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> first<00:01:40.110> turn<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> unit<00:01:40.799> on

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
around when you first turn the unit on

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
around when you first turn the unit on
it<00:01:41.610> goes<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:42.060> bluetooth<00:01:42.540> pairing<00:01:42.899> mode<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it goes into bluetooth pairing mode and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.160 
it goes into bluetooth pairing mode and
this<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.430> oscillate<00:01:44.670> between<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.479> red<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> a

this will oscillate between a red and a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.929 
this will oscillate between a red and a
blue<00:01:46.409> light<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.890> show<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.579> pairing

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
blue light to show that it's in pairing

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.060 
blue light to show that it's in pairing
mode<00:01:47.970> since<00:01:48.869> I've<00:01:49.079> already<00:01:49.229> paired<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> with

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
mode since I've already paired it with

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830

my iPhone which is nearby

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.819 
my iPhone which is nearby
once<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> pairs<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> turns<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.299> blue

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829

what<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.100> makes<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.030> totally<00:01:57.509> unique<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
what really makes this totally unique is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.850 
what really makes this totally unique is
that<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.340> has<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> touch<00:02:00.119> panel<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> top<00:02:01.229> now

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
in bright light it's a little hard to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
in bright light it's a little hard to
see<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.340> only<00:02:06.290> only<00:02:07.310> negative
