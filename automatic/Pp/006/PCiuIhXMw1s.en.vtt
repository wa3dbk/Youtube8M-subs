00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi friends here is crap 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 bringing you this this tutorial that I 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.410
 asked for xiomara navarrete morals 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.619
 facebook she is from costa rica and I 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.230
 he asked if I could teach him how I 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.080
 I make hearts and I will be using 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.539
 this color that is one red 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.990
 and from this easy flow collection 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.329
 Y 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.760
 it's like this is a very beautiful color very 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:42.010
 intense perfect for hearts and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.220
 Here I'll teach first week 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.720
 nothing thanks for the confidence that I 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.860
 do you have 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.450
 and here I will show you how I do the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.760
 hearts 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:01.690
 to stop with some girls use 50% 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 monomer and 50% acetone I use it 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.610
 number by is already in you if you want 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 change or if you want to try to see what 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.780
 way you have this better but I use 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.860
 only the monomer here I already took the pearl 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.409
 did not apply it then it was left here if 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.830
 you see here it has like a little lumps 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.440
 I let the pearl be made and then 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.170
 already applied here 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.240
 and then dragged it down like 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.240
 forming a droplet 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.439
 and dragged it down like this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.470
 then I take a second pearl 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 and I do the same 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.680
 did not apply it then let it be done 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.680
 the pearl 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 and then I apply it up as well as 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.090
 level and I drag it back towards 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.090
 down to join it with the first 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 the same dragged 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.170
 down below 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.940
 and that's how the first heart is 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.760
 this one looks pretty and looks pretty like 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.310
 for third dimension what is left 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.640
 tito 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.670
 but if you want it to encapsulate you 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.170
 I recommend that you make it more flat to 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.290
 that the time that encapsulates does not stay 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.409
 so thick the nail 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.329
 and it 's like the flattest list 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.780
 if you apply the pearl a little more 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.780
 wet 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.260
 equal to equal dredges and then the flat ones 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.960
 little bit without losing the shape of the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.920
 droplet 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.920
 on the flat 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.530
 and there is more planet left than the first 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.549
 then take the second pearl trying 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.549
 that is the same size 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.170
 with the harrows also down 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.780
 and the flat 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.810
 and someone trained in the heart 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.030
 and more flat so you do not stay 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.030
 thick the nail when encapsulating the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.020
 there is 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.080
 nothing more like that blurs him is with the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.770
 second stick so they look together and 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.160
 do not look like two the two pearls and already 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.110
 what together 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.940
 and so you want to go back if you want more 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.410
 peaks and it 's nothing more than you pikes 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.750
 here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.650
 since after the most formed heart is 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.720
 he wants more 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.900
 it depends on the taste of the heart that you 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.750
 want to do 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.740
 and it looks like from the side 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.800
 you see this more flat and be more maya in 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.100
 Third dimension 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.030
 but I will do here once 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.030
 so you see 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.850
 malone 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.380
 I do not let the pearl be made 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.980
 then I apply 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.140
 I do not work or ice then 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.300
 and then dragged her 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.810
 as the second pearl 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.810
 Y 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.370
 and applied 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.260
 then he dragged her to join him with the 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.330
 first 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.220
 and I carry a little bit of the acrylic 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.030
 second part of the first so that it 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.030
 places 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.510
 full of anxiety the heart shape 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.520
 and here is the time if you want 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.850
 flatten it if you want to leave it so 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.030
 you press it so much if you want to flatten 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.030
 she gives him the to flatten her 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.210
 there is 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.099
 and so of any color you want 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:30.309
 do any size is the same with two 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:33.249
 dogs one crawls to the car like that 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:36.240
 see drops or the second applies the 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:39.479
 dredges and the uned 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.819
 and you have the hearts I hope that 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.280
 this video serves any doubt that 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:47.699
 Have me send it to me with a lot 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.000
 clear I congrated thank you and thank you all 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.000
