she<00:01:01.800> probably<00:01:02.129> didn't<00:01:02.489> tell<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:02.879> she<00:01:03.329> was

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
she probably didn't tell I think she was

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
she probably didn't tell I think she was
going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.809> dumb<00:01:04.019> enough<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.439> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
going to be dumb enough to do that in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
going to be dumb enough to do that in
this<00:01:05.159> case<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.610> also<00:01:05.760> knew<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.299> there

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this case they also knew he was there

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
this case they also knew he was there
which<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.689> why<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> ribbon<00:01:07.260> left<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:07.799> behind

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
which is why the ribbon left from behind

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300 
which is why the ribbon left from behind
and<00:01:08.570> she<00:01:09.570> almost<00:01:10.020> died<00:01:10.560> oh<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.100> doesn't

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and she almost died oh but it doesn't

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
and she almost died oh but it doesn't
matter<00:01:11.369> anyway<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> same<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:12.990> applies
