olive<00:00:13.160> drab<00:00:13.400> now<00:00:15.010> over<00:00:16.010> here<00:00:16.279> the<00:00:16.820> area<00:00:17.060> for

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
olive drab now over here the area for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.660 
olive drab now over here the area for
the<00:00:17.420> final<00:00:17.690> drive<00:00:17.900> I<00:00:18.230> don't<00:00:18.949> like<00:00:19.130> to<00:00:19.279> have<00:00:19.430> too

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
the final drive I don't like to have too

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.820 
the final drive I don't like to have too
much<00:00:19.820> paint<00:00:20.119> on<00:00:20.270> this<00:00:20.449> area<00:00:20.780> because<00:00:21.170> the

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
much paint on this area because the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.620 
much paint on this area because the
layers<00:00:22.370> of<00:00:22.550> paint<00:00:22.580> can<00:00:22.940> interfere<00:00:23.300> with<00:00:23.360> the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
layers of paint can interfere with the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.840 
layers of paint can interfere with the
gears<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:24.770> I<00:00:24.800> like<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.220> do<00:00:25.310> is<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:25.460> just<00:00:25.490> like<00:00:25.760> to

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
gears so I like to do is I just like to

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.820 
gears so I like to do is I just like to
have<00:00:26.060> just<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:26.390> simple<00:00:26.570> coat<00:00:26.900> of<00:00:27.050> primer<00:00:27.289> on<00:00:27.470> and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
have just a simple coat of primer on and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.550 
have just a simple coat of primer on and
then<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.460> like<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:28.850> mask<00:00:29.120> this<00:00:29.330> area<00:00:29.690> up<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.380> when

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
then I like to mask this area up so when

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.340 
then I like to mask this area up so when
I<00:00:30.650> paint<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.220> base<00:00:31.880> coat<00:00:32.180> on<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:32.989> area<00:00:33.260> here

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
I paint the base coat on this area here

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.799 
I paint the base coat on this area here
is<00:00:33.649> as<00:00:34.219> thin<00:00:34.550> as<00:00:34.670> possible<00:00:34.730> which<00:00:35.420> will<00:00:35.449> make

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
is as thin as possible which will make

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.360 
is as thin as possible which will make
mounting<00:00:36.410> of<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.530> final<00:00:36.860> drives<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.250> lot

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
mounting of the final drives a lot

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.410 
mounting of the final drives a lot
easier<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:39.260> do<00:00:39.440> this<00:00:39.650> I<00:00:39.890> have<00:00:40.130> to<00:00:40.160> mask<00:00:40.910> up<00:00:41.210> the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
easier to do this I have to mask up the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.120 
easier to do this I have to mask up the
area<00:00:41.750> for<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:43.340> final<00:00:43.700> drive<00:00:43.910> housing<00:00:44.980> as<00:00:45.980> you

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
area for the final drive housing as you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.470 
area for the final drive housing as you
can<00:00:46.250> see<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.489> final<00:00:46.670> drives<00:00:46.940> are<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.210> little

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
can see the final drives are a little

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.590 
can see the final drives are a little
bit<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.720> an<00:00:47.810> elaborate<00:00:48.140> shape<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.560> so<00:00:49.600> massing

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
bit of an elaborate shape and so massing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.780 
bit of an elaborate shape and so massing
the<00:00:50.720> area<00:00:51.020> could<00:00:51.590> be<00:00:51.649> a<00:00:51.800> bit<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.340> hassle

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
the area could be a bit of a hassle

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.290 
the area could be a bit of a hassle
however<00:00:53.660> with<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.050> simple<00:00:54.410> tutorial

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
however with this simple tutorial

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.569 
however with this simple tutorial
masking<00:00:56.300> up<00:00:56.420> areas<00:00:56.899> on<00:00:57.110> these<00:00:57.800> armored<00:00:58.280> tanks

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
masking up areas on these armored tanks

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.430 
masking up areas on these armored tanks
doesn't<00:00:59.270> matter<00:00:59.420> what<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.690> if<00:00:59.809> it's<00:00:59.930> Tiger<00:01:00.260> one

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
doesn't matter what is if it's Tiger one

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.480 
final drive take the internal portion
here<00:01:25.999> and<00:01:26.119> lay<00:01:26.389> it<00:01:26.569> flat<00:01:27.189> then<00:01:28.189> we<00:01:28.310> take

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
here and lay it flat then we take

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.539 
here and lay it flat then we take
several<00:01:28.759> lengths<00:01:29.209> of<00:01:29.329> masking<00:01:29.899> tape<00:01:30.109> and<00:01:30.549> we

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
several lengths of masking tape and we

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.629 
several lengths of masking tape and we
lay<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.060> across<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.109> final<00:01:33.409> drive<00:01:33.619> now<00:01:34.399> make

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
lay it across the final drive now make

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:37.059 
lay it across the final drive now make
sure<00:01:34.670> that's<00:01:34.999> nice<00:01:35.359> and<00:01:35.420> tight<00:01:35.779> and<00:01:36.349> that<00:01:36.920> you

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
sure that's nice and tight and that you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.239 
sure that's nice and tight and that you
have<00:01:37.219> no<00:01:37.369> flexor<00:01:38.179> play<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:39.259> tape<00:01:39.439> itself

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.789 

continue<00:01:43.249> adding<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.999> layers<00:01:44.409> now<00:01:45.409> when<00:01:45.619> you

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
continue adding the layers now when you

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.830 
continue adding the layers now when you
overlap<00:01:46.249> the<00:01:46.429> tape<00:01:46.579> make<00:01:47.179> sure<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:47.419> have<00:01:47.659> it

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
overlap the tape make sure you have it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.899 
overlap the tape make sure you have it
overlapping<00:01:48.200> by<00:01:48.439> at<00:01:48.560> least<00:01:48.770> about<00:01:49.459> a<00:01:49.520> half<00:01:49.759> an

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
overlapping by at least about a half an

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.529 
overlapping by at least about a half an
inch<00:01:49.969> or<00:01:50.209> so<00:01:50.709> that<00:01:51.709> gives<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.279> tape<00:01:52.549> when<00:01:53.419> it

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
inch or so that gives the tape when it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.379 
inch or so that gives the tape when it
bonds<00:01:53.810> together<00:01:53.990> some<00:01:54.979> more<00:01:55.219> rigidity<00:01:56.029> as

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
bonds together some more rigidity as

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.149 
bonds together some more rigidity as
well<00:01:56.779> as<00:01:56.869> strength<00:01:59.619> depending<00:02:00.619> on<00:02:00.739> the<00:02:00.829> final

need for the Sherman we should do

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.770 
need for the Sherman we should do
however<00:02:07.729> if<00:02:07.849> you're<00:02:07.969> doing<00:02:07.999> something<00:02:08.539> bigger

however if you're doing something bigger

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.870 
however if you're doing something bigger
like<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.080> tiger<00:02:09.500> or<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.679> king<00:02:09.890> tiger<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.670> might

like a tiger or a king tiger you might

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.950 
like a tiger or a king tiger you might
need<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.090> few<00:02:11.300> more<00:02:11.480> strips

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.790 
we need to trim the final Drive masking
so<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> fits<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.750> final<00:02:30.590> drive

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
so that it fits the final drive

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.120 
so that it fits the final drive
perfectly<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.200> take<00:02:33.410> our<00:02:33.650> snips

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
perfectly to do that we take our snips
