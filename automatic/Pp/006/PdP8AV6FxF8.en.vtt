00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.259
 6 euros spare parts security and 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.259
 Reliability presents 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.870
 hello friends welcome to the garage 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.480
 as always, it gives me great pleasure 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.730
 say hello today we have a very good 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.030
 program let's talk about the new mini 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.250
 cooper 2014 let's talk about the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.190
 volkswagen electric golf that what 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.769
 we drive in germany and we finish the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.580
 program with an interview with alfonso 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:08.420
 very real about the onstar system of 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.880
 general motors but let's start with mini 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.710
 last year at the end of last mini 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.030
 he made the launch of the new mini 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.010
 cooper 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.260
 internationally in the lounge of the 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.479
 angels and you could see it here 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.750
 in the garage but a few weeks ago 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.290
 the brand invited us to puerto rico to 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 drive the car there and obviously not 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.310
 it is the same to see the car to get on 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.560
 sit down for a while to handle it perceive 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.380
 all its characteristics in a way 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.159
 much closer as we did in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.729
 puerto rico- now the car changed as 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.770
 I told them on that occasion and it's 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.500
 as has happened here every year since 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.550
 year 2000 the mini was released in 1850 and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.250
 something 56-57 and it lasted the same until the year 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.170
 2000 was the same car practically in 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.020
 the year 2000 when we see double find 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.409
 the brand transforms it from the popular car 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.319
 British that was in a niche car and 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.480
 since then this is the third 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.640
 generation every time they are a little bit more 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.250
 big ones a little bit bigger 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 and obvious the purists say is that they no longer 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.270
 it's mini, it's not mini in the sense of 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.100
 mean a miniaturist but if it continues 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.310
 It is a car that is smaller than the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.570
 greater than the rival pardons of his 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.640
 segment and it's is mini in terms of the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.830
 design conception you do not see it and the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.440
 you recognize common and I can not imagine not 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.500
 does not have to have been easy for the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 designers do something new that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.720
 remember immediately that it is a mini and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.060
 look totally different would be 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.010
 practically impossible not then if 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.380
 It has different things but you have to 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.370
 look almost with a magnifying glass to understand the 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.840
 differences from one to the other 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.820
 mechanically however the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.400
 differences are stronger the car 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.800
 as I said it is a little bit wider 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.680
 Longest taller interior space 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.390
 improvement especially in the seats 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.580
 front of I feel a little bit more 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.110
 comfortable there's something more space behind 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.440
 there is also some more space in 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.600
 trunk but it is in the mechanics where the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.900
 auto is different no the platform is 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.069
 modified is more rigid 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.400
 a better job of the engineers of 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.099
 mwv domain as they want in the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.799
 soundproofing is to say the auto so 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.730
 less during the handling that we had in 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.439
 puerto rico was not so noisy I've 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.140
 criticized a lot here in the noises 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.450
 interiors of the mini puerto rico does not have 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.510
 streets as perfect as those of the USA 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.689
 are closer to ours and still 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.790
 in the potholes there etcetera we do not perceive 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.829
 the noises we hope that also to 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.739
 medium and long term so be the thing 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.049
 there are two engines for the mini one the one 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.040
 entrance of the mini cooper is a three 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.630
 cylinders in line with 136 horses and 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.210
 double turbo 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.800
 the two boxes for both models both 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.610
 versions open the mini cooper and the mini 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.000
 cooper s are manual or automatic the two 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.549
 six- speed 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.870
 the car is a little more comfortable than 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.640
 before 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.160
 grew so title the distance between 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.470
 axes and any increase ok of average 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.810
 inch is perceived in the quality of 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.230
 marching that is marching quality the car 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.750
 it is more comfortable less hard more planted at 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.630
 floor 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.110
 you do not lose however the essence of a 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.890
 nice agile car capable of doing 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.290
 curves very precisely where it points 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.940
 towards the car going that's still very 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.910
 all right 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.750
 but curiously when when 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:57.770
 We handled the mini cooper s we found 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.810
 that car is more comfortable than the mini 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.390
 normal cooper and if it's good but if the s 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.160
 is the sports one if instead of 132 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.070
 three-cylinder horses has four 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.120
 cylinders of 192 horses just like 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.729
 the other also has a twin 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.600
 because it's more comfortable because of a suspension 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.449
 which is adjustable has a suspension 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.760
 that adapts to the handling of the vehicle and 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.440
 It can be more rigid or more comfortable 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.050
 depending on factors such as 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.080
 speed the pressure on the accelerator 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.790
 the inclination of the body in order 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.460
 in the position of the steering wheel 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.220
 all those parameters are read by the 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.530
 computer that adjusts the suspension 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.780
 for those the details of the car is going to 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.030
 be 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.030
 is going to start selling in Mexico on the 15th 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.040
 April and its prices for the price of 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.760
 entry version of the mini cooper 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.500
 normal is 279 thousand pesos and the mini 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.540
 cooper s is 340 thousand pesos yet 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.160
 and publish social networks immediately 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.960
 with the price can spread many people 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.260
 Cheap bet is less than what 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.169
 I thought you have to understand that the mini 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.900
 they are extremely customizable cars 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.050
 and those prices are imprisoned without even a 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.090
 optional every little thing you 're going to go 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.280
 increasing the price even in a way 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.350
 geometric in some cases is that I 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.600
 like with the most expensive white ceiling is 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.580
 that I like with the wheels so lighter 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.030
 is that I like it with more leather seats 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.080
 Of course I prefer that more expensive stereo all 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:37.150
 what you want is a little bit different there 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.650
 will be if you want a mini that costs 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.260
 279,000 and a mini cooper that costs 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.969
 340 you are going to have the very very very version 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.949
 very very basic 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.399
 Anyway, I think you're going to have a 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:51.829
 self that is better than the one that replaces and 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:55.489
 we can not always say that we go 

00:06:51.829 --> 00:07:00.759
 now a cut and return from 

00:06:55.489 --> 00:07:00.759
