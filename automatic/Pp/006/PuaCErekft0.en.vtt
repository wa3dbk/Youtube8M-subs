Section two wings a little top part for

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.800 
Section two wings a little top part for
the<00:01:35.100> top<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> head<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.690> little

the top of the head and just a little

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
the top of the head and just a little
triangle<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> beak<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.369> you'll<00:01:39.119> need<00:01:39.330> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
triangle for the beak and you'll need a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
triangle for the beak and you'll need a
one<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> half<00:01:40.049> inch<00:01:40.409> styrofoam<00:01:41.220> ball<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
one and a half inch styrofoam ball to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.660 
one and a half inch styrofoam ball to
prepare<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.659> tail<00:01:42.900> section<00:01:43.259> make<00:01:44.250> three

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
prepare the tail section make three

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.410 
prepare the tail section make three
petals<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.560> glue<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
petals and then glue them so that this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
petals and then glue them so that this
one<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.080> not<00:01:49.440> quite<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> half<00:01:50.729> an

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
one is not quite this about a half an

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.620 
one is not quite this about a half an
inch<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.330> from<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.590> end<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:54.000> sticks<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
inch out from the end so it sticks out a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
inch out from the end so it sticks out a
little<00:01:54.780> further<00:01:55.049> wing<00:01:55.500> section<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
little further wing section is just a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.990 
little further wing section is just a
regular<00:01:56.850> petal<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.190> top<00:01:59.490> part

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
regular petal and this little top part

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.410 
regular petal and this little top part
for<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> top<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> head<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.009> cut<00:02:02.789> one<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
for the top of the head I cut one of the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
for the top of the head I cut one of the
strips<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.990> half<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
strips in half and then this is a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
strips in half and then this is a
quarter<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.390> an<00:02:06.479> inch<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.259> smallest<00:02:07.649> sections

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
quarter of an inch the smallest sections

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
quarter of an inch the smallest sections
on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> sides<00:02:08.970> measured<00:02:09.509> about<00:02:09.720> an<00:02:09.840> inch<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
on the sides measured about an inch so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.250 
on the sides measured about an inch so
just<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.370> started<00:02:11.970> folding<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.840> just

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
just I just started folding it and just

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.309 
just I just started folding it and just
arranged<00:02:14.040> them<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.540> center<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.110> was

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
arranged them so that the center one was

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.710 
arranged them so that the center one was
a<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.560> bit<00:02:16.769> longer<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.910> start<00:02:18.239> your

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
a little bit longer but to start your

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.259 
a little bit longer but to start your
project<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.709> usually<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> put<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.000> tail

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
project I usually like to put the tail

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.400 
project I usually like to put the tail
in<00:02:21.540> first<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.910> nursery<00:02:23.910> anywhere<00:02:24.720> along<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
in first so nursery anywhere along the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.890 
in first so nursery anywhere along the
back<00:02:25.620> where<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> think<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.340> back<00:02:26.550> should<00:02:26.790> be

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
back where I think the back should be

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.800 
back where I think the back should be
just<00:02:27.900> take<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> knife<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.300> open<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
just take a knife and open up to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.590 
just take a knife and open up to
accommodate<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.709> tail<00:02:32.209> assemble<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.300> first

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
accommodate the tail assemble it first

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.509 
accommodate the tail assemble it first
and<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.290> take<00:02:34.530> them<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:35.130> put

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
and then you can take them out and put

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.300 
and then you can take them out and put
some<00:02:35.730> glue<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.209> there<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> that's<00:02:37.799> going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.160> be

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
some glue in there so that's going to be

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.980 
some glue in there so that's going to be
the<00:02:38.459> tail<00:02:38.640> section

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.950 

okay<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:45.920> if<00:02:46.280> tails<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> two<00:02:47.690> wings

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
okay so if tails in and the two wings

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.190 
okay so if tails in and the two wings
are<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.490> directly<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.180> front<00:02:50.510> off<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.960> tail

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
are on so directly in front off the tail

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.720 
are on so directly in front off the tail
you're<00:02:51.530> going<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.860> put<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.160> little<00:02:52.370> opening

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
you're going to put the little opening

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.420 
you're going to put the little opening
for<00:02:53.000> your<00:02:53.570> little<00:02:53.780> triangle<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.770> beak<00:02:55.040> so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
for your little triangle for the beak so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.760 
for your little triangle for the beak so
you're<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.120> make<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.330> little<00:02:56.720> slit

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.980 

and<00:03:00.770> insert<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.790> little<00:03:01.970> triangle<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
and insert the little triangle for the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.950 
and insert the little triangle for the
beak<00:03:03.230> go<00:03:04.070> directly<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:04.790> line<00:03:05.030> two<00:03:05.510> with<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
beak go directly in line two with the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.930 
beak go directly in line two with the
wings<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:07.190> going<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.490> make<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.670> little

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
wings just going to make a little

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.010 
wings just going to make a little
opening<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:10.250> then<00:03:11.030> we're<00:03:11.210> going<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.510> put<00:03:11.840> our
