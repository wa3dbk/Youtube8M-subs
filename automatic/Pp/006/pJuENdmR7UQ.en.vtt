00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.090
 self- perception 121 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.800
 and today we have a duel between a tank and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.880
 Street and German tanks 8th level 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.970
 VK4502 aus and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 and what the game called alpha slippers that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.230
 concerns the technical characteristics of the tank 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 is-3 then all this you can find and in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.330
 a previous release link to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 which you should see below and what 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.309
 As for the German tank, I now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 I'll tell you all about him 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.339
 German tank dynamics are pretty 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.470
 good tank accelerates well 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:46.500
 maintains speed 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:51.059
 that this is one of the most dynamic tanks 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.860
 heavy tanks level 8 reservation 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.040
 tank is 100 millimeters frontal 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.400
 parts of the tower and 120 millimeters in the hull 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.680
 airborne 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.460
 and aft armor of all other parts 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.740
 the tank is 80 millimeters what 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.400
 is not good well and not bad 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.400
 an indicator 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.979
 guns have good penetrability 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.490
 good damage any straight 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.330
 rate of fire good accuracy 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.330
 let's see a duel 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.930
 as you see I take a position again for 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:35.049
 fountain as always this time we 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.710
 splitting the damage I shoot 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.009
 the enemy on our damage to them he punches 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.470
 me as you see the shot hit in 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.970
 my opponent's pickups are very 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:53.920
 lucky at speed but difficult to evict 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.020
 This place on the tank with such 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.909
 distances since the coruche cannon 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.929
 recharged faster then he will have to 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.929
 crawl on us 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:13.280
 to compensate for the lack of armor 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.210
 he will have to come to the butt that is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.210
 become clinch 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.470
 so I could not dominate the bottom 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 Bronelist in this case, I have to 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.750
 either the top armor sheet that can 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.950
 still punch or see here 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.819
 turrets on a tank which is very good 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.819
 shot off 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.560
 since the doctor then finds the instrument 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.070
 fixed above, it will be easier for him 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.440
 vyselivat here this leaf on the tower 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.190
 which as I used to say in all 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.570
 releases well makes its way so me 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.630
 will have to move away from the enemy a little 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.580
 at an angle and keep the tower so that it 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.320
 it was difficult for this goal to be sad 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.740
 shells fell here in this part of the tank or 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.520
 bounce 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.520
 I'm going back 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.640
 receiving damage he punches me like 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.740
 see here 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.700
 mark left with a bang went here in 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.010
 I do not break through this sheet 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.010
 the valley begin to walk to the sides 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.390
 not giving the enemy the opportunity to shoot 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.300
 in this hatch 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.300
 but still shot at me 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.400
 i punch him 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.150
 notices to walk to the sides so I start 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.900
 courtyard slightly tower stronger 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.900
 1 and he misses 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.720
 i punch 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.020
 as you can see all go through the top 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.020
 bronelist 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.359
 what we see the enemy is left only 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.060
 only 282 hp we have 500 i.e. one third 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:06.340
 principle the enemy can destroy us two 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.340
 shots we beat off with 1 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.180
 I turned the tower the enemy did not break 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.430
 and ending the door 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.500
