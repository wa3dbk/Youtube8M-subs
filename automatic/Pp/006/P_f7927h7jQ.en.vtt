pellet<00:00:50.900> basket<00:00:52.329> revision<00:00:54.519> 2.1<00:00:56.860> first<00:00:57.860> let's

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
pellet basket revision 2.1 first let's

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.790 
pellet basket revision 2.1 first let's
take<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.339> look<00:00:58.430> at<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.089> pellet<00:00:59.780> basket<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:00.530> I

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
take a look at the pellet basket that I

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.270 
take a look at the pellet basket that I
made<00:01:01.250> originally<00:01:01.909> this<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.350> first

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
made originally this is the first

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.300 
made originally this is the first
prototype<00:01:05.200> proof-of-concept<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:07.009> works

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
prototype proof-of-concept it works

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.800 
prototype proof-of-concept it works
surprisingly<00:01:07.520> well

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
surprisingly well

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.560 
surprisingly well
I<00:01:08.840> actually<00:01:09.410> got<00:01:09.680> eight<00:01:10.280> or<00:01:10.550> nine<00:01:10.880> burns<00:01:11.330> out

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
I actually got eight or nine burns out

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.540 
I actually got eight or nine burns out
of<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:11.990> was<00:01:12.140> surprised<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.039> get<00:01:13.160> two<00:01:13.399> or

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
of this I was surprised to get two or

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.279 
of this I was surprised to get two or
three<00:01:13.580> burns<00:01:14.090> out<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:17.050> this<00:01:18.050> was<00:01:18.259> a

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
three burns out of this so this was a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.790 
three burns out of this so this was a
very<00:01:18.380> good<00:01:18.850> proof-of-concept<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.750> allowed<00:01:21.590> me

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
very good proof-of-concept it allowed me

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.700 
very good proof-of-concept it allowed me
to<00:01:21.830> learn<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.340> lot<00:01:22.610> about<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.270> way<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.750> rocket

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
to learn a lot about the way the rocket

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.469 
to learn a lot about the way the rocket
stove<00:01:24.890> behaves<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.640> fire<00:01:25.850> box<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.330> how<00:01:26.420> to

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
stove behaves in the fire box and how to

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.680 
stove behaves in the fire box and how to
adapt<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:27.170> pellet<00:01:27.560> basket<00:01:28.399> or<00:01:28.759> how<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.270> adapt

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
adapt a pellet basket or how to adapt

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.230 
adapt a pellet basket or how to adapt
pellets<00:01:30.229> as<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.440> fuel<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.700> rocket<00:01:32.030> stove

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
pellets as a fuel for the rocket stove

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.469 
pellets as a fuel for the rocket stove
to<00:01:32.539> work<00:01:32.720> very<00:01:33.080> very<00:01:33.170> well<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:35.210> next

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
to work very very well and this next

picture I have not removed any of the
lower<00:01:52.399> sections<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:54.320> when<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.590> did<00:01:55.070> cut<00:01:55.460> those

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
lower sections but when I did cut those

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.060 
lower sections but when I did cut those
sections<00:01:56.180> away<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.810> try<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.530> with<00:01:57.860> the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
sections away and try just with the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.700 
sections away and try just with the
removed<00:01:58.460> sections<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.360> ended<00:02:00.290> up<00:02:00.380> pouring

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
removed sections I ended up pouring

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.530 
removed sections I ended up pouring
pellets<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.490> they<00:02:01.579> poured<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.240> through

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
pellets in and they poured right through

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.350 
pellets in and they poured right through
it<00:02:02.719> was<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> miserable<00:02:03.170> failure<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:04.579> across<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
it was a miserable failure so across the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.009 
it was a miserable failure so across the
center<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:07.299> basket<00:02:08.299> at<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.509> very<00:02:08.810> bottom

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
center of the basket at the very bottom

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.430 
center of the basket at the very bottom
I<00:02:09.410> ran<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.009> well<00:02:10.369> tack<00:02:10.880> welded<00:02:11.390> another<00:02:11.750> rod

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
I ran and well tack welded another rod

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.850 
I ran and well tack welded another rod
going<00:02:12.769> across<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.390> gave<00:02:14.630> me<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.930> exact

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
going across and this gave me the exact

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.699 
going across and this gave me the exact
opening<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.549> I<00:02:16.640> was<00:02:16.790> looking<00:02:17.120> for<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:18.049> now

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
opening that I was looking for that now

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.600 
opening that I was looking for that now
allows<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.610> pellets<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.620> stay<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.130> basket

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
allows the pellets to stay in the basket

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.500 
allows the pellets to stay in the basket
but<00:02:22.880> as<00:02:23.120> soon<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.660> they<00:02:24.049> become<00:02:25.180> very<00:02:26.180> hot

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
but as soon as they become very hot

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.170 
but as soon as they become very hot
embers<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.170> start<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.680> shrink<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:28.340> size<00:02:28.370> they

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
embers and start to shrink in size they

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.569 
embers and start to shrink in size they
fall<00:02:29.510> through<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.109> get<00:02:30.440> sucked<00:02:30.709> into<00:02:30.980> the

that<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.860> now<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> couple<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.820> resistors

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090

just sort of tacked soldered on to the
printed<00:02:59.940> circuit<00:03:00.120> board<00:03:00.300> because<00:03:01.140> I've<00:03:01.290> been

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
printed circuit board because I've been

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.800 
printed circuit board because I've been
adjusting<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.490> intervals<00:03:03.060> my<00:03:03.540> time

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
adjusting the time intervals my time

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.140 
adjusting the time intervals my time
interval<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.350> now<00:03:04.560> about<00:03:05.310> one<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> half

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
interval is now about one and a half

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.650 
interval is now about one and a half
seconds<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.580> two<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> half<00:03:09.000> minutes<00:03:09.450> in

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660

between intervals

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.690 
between intervals
I<00:03:11.390> found<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.660> yes<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.650> necessary<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.280> shake

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
I found that yes it's necessary to shake

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.090 
I found that yes it's necessary to shake
my<00:03:15.000> my<00:03:15.690> pellet<00:03:15.990> hopper<00:03:16.410> every<00:03:16.650> now<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.010> then

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
my my pellet hopper every now and then

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.250 
my my pellet hopper every now and then
no<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:17.910> not<00:03:18.060> necessary<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.660> shake<00:03:18.960> it<00:03:19.110> for

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
no it's not necessary to shake it for

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.410 
no it's not necessary to shake it for
very<00:03:19.440> long<00:03:19.500> because<00:03:19.950> while<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.580> can<00:03:21.150> shake

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
very long because while you can shake

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.450 
very long because while you can shake
them<00:03:21.630> loose<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.140> can<00:03:22.410> also<00:03:22.680> shake<00:03:23.070> them<00:03:23.250> too

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
them loose you can also shake them too

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.960 
them loose you can also shake them too
long<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.940> compact<00:03:24.930> them<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.590> end<00:03:26.190> up<00:03:26.400> jamming

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
long and compact them and end up jamming

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.660 
long and compact them and end up jamming
the<00:03:27.090> pellets<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.780> tube<00:03:28.130> by<00:03:29.130> shaking<00:03:29.430> it

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the pellets in the tube by shaking it

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.980 
the pellets in the tube by shaking it
too<00:03:29.880> much<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:32.580> time<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.480> agitator

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
too much so the the time to agitator

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.700 
too much so the the time to agitator
works<00:03:34.650> extremely<00:03:35.160> well<00:03:35.460> it<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.630> complete<00:03:37.380> and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
works extremely well it is complete and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.370 
works extremely well it is complete and
the<00:03:38.580> only<00:03:38.730> other<00:03:38.880> thing<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.300> may<00:03:39.570> do<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.110> I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the only other thing that I may do is I

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.130 
the only other thing that I may do is I
may<00:03:40.560> still<00:03:40.920> replace<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:42.000> down<00:03:42.330> tube<00:03:42.690> here

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
may still replace this down tube here

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.699 
may still replace this down tube here
with<00:03:43.650> something<00:03:44.160> clear<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.900> I'm<00:03:45.990> not<00:03:46.200> sure<00:03:46.470> it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
with something clear and I'm not sure it

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.670 
with something clear and I'm not sure it
doesn't<00:03:47.100> get<00:03:47.250> very<00:03:47.280> warm<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.270> side<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.260> I

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
doesn't get very warm on the side so I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.400 
doesn't get very warm on the side so I
may<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.459> away<00:03:50.580> with<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:50.970> plastic<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:51.959> I'll

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
may get away with a plastic if I do I'll

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.160 
may get away with a plastic if I do I'll
put<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.980> pellet<00:03:53.550> hopper<00:03:53.970> further<00:03:54.690> away<00:03:55.110> to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
put the pellet hopper further away to

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.680 
put the pellet hopper further away to
this<00:03:55.620> side<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.850> comes<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.330> at<00:03:57.540> an

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
this side so that it comes in at an

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.480 
this side so that it comes in at an
angle<00:03:57.840> toward<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.620> stove<00:03:58.920> rather<00:03:59.220> than

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
angle toward the stove rather than

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.930 
angle toward the stove rather than
beside<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.120> stove<00:04:00.360> just<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.530> prevent<00:04:02.340> any<00:04:02.550> any

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
beside the stove just to prevent any any

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.840 
beside the stove just to prevent any any
heat<00:04:03.330> from<00:04:06.260> affecting<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.650> tube<00:04:07.890> but<00:04:08.610> yeah

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
heat from affecting the tube but yeah

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.979 
heat from affecting the tube but yeah
that's<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:10.550> last<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:11.880> want<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.120> show<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
that's it last I want to show you the

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.310 
that's it last I want to show you the
baffle<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.040> I've<00:04:14.580> created<00:04:14.850> for<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.870> firebox

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
baffle that I've created for the firebox

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.050 
baffle that I've created for the firebox
this<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:17.609> baffle<00:04:18.120> right<00:04:18.270> here<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:20.030> what<00:04:21.030> I

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
this this baffle right here is what I

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.670 
this this baffle right here is what I
use<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.390> control<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.989> airflow<00:04:22.700> inside<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
use to control the airflow inside the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.210 
use to control the airflow inside the
inside<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.940> firebox<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:28.440> use<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.010> to

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
inside the firebox and I use this to

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.720 
inside the firebox and I use this to
bring<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.550> stove<00:04:30.000> up<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.450> temperature<00:04:30.900> and

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
bring the stove up to temperature and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.010 
bring the stove up to temperature and
once<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.940> stove<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.330> up<00:04:33.480> to<00:04:33.600> temperature<00:04:33.750> I

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
once the stove is up to temperature I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.870 
once the stove is up to temperature I
can<00:04:34.230> remove<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.650> completely<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.340> that's<00:04:35.700> when

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
can remove it completely and that's when

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.520 
can remove it completely and that's when
it<00:04:36.000> really<00:04:36.030> takes<00:04:36.510> off<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.080> reach<00:04:37.380> a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
it really takes off so you reach a

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.950 
it really takes off so you reach a
threshold<00:04:37.800> temperature<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.880> right<00:04:39.360> now<00:04:39.540> what

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
threshold temperature and right now what

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.040 
threshold temperature and right now what
am<00:04:40.050> i<00:04:40.140> running<00:04:40.320> at

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.589 

617<00:04:45.050> degrees<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.740> can<00:04:46.340> probably<00:04:46.699> remove<00:04:47.360> this

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
617 degrees I can probably remove this

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.600 
617 degrees I can probably remove this
altogether<00:04:48.020> at<00:04:48.379> this<00:04:48.530> point<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:51.039> then<00:04:52.039> just

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
altogether at this point and then just

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.459 
altogether at this point and then just
let<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:52.819> stove<00:04:53.210> continue<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
let the stove continue and the

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.350 
let the stove continue and the
temperature<00:04:54.889> will<00:04:55.009> continue<00:04:55.189> to<00:04:55.580> rise<00:04:55.759> and<00:04:56.120> it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
temperature will continue to rise and it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.350 
temperature will continue to rise and it
will<00:04:56.479> eventually<00:04:56.719> hit<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.430> run<00:04:58.430> at<00:04:58.669> 800

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
will eventually hit and run at 800

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.719 
will eventually hit and run at 800
degrees<00:04:59.659> I've<00:05:00.289> also<00:05:00.530> put<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:01.009> handle<00:05:01.430> on<00:05:01.580> the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
degrees I've also put a handle on the

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.469 
degrees I've also put a handle on the
top<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.330> basket<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:04.400> can<00:05:05.000> grip<00:05:05.240> the

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
top of the basket that I can grip the

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.570 
top of the basket that I can grip the
basket<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.199> slide<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.680> back<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:06.919> forth<00:05:07.159> in

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
basket and slide it back and forth in

back closest to the tank all the way
back<00:05:17.060> as<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.389> was<00:05:17.509> saying<00:05:17.750> all<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.289> way<00:05:18.379> back

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
back as I was saying all the way back

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.219 
back as I was saying all the way back
closest<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.669> tank<00:05:19.909> is<00:05:20.120> where<00:05:20.689> I<00:05:20.719> get<00:05:21.020> the

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
closest to the tank is where I get the

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.320 
closest to the tank is where I get the
the<00:05:21.590> most<00:05:21.919> amount<00:05:22.219> of<00:05:22.370> heat<00:05:22.430> because<00:05:22.819> all<00:05:23.180> of

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
the most amount of heat because all of

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.640 
the most amount of heat because all of
the<00:05:23.419> air<00:05:23.569> is<00:05:23.750> passing<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:24.289> front<00:05:24.529> of<00:05:24.590> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
the air is passing in front of the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.309 
the air is passing in front of the
basket<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.159> underneath<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.819> basket<00:05:25.969> and<00:05:26.479> if

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
basket and underneath the basket and if

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.140 
basket and underneath the basket and if
I<00:05:27.500> take<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.949> slide<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.490> towards<00:05:28.699> the<00:05:28.909> front

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
I take and slide it towards the front

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.629 
I take and slide it towards the front
away<00:05:30.110> from<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:30.469> tank<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.979> can<00:05:31.430> actually

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
away from the tank I can actually

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.420 
away from the tank I can actually
regulate<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.750> flow<00:05:33.020> of<00:05:33.050> air<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:34.250> behind

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
regulate the flow of air going behind

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.629 
regulate the flow of air going behind
the<00:05:34.789> basket<00:05:34.939> and<00:05:35.479> that<00:05:36.469> actually<00:05:36.949> causes<00:05:37.400> the

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
the basket and that actually causes the

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.689 
the basket and that actually causes the
temperature<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.509> drop<00:05:38.810> so<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.529> now<00:05:39.830> have<00:05:39.860> not

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
temperature to drop so I now have not

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.430 
temperature to drop so I now have not
only<00:05:40.939> of<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.740> super<00:05:42.789> hot<00:05:43.789> burn<00:05:44.330> hotter<00:05:44.840> than<00:05:45.139> any

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
only of a super hot burn hotter than any

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.559 
only of a super hot burn hotter than any
wood<00:05:45.979> that<00:05:46.310> I've<00:05:46.430> ever<00:05:46.580> burned<00:05:46.940> in<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.270> stove

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
wood that I've ever burned in the stove

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.709 
wood that I've ever burned in the stove
but<00:05:48.139> also<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.919> have<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.669> ability<00:05:49.759> to<00:05:50.360> regulate

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
but also I have the ability to regulate

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.350 
but also I have the ability to regulate
the<00:05:51.139> flow<00:05:51.440> or<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.770> regulate<00:05:52.759> the<00:05:52.879> temperature

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
the flow or the regulate the temperature

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.360 
the flow or the regulate the temperature
of<00:05:53.569> the<00:05:53.750> stove<00:05:54.020> simply<00:05:54.680> by<00:05:54.830> shifting<00:05:54.889> the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
of the stove simply by shifting the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.180 
of the stove simply by shifting the
basket<00:05:55.849> front<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.240> back<00:05:56.710> so<00:05:57.710> that's<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.039> for

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
basket front to back so that's it for

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.879 
basket front to back so that's it for
now

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
now

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.379 
now
like<00:06:00.889> I<00:06:01.009> said<00:06:01.190> they're<00:06:01.339> very<00:06:01.669> little<00:06:01.940> I<00:06:02.060> have

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
like I said they're very little I have

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.369 
like I said they're very little I have
left<00:06:02.629> to<00:06:02.900> do<00:06:03.080> on<00:06:03.259> the<00:06:03.379> rocket<00:06:03.740> stove<00:06:05.379> other

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
left to do on the rocket stove other

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.740 
left to do on the rocket stove other
than<00:06:06.650> enjoy<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:07.310> and<00:06:07.490> continue<00:06:08.389> with<00:06:08.539> some<00:06:08.659> of
