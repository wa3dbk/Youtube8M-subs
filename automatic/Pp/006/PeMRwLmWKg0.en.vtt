cheated okay that's when I cheated on
games<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.060> mean<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.280> seems<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.759> pointless

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
games I mean it just seems so pointless

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.310 
games I mean it just seems so pointless
like<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> sort<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:39.960> i<00:01:40.259> would

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
like that's the sort of thing i would

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830 
like that's the sort of thing i would
expect<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.100> fifth<00:01:41.549> grader<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.509> i

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
expect like a fifth grader to do and i

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.569 
expect like a fifth grader to do and i
know<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
know a lot of you which are a lot of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.069 
know a lot of you which are a lot of
your<00:01:44.790> older<00:01:45.149> than<00:01:45.270> fifth<00:01:45.509> grade<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:45.930> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
your older than fifth grade but it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020 
your older than fifth grade but it
really<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.500> shows<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> maturity<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.670> mean

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
really just shows the maturity I mean

really just shows the maturity I mean
sort<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> material<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:49.200> dealing<00:01:49.470> with

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
sort of material I'm dealing with

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
sort of material I'm dealing with
dealing<00:01:50.189> with<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.549> now<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.970> hearing<00:01:51.780> the

dealing with right now and hearing the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
dealing with right now and hearing the
logic<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.920> hackers<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> mean<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
logic so some of you hackers I mean is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
logic so some of you hackers I mean is
it<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.540> pretty<00:01:54.840> funny<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.030> mean

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
what's the point of hacking all together

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.710 
what's the point of hacking all together
on<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.649> meet<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.979> most<00:02:08.520> hackers<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.569> ask

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
on you meet you most hackers if you ask

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
on you meet you most hackers if you ask
them<00:02:09.959> why<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> hack<00:02:10.470> they're<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.920> oh<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
them why the hack they're like oh so it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.840 
them why the hack they're like oh so it
can<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.819> killed

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
can get killed

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.330 
can get killed
it<00:02:13.090> kills<00:02:13.420> easier<00:02:13.840> well<00:02:14.140> let<00:02:14.590> me<00:02:14.680> tend<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
it kills easier well let me tend the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.670 
it kills easier well let me tend the
bigger<00:02:15.700> question<00:02:16.090> ask<00:02:16.270> what<00:02:16.960> value<00:02:17.500> does<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
bigger question ask what value does a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.980 
bigger question ask what value does a
kill<00:02:17.980> half<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.580> didn't<00:02:18.820> earn<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.330> vol

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
kill half if you didn't earn it the vol

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.140 
kill half if you didn't earn it the vol
until<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.980> obvious<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.550> don't<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.850> money
