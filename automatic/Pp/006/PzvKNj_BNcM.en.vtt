00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.760
 especially in the cold season 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 the work with bars and kavala thiess 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.710
 a welcome change for horse 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.960
 and rider but also the whole training 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 can work with the rods supported 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.519
 and to be improved 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.329
 we give together with 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 horse industry champion Wehrer long 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:36.030
 tips and tricks for a successful 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.130
 We want to start with pole training 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.740
 the first contact and with the exercises 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.960
 for the step 3 tv team leader 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.610
 steffi and her voice join in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.550
 single lying on the ground 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.780
 rods are still familiar to them 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.780
 not be exceeded 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.170
 then we would like to see you next 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.059
 paced the die steffi sometimes on the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.290
 Stange over it, I roll the roll 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.910
 rod on the side something 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.250
 to give him a bit of a break too 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.210
 show and the alternative way 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.010
 narrow 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 also very good if that's the case 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.970
 long reins is this really a 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 chance once had to look out there myself 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.260
 to take care of his feet too 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.460
 he makes so wonderful because he needs 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.530
 now not in any way 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.149
 somehow to relieve the back he 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 You have to be prepared if it is 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.750
 really a wild horse is the can 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.100
 then sometimes not so easy 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.479
 in step over it but give 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.729
 maybe make a small sentence 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.649
 he had to keep it there as well 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.619
 be caught that the trains possibly 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.329
 not so very long 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.850
 these labor contracts with a can 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.979
 purity of aisles support 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.659
 he has the one or the other step 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.179
 others still have some problems 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.920
 with the fashion serenity therefore lay 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.630
 Let's stick this two here 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.819
 pretend that the clock tomorrow, however 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.829
 not allowing him to step over with each step 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.520
 a pole must go but one 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.530
 intermediate step has the right measure 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.090
 aimed to find between the bars 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.519
 especially after the size of one 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.799
 horses usually should be in the 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.970
 Step the bars about 80 centimeters 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.040
 apart 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.890
 who can judge bad is the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.650
 take your own feet to help 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.230
 4 foot lengths with a shoe size of 39 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.769
 to 40 correspond to a step of 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.769
 horse 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.910
 it is necessary to have a nice horse 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 hardworking allowed to go but leaves him 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.310
 then just a little bit the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 Possibility is there to look 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.580
 especially for horses that tend to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.710
 passat I go or unclean 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.150
 The poles can be in step by step 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.980
 work to a clean and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 help us to take a step-by-step approach 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.959
 Eventual with his horse 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.709
 Difficulties that it really is 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.090
 Let's start using the back 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.720
 You can also go over a higher one 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.640
 asked scality step riding 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.370
 that you really have your feet 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 Angling and getting this movement 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.590
 Legs into the agility in the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.510
 back continues and that's a good thing 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.160
 that you ride on the long rein or 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.000
 almost given up for the horse to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.000
 watch yourself 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.590
 The exercises in the step can be two to 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.700
 training three times a week 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.489
 to be built in 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.349
 important is always with a positive 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.349
 experience to finish the exercise
