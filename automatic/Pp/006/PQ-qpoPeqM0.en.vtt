00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
your wheel off and you're gonna check

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.670 
your wheel off and you're gonna check
the<00:00:17.820> tire<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.270> make<00:00:19.020> sure<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.289> there<00:00:19.470> aren't

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the tire and make sure that there aren't

any<00:00:19.800> punctures<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.699> tire<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:21.960> around

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
any punctures and tire so just go around

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.950 
any punctures and tire so just go around
the<00:00:22.470> tire<00:00:23.420> checking<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.660> there's<00:00:24.840> any

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960

glass or metal especially in New York
City<00:00:27.599> you'll<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.369> tons<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.519> glass<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.330> may

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
City you'll see tons of glass that may

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.760 
City you'll see tons of glass that may
be<00:00:31.130> protruding<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.520> tire<00:00:33.260> then<00:00:34.260> if

you don't see any glass what you're

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.910 
you don't see any glass what you're
gonna<00:00:36.450> want<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.870> you're<00:00:36.960> gonna<00:00:37.079> wanna

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
gonna want to do is you're gonna wanna

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.889 
gonna want to do is you're gonna wanna
take<00:00:38.129> off<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.399> tire

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.930 

exposing<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.079> tube<00:00:48.260> inside

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.730 

now<00:00:54.940> once<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.180> have<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.330> tube<00:00:55.510> out<00:00:55.680> you'll<00:00:56.680> be

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
now once you have the tube out you'll be

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.820 
now once you have the tube out you'll be
able<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:57.010> see<00:00:57.130> more<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.000> what<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.800> the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
able to see more of what the what the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.090 
able to see more of what the what the
flat<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.220> all<00:01:00.340> about<00:01:00.550> so<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.320> -<00:01:02.320> we're<00:01:02.980> gonna

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
flat is all about so this - we're gonna

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.750 
flat is all about so this - we're gonna
take<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.310> pump<00:01:08.580> pump<00:01:09.580> up<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> tube<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.700> try<00:01:12.700> to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
take a pump pump up the tube and try to

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.110 
take a pump pump up the tube and try to
find<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.060> puncture

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.190 

so<00:01:21.120> it<00:01:21.180> looks<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> small<00:01:21.960> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so it looks like there's a small little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.680 
so it looks like there's a small little
hole<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.980> tube<00:01:23.190> so<00:01:24.000> usually<00:01:24.300> what<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
hole in the tube so usually what that is

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.390 
hole in the tube so usually what that is
is<00:01:24.870> something<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.560> went<00:01:25.980> through<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.190> tyre

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
is something that went through the tyre

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730 
is something that went through the tyre
so<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> check<00:01:27.750> around<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.290> tire<00:01:28.500> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
so you want to check around the tire on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.500 
so you want to check around the tire on
the<00:01:29.190> inside<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:30.090> may<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.240> something

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
the inside there may be something

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.660 
the inside there may be something
embedded<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.470> actual<00:01:31.770> tire<00:01:31.980> like<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> piece

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
embedded in the actual tire like a piece

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.330 
embedded in the actual tire like a piece
of<00:01:32.700> glass<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.300> very<00:01:33.420> careful<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.050> uh

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
of glass just be very careful not to uh

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.310 
of glass just be very careful not to uh
to<00:01:35.340> cut<00:01:35.550> your<00:01:35.670> fingers

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
to cut your fingers

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
to cut your fingers
another<00:01:37.320> type<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.530> flat<00:01:38.540> demonstrated<00:01:39.540> in

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
another type of flat demonstrated in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.280 
another type of flat demonstrated in
this<00:01:39.690> tube<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:42.090> pinch<00:01:42.720> flat<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
this tube here is a pinch flat and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.860 
this tube here is a pinch flat and
basically<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.100> means<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:47.870> didn't

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
basically what that means is you didn't

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.359 
basically what that means is you didn't
have<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.080> tire<00:01:49.350> inflated<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> proper

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
have your tire inflated to the proper

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.910 
have your tire inflated to the proper
pressure<00:01:50.580> which<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.150> always<00:01:51.800> labeled<00:01:52.800> right

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
pressure which is always labeled right

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.170 
pressure which is always labeled right
on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> side<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> tire<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> sidewall

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
on the side of the tire on the sidewall

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.820 
on the side of the tire on the sidewall
so<00:01:54.720> it'll<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.050> something<00:01:55.080> between<00:01:55.650> like

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
so it'll say something between like

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.030 
so it'll say something between like
maybe<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.130> 40<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:57.090> 60<00:01:57.420> psi<00:01:57.570> or<00:01:58.170> 80<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.590> 100<00:01:58.920> psi

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
maybe like 40 to 60 psi or 80 to 100 psi

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
maybe like 40 to 60 psi or 80 to 100 psi
you<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> make<00:02:00.270> sure<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you want to make sure that you have it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.830 
you want to make sure that you have it
up<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.080> this<00:02:01.170> specific<00:02:02.010> psi<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:03.240> else<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.750> will

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
up to this specific psi or else you will

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.320 
up to this specific psi or else you will
get<00:02:04.340> something<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.580> called<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:05.910> pinch<00:02:06.090> flat

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
get something that's called a pinch flat

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.389 
get something that's called a pinch flat
which<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.710> right<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.740> you'll<00:02:08.040> see<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.310> looks

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
which is right here you'll see it looks

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.109 
which is right here you'll see it looks
like<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.610> snakebite

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like a snakebite

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
like a snakebite
and<00:02:09.300> what<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.200> means<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> tire<00:02:10.920> actually

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and what that means is the tire actually

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.480 
and what that means is the tire actually
pushes<00:02:11.670> against<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.709> rim<00:02:13.709> when<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:14.370> over

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
pushes against the rim when you go over

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.110 
pushes against the rim when you go over
something<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> pothole<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> rock

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
something like a pothole or a rock

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.060 
something like a pothole or a rock
another<00:02:18.120> type<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.450> flat<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.810> called<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.709> blowout

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
another type of flat is called a blowout

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.130 
another type of flat is called a blowout
and<00:02:20.340> basically<00:02:20.880> what<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.150> happen<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.660> if

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and basically what will happen is if

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.210 
and basically what will happen is if
your<00:02:22.230> tires<00:02:22.470> not<00:02:22.680> seated<00:02:22.980> correctly

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
your tires not seated correctly

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.800 
your tires not seated correctly
basically<00:02:23.850> meaning<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> tire<00:02:24.630> is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
basically meaning that if the tire is

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 
basically meaning that if the tire is
not<00:02:24.989> on<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.380> rim<00:02:25.590> properly<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.790> could

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
not on the rim properly what could

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.040 
not on the rim properly what could
happen<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.269> if<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> certain

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
happen is if you have it to a certain

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.900 
happen is if you have it to a certain
psi<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.769> go<00:02:28.860> over<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> bump<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.459> even<00:02:29.820> if

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
psi and you go over a bump or even if

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.780 
psi and you go over a bump or even if
you<00:02:29.970> don't<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.300> over<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.480> bump<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.920> tube<00:02:32.489> comes

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you don't go over a bump the tube comes

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.680 
you don't go over a bump the tube comes
out<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.300> tire<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.810> off<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.650> rim<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
out of the tire and off of the rim and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.420 
out of the tire and off of the rim and
explodes<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.800> actually<00:02:38.070> sounds<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
explodes and it actually sounds like a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.250 
explodes and it actually sounds like a
shotgun<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.120> pretty<00:02:39.390> scary

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.350 

and<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.620> last<00:02:46.799> flat<00:02:47.150> could<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.239> been

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and the last flat could have been

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.270 
and the last flat could have been
something<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.959> basically<00:02:49.500> stuck<00:02:50.069> in<00:02:50.189> your

tire like there's a there's a pretty

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.750 
tire like there's a there's a pretty
substantial<00:02:52.739> hole<00:02:53.189> right<00:02:53.370> here

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
substantial hole right here

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.160 
substantial hole right here
it<00:02:54.060> could<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.299> stuck<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.629> your<00:02:54.720> tire<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
