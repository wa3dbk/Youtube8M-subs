because<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.259> be<00:00:28.320> honest<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.740> really<00:00:29.009> quite

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
because to be honest I was really quite

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.189 
because to be honest I was really quite
disillusioned<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> disappointed<00:00:30.029> by<00:00:30.840> how

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
disillusioned and disappointed by how

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
disillusioned and disappointed by how
little<00:00:31.349> progress<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:32.309> making<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.700> terms<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
little progress we're making in terms of

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
little progress we're making in terms of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
getting more women in senior roles and I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.439 
getting more women in senior roles and I
suddenly<00:00:35.520> realized<00:00:35.879> we<00:00:35.970> were<00:00:36.059> doing<00:00:36.270> two

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
suddenly realized we were doing two

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.180 
suddenly realized we were doing two
things<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.930> least<00:00:37.050> two<00:00:37.470> wrong

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
things at least two wrong

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
things at least two wrong
we<00:00:38.579> weren't<00:00:38.699> involving<00:00:39.120> men<00:00:39.300> enough<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we weren't involving men enough and the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
we weren't involving men enough and the
members<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> 30%<00:00:40.980> grab<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> chair<00:00:41.640> men<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
members of the 30% grab a chair men of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.899 
members of the 30% grab a chair men of
British<00:00:42.870> companies<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> also<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.519> needed<00:00:44.699> a

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
British companies and also we needed a

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.569 
British companies and also we needed a
measurable<00:00:45.360> goal<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.260> am<00:00:46.769> anti<00:00:47.159> quotas

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
measurable goal and I am anti quotas

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
measurable goal and I am anti quotas
legislative<00:00:48.510> quotas<00:00:49.019> but<00:00:49.290> I<00:00:49.320> believe<00:00:49.650> in

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
legislative quotas but I believe in

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.829 
legislative quotas but I believe in
having<00:00:49.980> an<00:00:50.159> objective<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.690> it's

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
having an objective and I think it's

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.740 
having an objective and I think it's
been<00:00:51.989> interesting<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:54.150> target

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
been interesting to see how that target

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.859 
been interesting to see how that target
has<00:00:55.019> helped<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:56.120> elicit<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.479> faster

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
has helped to really elicit much faster

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:03.560 
has helped to really elicit much faster
pace<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.229> change<00:00:58.260> I<00:01:02.269> think<00:01:03.269> it's<00:01:03.390> really

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
pace of change I think it's really

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.359 
pace of change I think it's really
important<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.260> you're<00:01:04.379> starting<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:05.220> career

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
important when you're starting a career

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.050 
important when you're starting a career
to<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:07.020> focus<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.650> being<00:01:07.770> yourself<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to really focus on being yourself I

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.450 
to really focus on being yourself I
think<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.689> would<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:10.110> biggest<00:01:10.290> advice<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
think that would be my biggest advice to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.249 
think that would be my biggest advice to
anybody<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.390> early<00:01:12.720> stage<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.990> their

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
anybody at an early stage in their

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.960 
anybody at an early stage in their
career<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.040> people<00:01:14.400> especially<00:01:14.610> women

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
career a lot of people especially women

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
career a lot of people especially women
I<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.380> think<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> conform

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I think think that you have to conform

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820 
I think think that you have to conform
to<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.080> actually<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to get on actually you have to do the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
to get on actually you have to do the
good<00:01:19.950> job<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.509> noticed

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
as well and you have to make it very

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.649
