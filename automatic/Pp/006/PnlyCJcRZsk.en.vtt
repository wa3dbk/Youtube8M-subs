 although sometimes you can hear the opinion that 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.749
 then 7 and feeding is not necessarily but 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.910
 professionals and experienced gardeners lovers 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.340
 They say that blue care is very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.039
 untimely useful 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.539
 fertilization can increase 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.879
 tree immunity and resistance 

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.239
 frost 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.609
 the more so because the summer months then 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.399
 intense going on 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.810
 ripening abundant harvest 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.560
 pull up from plants 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.170
 a lot of strength 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.160
 these months it happens like this 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.420
 called arseny wave of growth sas higher 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.600
 roots which means it's time to do something 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.480
 autumn dressings 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.500
 sure to be confused paratroopers from 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.720
 the throne circle it will save you 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.090
 a lot of effort and time next year when 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.340
 from the seeming now small 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.660
 plant stores 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.180
 will develop impressive 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.480
 number of shoots 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.360
 before you bring in nutrients 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.570
 it is necessary to loosen the wall 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 wheel circle 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.950
 it won't take you long 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.910
 but its sects are quite palpable 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.910
 the board will not only help support 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.520
 I'll get it now 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.130
 and will contribute 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.650
 best fertilizer absorption 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.470
 but also allow you to fight with 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.850
 pests 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.450
 After all, during the time of Rahlin we do not violate the moves and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.509
 made by insects which means we interfere with them 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.940
 winter and spring to the surface 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.110
 soil 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.290
 finally 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.660
 make flooding 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.050
 Now you need to make phosphate and potash 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.200
 fertilizers and trace elements 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.990
 these fertilizers can be like water 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.120
 soluble 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.970
 never dissolving 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.110
 water 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.760
 raw you got the weather they can pour 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.630
 altar circle and punch profusely 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.820
 chop 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.220
 divorce at this time of the year to wear 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.870
 it does not follow 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.850
 an excess of that gold may even be 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.820
 dangerous autumn 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.159
 delayed ripening 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.429
 perennial victory 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.989
 and the price of stamina will decrease 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.069
 after fertilization 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.779
 its trunk circle should be covered with a layer 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:15.899
 mulch 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.329
 it can be mowed grass layer 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.369
 peat or decorative wood chips for example 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.180
 urine will help keep flank and nutritious 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.099
 substances in poland 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.389
 if all work is done on time and 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.279
 right 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.589
 tons of yesimov apple leaves more 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.639
 protected from the first days of spring will be 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.629
 ready for that 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.919
 to please you start separate 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.839
 bloom 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.400
 and then excellent harvest
