00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290 
let's talk about design at first glance
Joey<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> fan<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> ps4<00:00:35.700> his<00:00:36.000> design

and<00:02:16.840> over<00:02:17.020> time<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.290> found<00:02:17.410> myself<00:02:17.709> preferring

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
and over time I found myself preferring

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.120 
and over time I found myself preferring

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
PlayStation 3 this time around I think I

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.440 
PlayStation 3 this time around I think I
will<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.100> much<00:02:24.580> harder<00:02:24.819> time<00:02:24.970> choosing

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
will have a much harder time choosing

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.910 
will have a much harder time choosing
though<00:02:25.690> because<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.140> DualShock<00:02:26.620> 4

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
though because the DualShock 4

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.430 
though because the DualShock 4
controller<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> very<00:02:28.060> very<00:02:28.840> well<00:02:29.110> designed

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
controller is a very very well designed

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.620 
controller is a very very well designed
it's<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.640> heavier<00:02:30.970> than<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.239> DualShock

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
it's a little heavier than the DualShock

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.050 
it's a little heavier than the DualShock
3<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.230> adds<00:02:32.500> some<00:02:32.860> much-needed<00:02:33.340> weight

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
3 but that adds some much-needed weight

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.850 
3 but that adds some much-needed weight
to<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> controller<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.840> think<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.590> they've

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
to the controller I think and they've

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.380 
to the controller I think and they've
also<00:02:36.040> changed<00:02:36.190> up<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.819> design<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
also changed up the design of the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.090 
also changed up the design of the
triggers<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.870> bumpers<00:02:38.170> making<00:02:38.560> them<00:02:38.709> way

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
triggers and bumpers making them way

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.920 
triggers and bumpers making them way
more<00:02:39.130> ergonomic<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.090> easier<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.540> hit<00:02:40.750> when

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
more ergonomic and easier to hit when

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.360 
more ergonomic and easier to hit when
you're<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.170> jam<00:02:41.500> or<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:41.800> you're<00:02:41.890> panicked

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
you're in a jam or if you're panicked

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.310 
you're in a jam or if you're panicked
which<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.880> always<00:02:43.150> appreciate<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.050> touchpad

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
which I always appreciate the touchpad

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.130 
which I always appreciate the touchpad
on<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.040> front<00:02:45.280> controlled<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:46.150> drone<00:02:46.810> in

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
on the front controlled a drone in

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.690 
on the front controlled a drone in
Killzone<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.220> thought<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.519> was<00:02:48.610> an

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
Killzone and I thought that was an

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.150 
Killzone and I thought that was an
interesting<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.450> not<00:02:49.660> exactly<00:02:50.230> amazing<00:02:50.950> use

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
interesting but not exactly amazing use

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.370 
interesting but not exactly amazing use
of<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> touchpad<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.750> guess<00:02:52.989> we'll<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.260> to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
of the touchpad so I guess we'll have to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.290 
of the touchpad so I guess we'll have to
see<00:02:53.650> how<00:02:53.860> developers<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:54.700> make<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.090> touchpad

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
see how developers can make the touchpad

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.229 
see how developers can make the touchpad

so<00:04:41.980> I'll<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.340> say<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.850> think<00:04:43.000> the

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
so I'll just say that I think the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.000 
so I'll just say that I think the
sharing<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:43.870> social<00:04:44.020> features<00:04:44.470> are<00:04:44.740> nicely

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
sharing and social features are nicely

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.190 
sharing and social features are nicely
done<00:04:45.340> though<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:45.910> do<00:04:46.000> wish<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.510> could<00:04:46.720> sign<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.140> to

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
done though I do wish I could sign in to

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.840 
done though I do wish I could sign in to
my<00:04:47.260> Google+<00:04:47.770> account<00:04:47.890> instead<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.430> Facebook

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
my Google+ account instead of Facebook

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.330 
my Google+ account instead of Facebook
which<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.360> don't<00:04:49.450> actually<00:04:49.720> use<00:04:50.070> sharing<00:04:51.070> is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
which I don't actually use sharing is

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.310 
which I don't actually use sharing is
also<00:04:51.670> incredibly<00:04:52.090> easy<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.960> have<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.110> share

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
also incredibly easy you have a share

also incredibly easy you have a share

at<00:05:25.840> launch<00:05:26.020> but<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.320> really<00:05:26.860> exciting<00:05:27.010> part

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
at launch but the really exciting part

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.150 
at launch but the really exciting part
about<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.790> ps4<00:05:28.270> is<00:05:28.450> its<00:05:28.660> potential<00:05:29.229> so<00:05:29.860> think

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
about the ps4 is its potential so think

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.100 
about the ps4 is its potential so think
about<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.580> huge<00:05:30.940> difference<00:05:31.540> in<00:05:31.750> games

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
about the huge difference in games

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.310 
about the huge difference in games
between<00:05:32.490> Call<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.520> Duty<00:05:33.940> 3<00:05:34.210> which<00:05:34.840> was<00:05:35.050> a

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
between Call of Duty 3 which was a

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.010 
between Call of Duty 3 which was a
PlayStation<00:05:36.040> 3<00:05:36.370> launch<00:05:36.640> title<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.120> late<00:05:37.300> 2006

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
PlayStation 3 launch title in late 2006

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.200 
PlayStation 3 launch title in late 2006
and<00:05:38.290> Call<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.590> Duty<00:05:38.919> ghosts<00:05:39.520> also<00:05:39.729> for

and Call of Duty ghosts also for
PlayStation<00:05:40.720> 3<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:41.140> out<00:05:41.290> a<00:05:41.320> month<00:05:41.680> ago

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
PlayStation 3 but out a month ago

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.710 
PlayStation 3 but out a month ago
looking<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.610> million<00:05:43.030> times<00:05:43.210> better<00:05:43.390> there<00:05:43.690> is

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
looking a million times better there is

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.590 
looking a million times better there is
so<00:05:44.169> much<00:05:44.620> potential<00:05:45.160> in<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.580> ps4<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:46.240> it's

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
so much potential in the ps4 and it's

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.210 
so much potential in the ps4 and it's
not<00:05:46.780> about<00:05:47.020> what<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:47.350> can<00:05:47.530> do<00:05:47.680> right<00:05:47.950> this

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
not about what it can do right this

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.400 
not about what it can do right this
second<00:05:48.700> there's<00:05:49.120> only<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.330> handful<00:05:49.900> of<00:05:49.960> launch

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
second there's only a handful of launch

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.960 
second there's only a handful of launch
games<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:50.979> some<00:05:51.190> of<00:05:51.250> them<00:05:51.370> aren't<00:05:51.580> that<00:05:51.760> great

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
games and some of them aren't that great

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.210 
games and some of them aren't that great
but<00:05:52.270> we<00:05:52.600> hope<00:05:52.750> Sony<00:05:53.080> will<00:05:53.260> constantly<00:05:53.740> expand

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
but we hope Sony will constantly expand

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.130 
but we hope Sony will constantly expand
and<00:05:54.400> improve<00:05:54.460> on<00:05:54.790> their<00:05:54.910> UI<00:05:55.090> over<00:05:55.570> time<00:05:55.840> and

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
and improve on their UI over time and

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.870 
and improve on their UI over time and
one<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.800> other<00:05:56.919> things<00:05:57.160> is<00:05:57.310> it<00:05:57.460> that's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
one of the other things is it that's

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.370 
one of the other things is it that's
interesting<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.419> me<00:05:58.479> is<00:05:58.750> that<00:05:58.900> console

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
interesting to me is that console

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.350 
interesting to me is that console
updates<00:05:59.560> are<00:05:59.950> still<00:06:00.310> a<00:06:00.340> part<00:06:00.640> of<00:06:00.760> technology

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
updates are still a part of technology

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.320 
updates are still a part of technology
that<00:06:01.870> people<00:06:02.020> only<00:06:02.500> expect<00:06:02.979> to<00:06:03.070> upgrade<00:06:03.550> once

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
that people only expect to upgrade once

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.090 
that people only expect to upgrade once
every<00:06:04.570> five<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:04.870> ten<00:06:05.200> years<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:05.770> I<00:06:06.040> think

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
every five to ten years and I think

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.440 
every five to ten years and I think
that's<00:06:06.340> largely<00:06:06.520> because<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.090> takes<00:06:07.330> that

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
that's largely because it takes that

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.570 
that's largely because it takes that
long<00:06:07.720> to<00:06:07.780> mine<00:06:08.260> the<00:06:08.530> full<00:06:08.800> potential<00:06:09.190> out<00:06:09.430> of

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
long to mine the full potential out of

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.219 
long to mine the full potential out of
them<00:06:09.669> just<00:06:09.940> like<00:06:10.060> those<00:06:10.180> games<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.630> mentioned<00:06:10.750> a

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
them just like those games I mentioned a

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.260 
them just like those games I mentioned a
Joey<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.830> I<00:06:11.919> both<00:06:12.160> agree<00:06:12.370> diehard<00:06:12.910> gamers

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
Joey and I both agree diehard gamers

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.630 
Joey and I both agree diehard gamers

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
will absolutely love the console day one

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.760 
will absolutely love the console day one
but<00:06:16.150> for<00:06:16.330> casual<00:06:16.690> folks<00:06:16.900> looking<00:06:17.260> at<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.650> new
