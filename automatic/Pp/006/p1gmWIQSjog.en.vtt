00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
dig up and just stick it straight

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.650 
dig up and just stick it straight
through<00:00:11.519> until<00:00:12.889> you<00:00:13.889> get<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:15.619> the<00:00:16.619> bottom

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
through until you get to the bottom

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.700 
through until you get to the bottom
bedrock<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:23.390> basically<00:00:24.390> yeah<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.439> have

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
bedrock so basically yeah I know I have

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.339 
bedrock so basically yeah I know I have
some<00:00:26.300> emerald<00:00:27.300> there<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> will<00:00:28.019> show<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
some emerald there but I will show you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.189 
some emerald there but I will show you
why<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.680> haven't<00:00:29.070> picked<00:00:29.250> those<00:00:29.460> yet<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.199> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
why I haven't picked those yet so you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.490 
why I haven't picked those yet so you
just<00:00:31.500> dig<00:00:32.070> down<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> bedrock<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.230> did

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
just dig down to the bedrock like I did

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
just dig down to the bedrock like I did
here<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> back<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> rock<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
here you see the back of the rock and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.590 
here you see the back of the rock and
then<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> highest<00:00:37.440> point<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.600> one

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
then from the highest point that one

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.290 
then from the highest point that one
jump<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:41.600> one<00:00:42.600> two<00:00:43.410> three<00:00:44.010> four<00:00:44.670> five

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
jump about one two three four five

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
jump about one two three four five
between<00:00:46.260> three<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.649> five<00:00:46.940> steps<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> then

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
between three and five steps and then

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.560 
between three and five steps and then
you<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> room<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.739> just<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.570> better

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you make a room like this just to better

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.889 
you make a room like this just to better
pick<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:55.020> those<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> room

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
pick up those and then you make a room

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.000 
pick up those and then you make a room
like<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.460> to<00:01:00.170> start<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.289> form<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like this to start your form and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
like this to start your form and
basically<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> take<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
basically what you have to do is take a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.940 
basically what you have to do is take a
tunnel<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.129> dig<00:01:05.640> straight<00:01:06.210> through<00:01:06.950> forget

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
tunnel and dig straight through forget

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880 
tunnel and dig straight through forget
every<00:01:08.670> minerals<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.330> won't<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.890> that

a bigger quantity all you have to do is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.850 
a bigger quantity all you have to do is
enchant<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.040> pickaxe<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:45.000> silk<00:01:45.420> touch<00:01:45.860> which

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
enchant a pickaxe with silk touch which

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.710 
enchant a pickaxe with silk touch which
make<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.180> block<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:50.490> makes<00:01:50.759> its<00:01:50.939> home<00:01:51.030> like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
make the block it makes its home like

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
make the block it makes its home like
this<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.149> basically<00:01:54.259> or<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.880> have

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this one and basically or you can have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.550 
this one and basically or you can have
an<00:01:57.680> enchanted<00:01:58.680> pickaxe<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.969> fortune

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
an enchanted pickaxe with the fortune

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.240 
an enchanted pickaxe with the fortune
which<00:02:01.560> increase<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.030> quantity<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:04.159> diamonds

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
which increase the quantity of diamonds

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.180 
which increase the quantity of diamonds
drop<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.240> every<00:02:07.079> diamond<00:02:07.409> block<00:02:07.590> drops<00:02:07.950> one

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
drop so every diamond block drops one

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.150 
drop so every diamond block drops one
diamond

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
diamond

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.320 
diamond
but<00:02:09.940> if<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:11.020> have<00:02:11.140> fortune<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.710> can<00:02:11.890> drop

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
but if you have fortune you can drop

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.310 
but if you have fortune you can drop
maybe<00:02:13.330> three<00:02:13.720> diamonds<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> then<00:02:15.070> it's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.430> win

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
maybe three diamonds and then it's a win

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.550 
maybe three diamonds and then it's a win
so<00:02:17.320> if<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> fortune<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.690> higher<00:02:20.230> rank

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so if you have a fortune the higher rank

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
so if you have a fortune the higher rank
the<00:02:20.800> bigger<00:02:21.280> quantity<00:02:21.790> we<00:02:21.910> get<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.360> bigger

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
the bigger quantity we get on the bigger

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.510 
the bigger quantity we get on the bigger
chance<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.310> pick

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
chance so all you have to do is to pick

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.060 
chance so all you have to do is to pick
it<00:02:27.730> with<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.300> don't<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.690> pickaxe<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.740> me<00:02:29.920> at

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
it with I don't have a pickaxe on me at

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.740 
it with I don't have a pickaxe on me at
the<00:02:30.160> moment

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the moment

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.550 
the moment
I<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.320> pick<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:34.320> then<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.410> get<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
I have to pick it and then you get a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.070 
I have to pick it and then you get a
