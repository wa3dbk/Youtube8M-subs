00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.090 
experience to experience and see if we
can<00:02:32.900> do<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.170> again<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:33.739> can't<00:02:33.860> get<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
can do that again see if we can't get to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:46.180 
can do that again see if we can't get to
see<00:02:34.220> come<00:02:34.340> up<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.489> little<00:02:34.550> better<00:02:44.709> yeah<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.069> they

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
see come up a little better yeah so they

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.150 
see come up a little better yeah so they
don't<00:02:46.370> sync<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.730> perfectly<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.080> bad

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
don't sync up perfectly but it's not bad

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.979 
don't sync up perfectly but it's not bad
I<00:02:49.300> think<00:02:50.300> that's<00:02:50.420> cool<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.780> them<00:02:50.870> both

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
I think that's cool to have them both

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.360 
I think that's cool to have them both
going<00:02:51.200> together

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.640 

and<00:02:55.370> again<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:56.090> does<00:02:56.330> have<00:02:56.540> input<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
and again it does have input in the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:09.750 
and again it does have input in the
driver<00:02:57.890> itself<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.430> does<00:02:58.610> also<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.090> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.979 

so<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.819> does<00:03:10.970> still<00:03:11.120> have<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.330> maximum<00:03:11.599> Drive

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
so it does still have the maximum Drive

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.990 
so it does still have the maximum Drive
there<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.290> well<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:13.489> just<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> show<00:03:13.879> it

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
there as well and then just to show it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.149 
there as well and then just to show it
off<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.510> image<00:03:15.290> both<00:03:15.560> off<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:15.950> double

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
off in the image both off in the double

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.039 
off in the image both off in the double
drivers<00:03:16.489> it's<00:03:17.209> not<00:03:17.360> going<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.569> be<00:03:17.659> really<00:03:17.900> any

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
drivers it's not going to be really any

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:35.349 
drivers it's not going to be really any
different<00:03:18.379> than<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.310> stand<00:03:19.579> but<00:03:34.359> so

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
different than in the stand but so

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.479 
different than in the stand but so
there's<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.769> while<00:03:37.010> we're<00:03:37.159> here<00:03:37.310> I

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
there's that and while we're here I

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.869 
there's that and while we're here I
figured<00:03:37.790> we'd<00:03:37.909> have<00:03:38.060> some<00:03:38.239> fun<00:03:38.269> with<00:03:39.879> with

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
figured we'd have some fun with with

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:47.550 
figured we'd have some fun with with
some<00:03:41.090> joker<00:03:41.359> memories<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.319> can<00:03:42.560> now

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.690 

since<00:03:48.560> we're<00:03:48.739> doing<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.190> figured<00:03:49.400> we<00:03:49.489> show

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
since we're doing this I figured we show

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.500 
since we're doing this I figured we show
off<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.859> st2<00:03:51.859> Joker<00:03:52.430> memory<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.239> driver

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
off the st2 Joker memory in the driver

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.330 
off the st2 Joker memory in the driver
because<00:03:53.930> with<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.139> TT<00:03:54.379> Joker<00:03:54.620> memory<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.250> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
because with the TT Joker memory and the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.920 
because with the TT Joker memory and the
regular<00:03:55.639> DX<00:03:55.909> memory<00:03:56.180> or<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:56.450> could<00:03:56.599> use<00:03:56.780> you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
regular DX memory or you could use you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.210 
regular DX memory or you could use you
could<00:03:57.049> use<00:03:57.109> this<00:03:57.319> show<00:03:57.500> throw<00:03:57.680> memory<00:03:58.010> as<00:03:58.099> well

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
could use this show throw memory as well

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.149 
could use this show throw memory as well
you<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.060> do<00:03:59.329> the<00:04:00.109> Joker<00:04:00.620> Joker<00:04:00.769> combination

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
you can do the Joker Joker combination

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:20.830 
you can do the Joker Joker combination
from<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.340> movie<00:04:18.849> so<00:04:19.849> just<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.510> show<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.750> off

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
from the movie so just to show it off

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.150 
from the movie so just to show it off
you<00:04:21.019> can<00:04:21.169> do<00:04:21.289> that<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.500> can<00:04:21.620> do<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.859> Joker

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
you can do that you can do the Joker

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.990 
you can do that you can do the Joker
Joker<00:04:22.340> from<00:04:23.349> from<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:24.440> common<00:04:24.740> writer<00:04:28.000> and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
Joker from from the common writer and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.110 
Joker from from the common writer and
then<00:04:29.120> just<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.360> show<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.630> off<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:29.870> can<00:04:29.990> see

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
then just to show it off you can see

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.100 
then just to show it off you can see
well<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.150> guess<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.419> kind<00:04:32.599> of<00:04:32.660> did<00:04:32.810> show<00:04:33.020> it

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
well I guess that kind of did show it

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.600 
well I guess that kind of did show it
showed<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.889> delay<00:04:34.130> between<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.490> two

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
showed that the delay between the two

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.879 
showed that the delay between the two
jokers<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.570> yeah<00:04:35.720> there<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.470> is

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
jokers so yeah there it is

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.920 
jokers so yeah there it is
just<00:04:37.760> a<00:04:37.820> quick<00:04:38.000> little<00:04:38.120> bonus<00:04:38.539> here<00:04:38.720> there's

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
just a quick little bonus here there's

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.950 
just a quick little bonus here there's
the<00:04:39.050> cyclone<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.889> DX<00:04:40.520> cyclone<00:04:41.060> Jesco

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
the cyclone the DX cyclone Jesco

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.050 
the cyclone the DX cyclone Jesco
exclusive<00:04:42.590> memory<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:44.660> works<00:04:44.870> with<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
exclusive memory that works with the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.430 
exclusive memory that works with the
with<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.150> show<00:04:47.330> throw<00:04:47.599> memory<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.260> just

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
with the show throw memory and just

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.420 
with the show throw memory and just
because<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.710> liked<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.070> much<00:04:49.130> we're<00:04:49.370> gonna

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
because I liked it so much we're gonna

00:04:49.430 --> 00:05:01.880 
because I liked it so much we're gonna
do<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.669> one<00:04:49.760> more<00:04:49.820> time

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.890 

awesome
