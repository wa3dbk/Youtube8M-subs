00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
chem strikes but this just seemed a bit

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.260 
chem strikes but this just seemed a bit
more<00:00:41.790> tougher<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.219> it<00:00:44.219> seems<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.120> all

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
more tougher and it seems that it's all

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.779 
more tougher and it seems that it's all
was<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> Bulldog<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.700> my

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
was the Bulldog then this is like my

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.430 
was the Bulldog then this is like my
third<00:00:47.940> game<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> infected<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.260> been

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
third game is infected now and it's been

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
third game is infected now and it's been
the<00:00:49.620> Bulldog<00:00:49.890> every<00:00:50.309> time<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.840> know

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the Bulldog every time so I don't know

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.020 
the Bulldog every time so I don't know
if<00:00:52.170> I'll<00:00:52.320> used<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> change<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.039> higher<00:00:53.190> we

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
if I'll used to change it up higher we

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.910 
if I'll used to change it up higher we
survived<00:00:54.360> yay<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:57.500> now<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.559> need<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> find

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
survived yay so now we need to find

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.950 
survived yay so now we need to find
somewhere<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> hide

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
somewhere to hide

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.789 
somewhere to hide
well<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.100> hide<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> guess<00:01:03.530> survive<00:01:04.530> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
well not hide I guess survive this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.120 
well not hide I guess survive this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that those like loads of different soaps

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
that those like loads of different soaps
like<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> father<00:01:12.659> were<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> Lynx<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
like the father were like the Lynx and I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.170 
like the father were like the Lynx and I
rightfully<00:01:14.189> could<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.520> but<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.760> seems<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
rightfully could use but just seems and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.810 
rightfully could use but just seems and
this<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> Bulldog<00:01:16.229> sofa<00:01:16.820> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

where<00:01:17.970> we're<00:01:18.060> gonna<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:18.780> gonna

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
where we're gonna get what we're gonna

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.859 
where we're gonna get what we're gonna
go<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:20.220> seems<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.939> safe<00:01:21.210> they've<00:01:21.720> got

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
go this seems pretty safe they've got

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.469 
go this seems pretty safe they've got
those<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.200> spike<00:01:22.530> ball<00:01:22.740> thingies<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.479> being

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
those like spike ball thingies so being

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820
