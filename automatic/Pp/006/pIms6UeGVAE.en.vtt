00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.889
 friends of androidworld.it today we are 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:14.120
 in front of a rather large package not 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.150
 I know if he could appreciate the 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.779
 size from the hand camcorder in the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.640
 box of the usual smartphone in fact there 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.220
 let us occupy today with a nas a nas 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.169
 of the synod logic called ds 214 play 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.239
 which has so many features in part 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.850
 are illustrated on this side of the 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.339
 box works as a media server with 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.219
 real-time transcoding of videos into 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.079
 so you can send them wirelessly from 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.589
 mobile devices or televisions 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.510
 compatible photosharing mail server if 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.230
 we wanted to create a server tape from 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.960
 personal mail server web server server 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.210
 printing support for devices 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.069
 furniture also for various systems 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.079
 operating windows mac linux android 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.609
 iphone and pato windows phone 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.739
 obviously we will deal with the part 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.020
 android that presents many 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.590
 apps with you can check them from 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.870
 remote 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.460
 the nas functions obviously back up 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.860
 file data protection functions 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.290
 sharing you can create your own cloud 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.710
 staff if you don't want to rely on 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.500
 dropbox drive etc. you can do it 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.110
 precisely at home substantially and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.300
 also functions as a surveillance server 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.370
 in short, it is a device destined not to 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.310
 only to domestic users but also to 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.830
 the professional one and as we will see 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.880
 in fact it also has a cost not 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.510
 just accessible to everyone if we want 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:49.180
 then let's try to open it without 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.040
 destroy the package too much 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.260
 ok 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.510
 then this is inside the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.150
 box which as you see divided into 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.010
 various parts 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.410
 here there should be the true nas e 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.470
 let's just put it for a moment 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.840
 quite heavy about a kilo 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.180
 a kilo and a half without any hard disk 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.200
 is inserted inside it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 let's see later here what is ok 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.580
 power cord of course 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:26.990
 including German is another box that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.010
 suppose it will contain ok manuals 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.440
 exact 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:37.250
 now we have the welcome pollin of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:40.640
 synology ok screws this should be 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.170
 the power supply so real which 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.170
 fairy tale we have seen before 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.050
 and here we have the rj45 ethernet cable 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.959
 no particular surprise the hard disk 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.870
 therefore it is not included in the package 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.670
 will go to this part on the site of 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.640
 all the hard disks are synology 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:08.600
 compatible you can insert various cuts 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.670
 both from type hdd and type ssd 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.709
 the nas should be able to 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.709
 host up to 2 at the same time 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.280
 it seems to me if I'm not mistaken that among the 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.360
 hard disk you can get up to a 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.510
 maximum of 4 terabytes I would say are more 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.170
 that is sufficient for each type of 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.760
 need 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.330
 ok this is the real monster mas a little bit from 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.489
 all angles the synology brand 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.340
 campsites laterally a little used too 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.200
 as an air intake on the back we have the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.180
 fan under two usb ports and a port 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.250
 ethernet 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.260
 two usb ports judging by color 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.799
 should be 3.0 and the entry of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.000
 power supply and the door sata here or that 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.489
 there must be loc 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.569
 on the other side, always the brand 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:09.019
 synology and this is the frontal part ds 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.560
 214 play with the various status indicators 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.540
 and one sd card reader and another 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.410
 usb port which in this case should 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.539
 but be 2.0 that is away from the table 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.300
 we're going to connect and we'll do it 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.820
 know how this can be done 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.729
 interface with your android 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.729
 home network and even with the TV
