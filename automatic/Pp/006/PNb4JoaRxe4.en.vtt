00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi we are all here with a new one 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.290
 video of gta 5 and in this video vi 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.700
 I'll show you how to unlock the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.519
 kraken submarine that is available on 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.000
 gta 5 for playstation 4 and xbox one e 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.760
 later for gt5 per pc 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.210
 then a certain point of the campaign 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.689
 you will receive a message that says 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:32.210
 especially after secondary missions 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 of the photographer with franklin you will receive 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.700
 a message that will tell you to take pictures 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 the fauna of san andreas of los santos e 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.129
 together living also gave a list 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.390
 of the animals that you will have to photograph and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 I advise you to register the animals 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 that you have to photograph for so you can 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.239
 have a list and search for them 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.949
 then I'll show you that last one 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.080
 the animal I have to photograph is the chicken 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 here it is done use square to send le 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.729
 photographs at the los tourist office 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.360
 santos and you will have to do this for each 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.909
 animal once you have photographed 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.220
 an animal will be written one in twenty 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.500
 photographs taken and the real e 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.110
 you will receive the email from the office 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 tourist that will tell you how many more 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.329
 species, however, this is missing from the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.860
 end because I made them all I have them 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.930
 photographed all who are not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.439
 so many did it one evening in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.619
 two hours 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.980
 I had already photographed all the animals 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.870
 because the trick is to know where they are 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.760
 the locations of the animals you find 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.280
 also in some of my videos for example 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.690
 that of all animals 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.880
 however this is there mail of 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.800
 congratulations that says all 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.320
 other participants are dead or are 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.480
 fallen or been torn to pieces by 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.400
 animals and that we are the last 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.030
 left who completed the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.610
 task and therefore we are entitled to 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.980
 prize and the prize is in fact the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.930
 kraken submarine which is a new one 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.050
 different submarine more powerful however 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.900
 not with weapons as previously thought 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 from the photo now the unlocked and the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.310
 you will find the submarine here 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 there is indeed written a submarine and there is 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.490
 a submarine icon naturally and 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.810
 just go to a dock and find yourself 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.280
 immediately the brand new submarine then 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.170
 I advise you to do it when you have 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.990
 two or three hours is not a thing 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.270
 long the thing actually quite a long time 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.860
 is to be able to photograph animals 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.290
 because for example with wild boar 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.660
 I only put there in half an hour because 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.970
 I could never get it right in 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.030
 how much not the animals will not have to 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.459
 look at the camera but there will be 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.200
 however you cannot of course 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.510
 take it from far back but 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.209
 you will have to photograph it if possible 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.130
 front side so this is the 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.750
 submarine I hope the video is there 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.670
 liked 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.310
 of course I won't be able to do a tutorial 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.160
 on how to where and how to find 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.480
 animals because they will play however on gta 5 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.420
 for the playstation 4 they spend it 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.950
 really many and to find dogs 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 you will have to go to 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.690
 in the place where it is in the cinema or in the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.790
 place near franklin's house there 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.200
 they are always the dogs that run there then 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.819
 let's see everyone with an upcoming video 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.440
 I hope this was yours 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.849
 liking 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.849
 see you next video
