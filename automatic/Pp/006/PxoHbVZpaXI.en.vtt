doing or we're sort of try to catch a

trend or things like this and you really

trend or things like this and you really
you<00:05:08.690> have<00:05:09.139> to<00:05:09.229> really<00:05:09.410> look<00:05:09.560> internally<00:05:09.949> and

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
you have to really look internally and

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.740 
you have to really look internally and

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
like and only do those things and then

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.999 
like and only do those things and then
make<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.180> very<00:05:14.810> instinctual<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.860> you're
