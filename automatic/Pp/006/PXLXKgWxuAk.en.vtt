fifteen<00:02:55.800> seconds<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.580> turns<00:02:56.820> off<00:02:57.000> again<00:02:57.270> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
fifteen seconds it turns off again and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.260 
fifteen seconds it turns off again and
stop<00:02:57.870> charging<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:59.520> really<00:02:59.790> confused<00:02:59.970> me

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to a 4g phone because this hasn't got 4g

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.110 
to a 4g phone because this hasn't got 4g
and<00:03:40.320> i<00:03:40.380> really<00:03:40.650> do<00:03:40.770> like<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.100> 4g<00:03:41.580> coverage

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
and i really do like the 4g coverage
