not bad but I did think that that entire
thing<00:04:04.330> where<00:04:04.480> they<00:04:04.570> show<00:04:04.780> like<00:04:05.050> all<00:04:05.260> those

thing where they show like all those

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.240 
thing where they show like all those
like<00:04:05.800> like<00:04:06.670> semi<00:04:07.360> pointless<00:04:08.020> panels<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:08.950> then

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
like like semi pointless panels but then

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.250 
like like semi pointless panels but then
at<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.610> end<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.090> kind<00:04:10.300> of<00:04:10.390> was<00:04:10.840> like<00:04:10.870> hey<00:04:11.200> you
