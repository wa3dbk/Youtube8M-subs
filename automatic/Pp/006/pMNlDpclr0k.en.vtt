00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:05.960
 There are also some very good patents and a question arises 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.010
 in terms of 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.949
 MÃ¤rz confesses with deep stitched stitches 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.629
 I think it concerns a few for patient and the temporal writes 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.650
 In addition, his stitches time keeps getting older second Beijing is safe 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.499
 happy to knit on some 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.110
 a stitch on the right 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.550
 and one marches i for sting 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 whoever she stings is very high up in the machine 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.560
 Marshall stung at the depth 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.880
 Stich TuS, so to speak, one floor below 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.670
 a stitch on the right 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.470
 a marched lower stinging 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.160
 a back in the left under the stitch a stinging this 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.020
 Legal Practice Reken 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.130
 always alternating a stitch on the right one marches deeper engraved 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.860
 and you start by the way of the Four, so test the first row that is 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.160
 the first row 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.700
 Knitwear can be a success therefore 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.970
 always alternating a stitch right a stitch right depth stung 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.130
 that had to consist only of four parts actually only as bantams 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.960
 be offset 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.210
 so that we have the first easter eggs on the front 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.740
 do knits on the back 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.810
 another agricultural machine 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 the Strike Schiemer right 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.520
 and now this first marched has stung the depth 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.980
 around which the little extra rides have 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910
 You draw themes 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 and not at first sight 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.840
 and I showed off the top ten 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.510
 when i go there is a longer rides of that is not the rides with 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.590
 Knitted the dead mashup rest 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.780
 Son is still subject driveways 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.189
 and think strictly 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.189
 with the stitch right together 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 the next marches just stretched right 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.870
 and the next machine again with these over and before that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.529
 lying rides 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.419
 breaks down routes 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.899
 So not the ride with her team marches along 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.329
 who was knitted to the Erstrat 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.939
 but the longer rides the before lies with the knitting also marchik 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.669
 together right off 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.639
 a stitch on the right 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.489
 with the preceding journeys and soon the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.379
 farewell 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.079
 a stitch on the right the next Marshall 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.729
 stretching together 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.289
 a stitch on the right 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.849
 the next Marshall knit never repeat this is the 2 the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.849
 got to 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.549
 This had to be different for the patient, in fact, only very different 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.819
 few of 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.409
 March patent but it does know Macs 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.630
 that is, the tissue is actually 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.180
 dense made very small gaps and is also in Pieschen Indians as the net 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.869
 patient 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.179
 exciting is now firmer 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:26.539
 the tri team had to go hand in hand and that's just what we set 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.159
 template 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.560
 even the first machine depth died the 2 of the right 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.249
 Depth stung 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.629
 right 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.599
 Depth stung 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 Judge ash 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.339
 always changing 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.339
 Depth ripped right soggy 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.939
 as similar as when others and band of other patients had to 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.419
 Dietmar Schipp is the other one who has just laid around 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.919
 which is stretched to the right and the other stitch becomes depth to the right 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.919
 razor 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.759
 the third row is the same as the first row 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.759
 it will probably not put a stitch 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.049
 accordingly 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.509
 Animal cruelty is knit as well as the second part without 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.509
 put a stitch 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.879
 here could have row 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.069
 look down 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 9 a stitch on the right 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.270
 and next time send them together with the present trips 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.240
 Stretch one right 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.930
 Marcia stretches together 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.569
 no message 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.930
 Lashed together 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.100
 were again and again 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.270
 So that's a very simple one she would have to be very sophisticated 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.270
 There is more than military service knit it beautiful 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.720
 How to register Belta's patent then you still pull out of even a few races here 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.779
 nothing at all from the pattern 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:18.099
 but it takes at least ten and twelve club up the pattern 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.099
 unfolded correctly 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.740
 Prices these four series are repeated continuously 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.409
 further below the teams test pattern 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.210
 that was already the whole secret and informed of 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.509
 Knitted that gives itself this beautiful 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.180
 It was necessary for the clique to show up then
