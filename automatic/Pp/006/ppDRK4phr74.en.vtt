00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
already know but what they did say is
that<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> counter<00:01:16.500> Mellie<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> from<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
knifed in the back you can't counter it

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.800 
knifed in the back you can't counter it
but<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.460> also<00:01:23.610> confirmed<00:01:23.939> something<00:01:24.570> else

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
but they also confirmed something else

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
but they also confirmed something else
which<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.049> quite<00:01:25.320> interesting<00:01:25.939> peaking<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
which is quite interesting peaking and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.800 
which is quite interesting peaking and
leaning<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:28.200> battlefield<00:01:28.880> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.299> want<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
leaning is in battlefield if you want to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.280 
leaning is in battlefield if you want to
lean<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:32.479> hind<00:01:33.479> cover<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.110> well

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
lean you can if your hind cover as well

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
lean you can if your hind cover as well
and<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.250> scope<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.210> peek

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and you scope in you will actually peek

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
and you scope in you will actually peek
over<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> cover<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:38.009> interesting<00:01:38.549> mechanic

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
over the cover to interesting mechanic

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609 
over the cover to interesting mechanic
I'm<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.540> interesting<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.079> how<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
I'm really interesting to see how that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
I'm really interesting to see how that
pans<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.310> I'll<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.610> wait<00:01:42.450> until<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.720> play

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pans out and I'll just wait until I play

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
pans out and I'll just wait until I play
the<00:01:43.049> game<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.350> beer<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.070> how<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the game in beer to really see how that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.300 
the game in beer to really see how that
is<00:01:44.610> gonna<00:01:44.820> work<00:01:45.290> also<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:46.619> thing<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is gonna work also one other thing is

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.999 
is gonna work also one other thing is
that<00:01:47.670> diving<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> now<00:01:48.869> dive<00:01:49.200> underwater

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that diving you can now dive underwater

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.690 
that diving you can now dive underwater
as<00:01:50.549> well<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:52.079> pretty<00:01:52.470> intriguing<00:01:52.950> but

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
as well so that's pretty intriguing but
