owner decided to just spray-paint one on
windows<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.220> don't<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.820> they<00:01:54.240> did<00:01:54.600> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
windows way I don't know they did that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.719 
windows way I don't know they did that
and<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.259> we're<00:01:55.439> gonna<00:01:55.560> change<00:01:55.860> those<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and so we're gonna change those this is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
and so we're gonna change those this is
like<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> storage<00:01:57.390> box<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
like a storage box on the back of the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.270 
like a storage box on the back of the
trailer

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
trailer

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
trailer
it's<00:01:59.700> ugly<00:02:00.119> obviously<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it's ugly obviously right so we want to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.959 
it's ugly obviously right so we want to
do<00:02:02.100> something<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.930> maybe<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.399> build

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
do something and maybe like build

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
do something and maybe like build
something<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.570> looks<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.960> old<00:02:07.229> suitcases

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
something that looks like old suitcases

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.200 
something that looks like old suitcases
so<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.520> would<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:08.819> stack<00:02:09.390> suitcases

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
so it would look like stack suitcases

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.710 
so it would look like stack suitcases
then<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.750> top<00:02:10.960> one<00:02:10.990> will<00:02:11.350> open<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:12.220> hold

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
then just the top one will open to hold

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.820 
then just the top one will open to hold
stuff<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.020> hold<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.440> outside<00:02:14.710> of<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
stuff that you hold on the outside of a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.530 
stuff that you hold on the outside of a
trailer<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:15.430> even<00:02:15.520> know<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:16.390> need

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
trailer I don't even know we need

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.570 
trailer I don't even know we need
storage<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.260> we're<00:02:17.470> keeping<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:17.920> changing

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
storage so we're keeping that changing

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.390 
storage so we're keeping that changing
it<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.880> making<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.210> not<00:02:19.390> ugly<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:21.220> is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
it and making it not ugly so this is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.250 
it and making it not ugly so this is
like<00:02:21.580> obviously<00:02:22.210> really<00:02:22.510> messed<00:02:22.750> up<00:02:22.960> but

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
like obviously really messed up but

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.470 
like obviously really messed up but
something<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.310> really<00:02:24.520> liked<00:02:24.910> about<00:02:25.210> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
something that we really liked about the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.440

doing a ton of research on like storage

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.480 
doing a ton of research on like storage
options<00:06:36.600> for<00:06:36.810> RVs<00:06:37.140> and<00:06:37.170> stuff<00:06:37.560> and<00:06:37.830> so<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:38.220> want

to<00:06:38.550> do<00:06:38.670> some<00:06:38.880> that<00:06:39.060> are<00:06:39.180> like<00:06:39.300> underneath<00:06:39.780> and

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
to do some that are like underneath and

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.920 
to do some that are like underneath and
you<00:06:40.140> can<00:06:40.290> pull<00:06:40.500> up<00:06:41.330> so<00:06:42.330> yeah<00:06:42.510> this<00:06:42.780> will

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
probably just end up being like a

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.280 
probably just end up being like a
queen-size<00:06:44.640> bed<00:06:44.670> situation<00:06:45.210> back<00:06:45.690> here<00:06:46.020> I

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
queen-size bed situation back here I

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.860 
queen-size bed situation back here I
think<00:06:46.890> before<00:06:47.130> it<00:06:47.640> was<00:06:47.820> like<00:06:48.000> two<00:06:48.330> more<00:06:48.690> like

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
think before it was like two more like

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.300 
think before it was like two more like
futon<00:06:49.470> ease<00:06:49.650> situations<00:06:50.370> oh<00:06:52.160> it's<00:06:53.160> definitely

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
futon ease situations oh it's definitely

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.420 
futon ease situations oh it's definitely
bunk<00:06:53.730> beds<00:06:53.970> okay<00:06:54.240> Wow<00:06:54.710> okay<00:06:55.710> so<00:06:55.890> I<00:06:56.190> guess

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
back here so four beds we definitely

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.090 
back here so four beds we definitely
don't<00:07:02.580> need<00:07:02.820> that<00:07:03.030> much<00:07:03.320> sleeping<00:07:04.320> space<00:07:04.620> so
