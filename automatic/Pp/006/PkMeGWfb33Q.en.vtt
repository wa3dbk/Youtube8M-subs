on to the previous tip of the week a
little<00:00:12.840> bit<00:00:12.930> and<00:00:13.050> talk<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.440> multiple

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
little bit and talk about multiple

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.220 
little bit and talk about multiple
models<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.520> drawing<00:00:14.880> now<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:16.049> use

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
models on a drawing now you can use

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.929 
models on a drawing now you can use
maybe<00:00:16.770> some<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.160> know<00:00:17.189> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.490> use<00:00:17.609> more

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
maybe some of you know you can use more

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.720 
maybe some of you know you can use more
than<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.480> model<00:00:19.019> to<00:00:19.589> drive<00:00:19.919> views<00:00:20.519> on<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
than one model to drive views on a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
than one model to drive views on a
drawing<00:00:21.089> we're<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> create<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.470> couple

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
drawing we're going to create a couple

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.739 
drawing we're going to create a couple
extra<00:00:23.160> models<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.789> drawing<00:00:23.999> and<00:00:24.240> show

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
extra models on this drawing and show

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.419 
extra models on this drawing and show
you<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> neat<00:00:25.169> shortcut<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:26.009> telling<00:00:26.279> which

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
you a neat shortcut for telling which

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.399 
you a neat shortcut for telling which
one<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.759> active<00:00:27.179> and<00:00:27.300> switching<00:00:27.900> between<00:00:27.929> them

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
one is active and switching between them

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.460 
one is active and switching between them
right<00:00:29.339> now<00:00:29.519> if<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.089> the<00:00:30.210> lower<00:00:30.509> left

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
right now if you look in the lower left

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
right now if you look in the lower left
hand<00:00:31.679> side<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.759> current<00:00:33.180> model

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
hand side you can see the current model

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.570 
hand side you can see the current model
is<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.080> engine<00:00:34.590> model<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.040> we've<00:00:35.130> driven<00:00:35.400> a

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
is the engine model and we've driven a

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.550 
is the engine model and we've driven a
view<00:00:35.730> from<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.900> on<00:00:36.990> this<00:00:37.110> drawing<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
view from that but on this drawing I

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.050 
view from that but on this drawing I
want<00:00:37.740> to<00:00:37.830> show<00:00:37.980> views<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.490> some<00:00:38.670> other<00:00:38.820> pieces

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
want to show views of some other pieces

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.510 
want to show views of some other pieces
that<00:00:39.360> make<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.830> go<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> drawing

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that make it up so I go to the drawing

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.110 
that make it up so I go to the drawing
models<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.350> could<00:00:43.350> say<00:00:43.500> add<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> model<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.610> let's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
models I could say add a model and let's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.420 
models I could say add a model and let's
grab<00:00:45.510> let's<00:00:45.870> say<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.290> cylinder<00:00:46.800> part<00:00:47.270> and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
grab let's say the cylinder part and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
grab let's say the cylinder part and
let's<00:00:50.430> add<00:00:50.580> another<00:00:50.640> model<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.890> let's<00:00:52.890> go

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
let's add another model and let's go

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
let's add another model and let's go
with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.730> piston<00:00:54.510> part<00:00:56.330> now<00:00:57.330> we<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.720> do

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
with the piston part now we can do

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
with the piston part now we can do
anything<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.860> set<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.220> current

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
anything in here to set the current

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
anything in here to set the current
model<00:00:59.850> let's<00:01:00.000> say<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.240> want<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.540> set<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> model

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
model let's say I want to set the model

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.779 
model let's say I want to set the model
as<00:01:02.570> being<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> piston<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.609> once<00:01:05.609> I<00:01:05.729> do

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
as being the piston right now once I do

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.450 
as being the piston right now once I do
that<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.119> shows<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.899> what<00:01:07.079> model<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.009> active

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that it shows me what model is active

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.870 
that it shows me what model is active
down<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.149> that<00:01:09.240> same<00:01:09.630> left<00:01:10.499> view<00:01:10.880> but

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
down here in that same left view but

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.539 
down here in that same left view but
let's<00:01:12.060> create<00:01:12.359> a<00:01:12.420> new<00:01:12.539> view<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.499> that

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
let's create a new view from that

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.480 
let's create a new view from that
so<00:01:16.539> when<00:01:16.659> I<00:01:16.689> pop<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:16.990> location<00:01:17.619> for<00:01:17.829> that<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.250> I

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
so when I pop a location for that and I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.870 
so when I pop a location for that and I
pick<00:01:18.759> my<00:01:18.969> little<00:01:19.539> display<00:01:20.439> mode<00:01:23.880> that's

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
pick my little display mode that's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.359 
pick my little display mode that's
active<00:01:25.450> now<00:01:25.899> here's<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> trick<00:01:26.829> is<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.039> don't

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
active now here's the trick is you don't

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.340 
active now here's the trick is you don't
have<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.789> fool<00:01:27.969> around<00:01:28.090> going<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.630> those<00:01:28.869> menus

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
have to fool around going to those menus

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.919 
have to fool around going to those menus
if<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:30.189> go<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.850> list<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.240> what<00:01:31.420> model<00:01:31.810> is

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
if you go to the list of what model is

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.649 
if you go to the list of what model is
active<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.979> can<00:01:33.009> double<00:01:33.490> click<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.090> it

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
active you can double click on it and it

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.359 
active you can double click on it and it
shows<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:35.110> all<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.380> models<00:01:36.069> that<00:01:36.250> are

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
shows you all the models that are

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.240 
shows you all the models that are
available<00:01:36.459> to<00:01:37.270> drive<00:01:37.479> views<00:01:37.929> on<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> drawing<00:01:38.469> so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
available to drive views on a drawing so

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.980 
available to drive views on a drawing so
if<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:39.429> want<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.729> make<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:39.939> view<00:01:40.420> driven<00:01:40.810> by<00:01:40.929> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
if I want to make a view driven by the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.080 
if I want to make a view driven by the
cylinder<00:01:41.439> model<00:01:41.709> I<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.459> click<00:01:42.670> on<00:01:42.789> it<00:01:42.850> right

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
cylinder model I just click on it right

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.740 
cylinder model I just click on it right
there<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.569> becomes<00:01:44.380> active<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.299> when<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.479> make

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
there it becomes active so when I make

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
there it becomes active so when I make
another<00:01:47.020> view<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.409> pop<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.069> right<00:01:48.280> here

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
another view and pop it right here

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.250 
another view and pop it right here
and<00:01:50.340> we'll<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.940> for<00:01:51.330> neatness<00:01:51.780> sake<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
and we'll go for neatness sake to the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.050 
and we'll go for neatness sake to the
same<00:01:52.470> display<00:01:52.920> mode

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
