00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.100
 Well, here we have the new model of 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.420
 karma pretty changed for the better in my 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.430
 opinion is the truth that is much more 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.719
 nice more stylized and especially 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.549
 remember more the new models that 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.199
 they are getting higher as can be 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.300
 sad of fate or annie already you see that goes 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.189
 noticing more for that kind of champion with 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.560
 this kind of floating dragon donut 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.270
 here but good so it has been very good 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.920
 this new karma and let's move on too 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.380
 to see your new skills that are very 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.030
 interesting let's go there good first thing 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.860
 before explaining his skills is 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.719
 explain the mechanics of the last of 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.219
 calm that so you do not know them are 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.109
 something different from other champions that 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.879
 it is very possible that you do not know that before 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.589
 did not take karma nobody hope that 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.760
 this changes a bit but so far not 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.859
 has been a very popular champion since 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 we know why it's good so that 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.949
 know karma does not have one last in 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.659
 normal but you have it from level 1 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.069
 how can it happen with james or with ellis 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.929
 just that his is not a 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.569
 transformation is simply a 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.010
 power movement when using the 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.019
 rest of skills for a while 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.639
 determined or until you use it 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.409
 obviously this has a coulant of 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.030
 45 seconds with which you have to go 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.049
 choosing with a little head what 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.180
 skill you want to empower 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.500
 below and until fortunately has 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.240
 changed a bit because it has changed 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.650
 also its passive 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.329
 the previous page of karma what I was doing 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.710
 that the less life you had the more 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.540
 will increase your ape is changing 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.680
 completely disappeared and now the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.240
 passive karma what it does is and each 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.520
 Once a skill hits the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.259
 enemy reduces the culÃ³n of these mantras 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.509
 of these these power apps of your 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.549
 skills a second instead of soto 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.409
 attack will do 0.5 so 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.939
 they counted blows to an enemy with the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.649
 more skills you can boost 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.149
 because it's down to cool down so 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.799
 well said this I am going to happen to 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.090
 teach then every power up there is with 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.470
 two active the donut gets very 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.689
 happy to him and he gets nervous with the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.830
 way very pissed off and then you have 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.810
 a while you see that the team is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.640
 skills power the unions is 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.929
 there and you know now I'm going to move on 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.159
 show you each skill what 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.509
 does in the normal version and the version 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.039
 boosted because they are pretty 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.400
 changed with respect to the original karma as well 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.930
 let's see how they are 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 or the probability that I will explain 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.410
 is going to be the one that you see has a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.240
 quite generous range either in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.010
 the other world and that reminds quite a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 the cv that is very similar in that 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.670
 aspect only that in this case it hits in 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.650
 area and when it hits the enemies 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.840
 makes a slow of 20 percent during 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.090
 1.5 seconds is the normal version the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.650
 the improved version will see it to the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330
 improved version with mantra as is the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.100
 challenge you want a lightning and make a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.960
 damage in area and in any case not 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.820
 is very careful 6.5 seconds at level 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.020
 2 so it's a core that we can 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.190
 carry a lot and it's going to be the mana cost 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.290
 nor is it too high for what it is 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.209
 a larger area also caused a small 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.980
 is the good the power version of in 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.260
 change is something different does not change 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.720
 too much but what it does is that the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.640
 Slow is greater and also after 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.220
 use this skill as you see are a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.090
 circle on the ground there is and this 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.830
 circle finished born 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.410
 it explodes and makes the year magical so 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.150
 this version then slows down and 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.740
 out for a while that later with a kind 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.240
 of cheating not so to say that who 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.880
 you have it if you pass because when it explodes 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.360
 for an additional year ago that simply 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.360
 what it does 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.730
 and then for the improved version it would come out 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.260
 the special area 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.840
 so a luque with a slogan something 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.459
 pretty basic for a castell apple 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.620
 good in the case of the w too 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.750
 I remember a little bit of a karma canteen 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.790
 these kilos is that it creates a bond between you 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 and an enemy champion only champion no longer 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.989
 you can use it and a year ago 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.760
 for two seconds and if that string does not 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.950
 it breaks that bond does not break let 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.720
 enemy stopped that is not tuned during 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.709
 a few seconds I also think it leaves 1.5 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.940
 that we are in silos therefore the 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.560
 caress of Mars that we like 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.540
 seeing there is such that's why it hurts 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 and then it stops as you see this 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.160
 corner is not tunnel so it's just 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.959
 a rut but good if the damage and the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.340
 version the improved version instead 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.400
 what it does is that it does a little more than 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:43.049
 year and in addition not only hits but 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:46.049
 demented cure for the duration and 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.049
 silence 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.940
 and I also cured myself to provoke 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.239
 that flow so good a little bit 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.700
 more versatile skill 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.639
 and the power because you can heal 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.139
 patient so you're w now by 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.879
 last I will talk about the karma that 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.889
 in this case it is a shield of the version 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.469
 normal what makes this good shield that 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.480
 It also gives a 30% speed of 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.769
 movement for 1.25 seconds and 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.709
 absorbs damage and trains after being a 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.449
 shield see our you put this speed 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.949
 movement and a shield and the truth that 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.570
 this is that I find it very interesting and 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.460
 I think it's going to be one of the most powerful 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.289
 because the enhanced version appeals to me 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.930
 quite as you can see its improved version 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.669
 makes this shield besides doing that 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.830
 hurt around as he did to the 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.160
 previous karma and apply the shield to the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.720
 to the allies that were close that yes 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.460
 only for only half of 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.289
 that shield where not in its entirety but 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.500
 this is very interesting because we can 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.940
 enhance the area with the shield pump 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.770
 I hurt and if there was an ally in 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.240
 that in that range would give you also the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.160
 half of this shield that right now I am 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.229
 level 8 and it's pretty low but 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.400
 imagine in a nymph what can 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.210
 get to do activating what am 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.850
 putting a shield 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.009
 34 people and then putting what 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.569
 I understand the slow etcetera very 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.610
 interesting options and those are the 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.090
 karma skill also tell you what is 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.430
 latest 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.990
 it does not change much when you upload it but 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.639
 what it does do is that it affects 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.620
 what I have read the ratios of other 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.509
 ethereal abilities the powers of 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.490
 indirect way so I do not know until 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.130
 what point that does not have much ap then 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.810
 these shields these islands w is what 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.550
 can do at level 16 with a lot of weight 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.110
 let us discover it because 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.580
 really this load because it's like a 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.199
 new character is something that very little 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.690
 people have explored so I do not expect anything 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.669
 that you enjoy with this new calm this 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.680
 good semi new champion with this record 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.150
 to see if ap support works and 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.949
 the opinions axes remain in the channel of 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.560
 if you think that it has worked better than 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.300
 support the top of ap and so on and nothing 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.889
 subscribe alain I like what to see 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.300
 always and we will not see the vp channel 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.300
 until the next goodbye
