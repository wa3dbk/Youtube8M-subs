00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.420 
s gamer has the engine and chip PS files
so<00:00:53.150> when<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:53.329> open<00:00:53.690> up<00:00:53.840> this<00:00:54.050> flash<00:00:54.800> file<00:00:55.100> I

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
so when I open up this flash file I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.090 
so when I open up this flash file I
noticed<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.390> properties<00:00:56.930> we<00:00:57.920> have

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
noticed that in the properties we have

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.420 
noticed that in the properties we have
this<00:00:58.340> document<00:00:58.970> class<00:00:59.450> called<00:00:59.750> engine

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
this document class called engine

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.639 
this document class called engine
located<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.670> folder<00:01:02.350> this<00:01:03.350> is<00:01:03.500> where

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
located in this folder this is where

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.819 
located in this folder this is where
your<00:01:03.860> code<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.100> starting<00:01:04.840> so<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.930> press<00:01:06.170> ctrl<00:01:06.649> o

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
your code is starting so we press ctrl o

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:12.520 
your code is starting so we press ctrl o
we<00:01:07.490> open<00:01:07.850> up<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.499> actual<00:01:09.499> gamer<00:01:10.310> part<00:01:10.520> 3<00:01:10.789> code

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
we open up the actual gamer part 3 code

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.020 
we open up the actual gamer part 3 code
and<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.520> would<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:13.880> calm<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:15.440> schemer

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
and we would have calm and schemer

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.910 
and we would have calm and schemer
basics<00:01:17.030> one<00:01:17.270> we<00:01:17.660> hold<00:01:17.840> on<00:01:17.990> control<00:01:18.530> click<00:01:18.770> to

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
basics one we hold on control click to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.650 
basics one we hold on control click to
open<00:01:19.250> up<00:01:19.370> both<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.580> these<00:01:19.910> at<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.180> same<00:01:20.360> time

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
open up both of these at the same time

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.250 
open up both of these at the same time
and<00:01:21.940> here<00:01:22.940> we<00:01:23.060> have<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.479> engine<00:01:23.690> code

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.220 

there's<00:01:27.040> nothing<00:01:27.370> new<00:01:27.610> from<00:01:28.030> since<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.080> last

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
there's nothing new from since the last

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.050 
there's nothing new from since the last
time<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:29.890> let's<00:01:30.040> go<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.400> ship<00:01:30.610> code<00:01:30.820> and

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
time so let's go to the ship code and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.890 
time so let's go to the ship code and
see<00:01:31.240> what's<00:01:31.540> new<00:01:31.810> here<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.180> press<00:01:34.480> control

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
see what's new here when I press control

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.990 
see what's new here when I press control
enter<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.290> run<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.800> program<00:01:35.980> notice<00:01:36.730> how<00:01:36.940> we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
enter to run the program notice how we

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.480 
enter to run the program notice how we
have<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.350> spaceship<00:01:38.770> moving<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.370> very

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
have the spaceship moving in a very

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.840 
have the spaceship moving in a very
smooth<00:01:40.000> way<00:01:40.300> so<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.260> feels<00:01:41.530> very<00:01:41.680> smooth<00:01:42.370> as<00:01:42.670> if

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
smooth way so it feels very smooth as if

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.730 
smooth way so it feels very smooth as if
there<00:01:43.060> was<00:01:43.150> some<00:01:43.270> kind<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.510> friction<00:01:43.750> where

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
there was some kind of friction where

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.800 
there was some kind of friction where
it's<00:01:44.860> slowing<00:01:45.130> down<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.700> way<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.150> also

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
it's slowing down that way I also

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.740 
it's slowing down that way I also
noticed<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.470> kind<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:49.270> almost<00:01:49.420> looks

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
noticed this kind of it almost looks

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.890 
noticed this kind of it almost looks
like<00:01:49.810> it's<00:01:50.110> rotating<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.130> some<00:01:51.430> in<00:01:52.120> some<00:01:52.600> cool

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
like it's rotating in some in some cool

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.470 
like it's rotating in some in some cool
animation<00:01:53.800> way<00:01:54.520> let's<00:01:54.820> see<00:01:54.970> what's<00:01:55.120> going<00:01:55.330> on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
animation way let's see what's going on

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.030 
animation way let's see what's going on
there<00:01:57.750> notice<00:01:58.750> how<00:01:59.050> we<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.230> some<00:01:59.530> variables

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
there notice how we have some variables

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.770 
there notice how we have some variables
here<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.520> V<00:02:00.700> X<00:02:00.970> velocity<00:02:01.420> X<00:02:02.020> V<00:02:02.350> Y<00:02:02.380> velocity<00:02:02.650> Y

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
here and V X velocity X V Y velocity Y

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.310 
here and V X velocity X V Y velocity Y
friction<00:02:04.780> as<00:02:04.990> well<00:02:05.440> as<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> maximum<00:02:06.370> speed<00:02:07.320> so

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
friction as well as a maximum speed so

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.760 
friction as well as a maximum speed so
when<00:02:08.530> we<00:02:08.649> actually<00:02:09.720> depress<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.290> left<00:02:11.500> arrow

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
when we actually depress the left arrow

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.150 
when we actually depress the left arrow
button

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
button

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.050 
button
our<00:02:13.150> velocity<00:02:13.510> X<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.350> gonna<00:02:14.530> decrease<00:02:15.340> by

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
our velocity X is gonna decrease by

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.410 
our velocity X is gonna decrease by
speed<00:02:16.870> amount<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.400> line<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> same<00:02:19.240> as

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
speed amount so this line is the same as

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.840 
speed amount so this line is the same as
saying<00:02:19.600> velocity<00:02:20.200> X<00:02:20.620> equals<00:02:21.160> velocity<00:02:21.310> X

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
saying velocity X equals velocity X

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.150 
saying velocity X equals velocity X
minus<00:02:22.270> speed<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.760> wanted<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.240> decrease

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
minus speed so if you wanted to decrease

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.580 
minus speed so if you wanted to decrease
real<00:02:27.160> quickly<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.180> simply

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
real quickly you would just simply

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.060 
real quickly you would just simply
increase<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:30.040> number<00:02:30.370> here<00:02:32.040> remember<00:02:33.040> that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
increase this number here remember that

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.030 
increase this number here remember that
this<00:02:33.400> loop<00:02:34.030> function<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.870> being<00:02:35.050> called<00:02:35.140> every

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
this loop function is being called every

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.900 
this loop function is being called every
single<00:02:36.490> frame<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:38.160> every<00:02:39.160> single<00:02:39.459> frame<00:02:39.730> is

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
single frame so every single frame is

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.550 
single frame so every single frame is
gonna<00:02:40.090> keep<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.510> checking<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.990> see<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:41.410> your

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
gonna keep on checking to see if your

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.340 
gonna keep on checking to see if your
left<00:02:42.370> key<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.760> down<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.930> keep<00:02:44.200> on

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
left key is down so if you keep on

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.650 
left key is down so if you keep on
holding<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.920> certain<00:02:45.190> key<00:02:45.430> direction<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.540> then

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
holding a certain key direction and then

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.850 
holding a certain key direction and then
we're<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.989> keep<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.500> affecting<00:02:48.100> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
we're going to keep on affecting the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.410 
we're going to keep on affecting the
axis<00:02:50.860> velocity

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
axis velocity

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.530 
axis velocity
and<00:02:54.260> notice<00:02:54.620> how<00:02:54.800> if<00:02:55.130> we<00:02:55.190> are<00:02:55.670> not<00:02:56.150> pressing

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
and notice how if we are not pressing

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.130 
and notice how if we are not pressing
left<00:02:56.990> or<00:02:57.830> right<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.450> alternative

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
left or right then the alternative

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.330 
left or right then the alternative
situation<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.970> should<00:03:02.209> somehow<00:03:04.150> slow<00:03:05.150> down

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
situation is we should somehow slow down

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.550 
situation is we should somehow slow down
so<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.580> exes<00:03:08.260> velocity<00:03:09.260> be<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.180> positive<00:03:11.180> or

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
so the exes velocity be it positive or

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.060 
so the exes velocity be it positive or
negative<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:14.540> going<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:15.110> decrease<00:03:15.590> because

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
negative it's going to decrease because

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.630 
negative it's going to decrease because
when<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.640> multiply<00:03:17.650> itself<00:03:18.650> by<00:03:19.100> friction

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
when you multiply itself by friction

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.690 
when you multiply itself by friction
which<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:19.940> 0.93<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.860> going<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.100> decrease<00:03:22.280> by

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
which is 0.93 it's going to decrease by

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.140 
which is 0.93 it's going to decrease by
about<00:03:22.730> seven<00:03:23.239> percent<00:03:23.420> every<00:03:23.900> time<00:03:24.140> VX<00:03:25.150> x

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
about seven percent every time VX x

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.020 
about seven percent every time VX x
equals<00:03:26.810> friction<00:03:27.440> means<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:28.459> same<00:03:28.700> thing<00:03:28.880> as

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
equals friction means the same thing as

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.770 
equals friction means the same thing as
VX<00:03:29.510> equals<00:03:29.900> VX<00:03:30.350> times<00:03:30.830> friction<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.480> we<00:03:32.600> keep

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
VX equals VX times friction so we keep

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.250 
VX equals VX times friction so we keep
decreasing<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.950> VX<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:35.450> become<00:03:35.720> smaller<00:03:36.050> and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
decreasing the VX and become smaller and

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.850 
decreasing the VX and become smaller and
smaller

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
smaller

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.000 
smaller
hence<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.780> effect<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.739> whatever

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
hence the the effect of the you whatever

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.000 
hence the the effect of the you whatever
the<00:03:40.190> VX<00:03:40.489> speeds<00:03:41.420> tends<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.019> slow<00:03:42.320> down<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
the VX speeds tends to slow down and

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.290 
the VX speeds tends to slow down and
decelerate<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.739> same<00:03:45.739> code<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.340> for<00:03:46.760> moving

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
decelerate the same code is for moving

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.500 
decelerate the same code is for moving
up<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.720> down<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.860> it's<00:03:49.700> interesting<00:03:50.000> here

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
up and down and it's interesting here

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.340 
up and down and it's interesting here
that<00:03:50.540> x<00:03:51.310> equals<00:03:52.310> x<00:03:52.550> plus<00:03:52.670> VX<00:03:53.480> plus<00:03:53.870> y<00:03:53.900> equals

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
that x equals x plus VX plus y equals

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.460 
that x equals x plus VX plus y equals
means<00:03:54.560> x<00:03:54.950> equals<00:03:55.310> x<00:03:55.459> plus<00:03:55.550> VX<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:57.019> it's<00:03:57.200> kind<00:03:57.410> of

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
means x equals x plus VX so it's kind of

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.710 
means x equals x plus VX so it's kind of
like<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> change<00:03:57.980> in<00:03:58.160> X<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:59.329> can<00:03:59.480> be<00:03:59.510> either

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
like the change in X it can be either

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.810 
like the change in X it can be either
positive<00:03:59.840> or<00:04:00.440> negative<00:04:00.500> same<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.640> Y's

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
positive or negative same with the Y's

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.780 
positive or negative same with the Y's
so<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:03.079> X<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.650> blue<00:04:03.950> why<00:04:04.310> isn't<00:04:04.640> blue

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
so the X is in blue why isn't blue

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.550 
so the X is in blue why isn't blue
rotations<00:04:05.450> in<00:04:05.630> blue<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.079> means<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.470> a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
rotations in blue it means it's a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.560 
rotations in blue it means it's a
special<00:04:06.980> property<00:04:07.430> that's<00:04:07.579> built<00:04:07.850> into<00:04:08.090> flash

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
special property that's built into flash

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.759 
special property that's built into flash
and<00:04:09.140> these<00:04:09.890> properties<00:04:10.690> belong<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.410> the

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
and these properties belong to the the

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.860 
and these properties belong to the the
actual<00:04:13.040> movie<00:04:13.400> clip<00:04:13.640> since<00:04:13.880> ship<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.690> ship

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
actual movie clip since ship the ship

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.349 
actual movie clip since ship the ship
class<00:04:15.079> is<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.350> movie<00:04:15.650> clip<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.549> all<00:04:16.760> movie<00:04:17.090> clips

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
class is a movie clip so all movie clips

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.469 
class is a movie clip so all movie clips
have<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.840> property<00:04:18.260> called<00:04:18.440> X<00:04:18.769> Y<00:04:19.340> M<00:04:19.880> rotation

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
have this property called X Y M rotation

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.550 
have this property called X Y M rotation
and<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:21.739> happens<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:23.560> ship

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
and it just so happens that this ship

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.700 
and it just so happens that this ship
movie<00:04:25.070> clip<00:04:25.570> rotates

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
movie clip rotates

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.550 
movie clip rotates
every<00:04:28.460> single<00:04:29.650> frame<00:04:30.910> depending<00:04:31.910> on<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.570> the

exes VX value which can be either
negative<00:04:38.360> or<00:04:38.389> positive<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.289> it<00:04:39.410> can<00:04:39.500> rotate<00:04:39.620> a

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
negative or positive so it can rotate a

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.779 
negative or positive so it can rotate a

the<00:04:51.440> code<00:04:51.650> is<00:04:51.979> set<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.280> 8

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
the code is set to 8

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.939 
the code is set to 8
we're<00:04:53.300> just<00:04:53.449> somehow<00:04:53.630> capping<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.470> maximum

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
we're just somehow capping the maximum

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.590 
we're just somehow capping the maximum
speed<00:04:55.630> change<00:04:57.280> as<00:04:58.280> well<00:04:58.639> as<00:04:58.850> here<00:04:59.300> we're<00:04:59.570> just

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
speed change as well as here we're just

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.210 
speed change as well as here we're just
like<00:05:00.050> capping<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.590> minimum<00:05:01.479> XV<00:05:02.479> exit<00:05:02.870> speed

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
like capping the minimum XV exit speed

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.180 
like capping the minimum XV exit speed
and<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.520> same<00:05:04.729> idea<00:05:05.060> over<00:05:05.150> here<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.860> here<00:05:07.100> it

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
and the same idea over here and here it

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.189 
and the same idea over here and here it
looks<00:05:07.340> like<00:05:07.449> developer<00:05:08.449> just<00:05:08.600> played<00:05:08.930> around

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
looks like developer just played around

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.550 
looks like developer just played around
with<00:05:09.430> tweaking<00:05:10.430> some<00:05:10.669> some<00:05:11.419> algorithms<00:05:12.229> here

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
with tweaking some some algorithms here

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.100 
with tweaking some some algorithms here
this<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.520> not<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.910> only<00:05:14.060> outcome<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.690> can<00:05:14.900> use

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
this is not the only outcome you can use

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.140 
this is not the only outcome you can use
but<00:05:15.440> he<00:05:15.919> just<00:05:16.100> messed<00:05:16.280> around<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.789> found<00:05:17.000> this

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
but he just messed around and found this

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.480 
but he just messed around and found this
to<00:05:17.330> be<00:05:17.360> visually<00:05:17.870> appealing<00:05:18.250> somehow<00:05:19.250> we're

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
to be visually appealing somehow we're

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.390 
to be visually appealing somehow we're
changing<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.150> scale<00:05:20.449> X<00:05:20.720> property<00:05:20.990> if<00:05:21.830> you

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
changing the scale X property if you

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.900 
changing the scale X property if you
change<00:05:22.789> the<00:05:23.150> scale<00:05:23.360> X<00:05:23.630> property<00:05:24.910> which

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
change the scale X property which

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.350 
change the scale X property which
somehow<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.539> depends<00:05:26.930> on<00:05:27.050> VX<00:05:27.639> it<00:05:28.639> can<00:05:28.849> be

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
somehow it depends on VX it can be

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.839 
somehow it depends on VX it can be
visually<00:05:29.810> pleasing<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:31.130> idea<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.580> increasing

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
visually pleasing the idea of increasing

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.480 
visually pleasing the idea of increasing
the<00:05:32.150> scale<00:05:32.389> X<00:05:32.630> twice<00:05:33.470> is<00:05:33.680> why<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:33.889> would<00:05:34.250> make

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
the scale X twice is why it would make

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.290 
the scale X twice is why it would make
your<00:05:34.699> ship<00:05:34.970> be<00:05:35.660> twice<00:05:35.930> as<00:05:36.380> wide<00:05:37.180> if<00:05:38.180> you

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
your ship be twice as wide if you

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.879 
your ship be twice as wide if you
multiply<00:05:38.660> by<00:05:38.810> two<00:05:38.870> and<00:05:39.289> if<00:05:39.349> you<00:05:39.440> divide<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
multiply by two and if you divide the

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.129 
multiply by two and if you divide the
scale<00:05:40.130> X<00:05:40.310> finally<00:05:40.699> by<00:05:40.849> two<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.720> would<00:05:41.810> be<00:05:41.960> twice

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
scale X finally by two it would be twice

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.250 
scale X finally by two it would be twice
as<00:05:42.349> skinny<00:05:42.650> if<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.760> make<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.060> scale<00:05:44.449> X<00:05:44.690> value

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
as skinny if you make a scale X value

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.950 
as skinny if you make a scale X value
negative<00:05:45.680> it'll<00:05:46.250> actually<00:05:46.460> flip<00:05:47.150> the

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
negative it'll actually flip the

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.460 
negative it'll actually flip the
spaceship<00:05:48.470> image<00:05:48.860> horizontally<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:51.080> here<00:05:51.320> are

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
spaceship image horizontally so here are

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.710 
spaceship image horizontally so here are
the<00:05:51.650> main<00:05:51.800> ideas<00:05:51.979> from<00:05:52.639> this<00:05:52.880> part<00:05:53.240> three<00:05:53.449> code

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
the main ideas from this part three code

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.360 
the main ideas from this part three code
hopefully<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:54.830> can<00:05:55.010> digest<00:05:55.490> and

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
hopefully you can digest and

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.190 
hopefully you can digest and
have<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:58.030> creative<00:05:58.390> power<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.870> create<00:05:59.110> your

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
have the creative power to create your

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.790 
have the creative power to create your
own<00:05:59.260> games<00:05:59.790> excellent
