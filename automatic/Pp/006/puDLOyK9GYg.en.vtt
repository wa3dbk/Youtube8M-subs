it actually fall to the second time at

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
it actually fall to the second time at
MLG<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> doesn't<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:16.049> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
MLG that kind of doesn't think you

should you would be able to put it on
the<00:01:17.520> back<00:01:17.640> burner<00:01:17.670> i<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.689> had<00:01:18.930> ash

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the back burner i think if they had ash

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.080 
the back burner i think if they had ash
in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.799> second<00:01:20.070> game<00:01:20.159> rather<00:01:20.369> than<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
in the second game rather than the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
in the second game rather than the
Barras<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.900> won<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> game<00:01:22.580> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Barras they would have won that game so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
Barras they would have won that game so
this<00:01:24.000> game<00:01:24.240> again<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> fastest

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this game again not one of the fastest

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
with the aggressive strategy after the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.700 
with the aggressive strategy after the
30-minute<00:01:36.659> usually<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.990> guys<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.320> average<00:01:37.590> i

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
30-minute usually you guys are average i

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
30-minute usually you guys are average i
think<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.400> 28<00:01:38.729> minutes

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
think right now I was like 28 minutes

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
think right now I was like 28 minutes
really<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> depends<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.740> how<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> game

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
really just depends on how the game

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.340 
really just depends on how the game
flows<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> big<00:01:42.479> lead<00:01:42.600> beauty<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
flows if you get a big lead beauty and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
flows if you get a big lead beauty and
its<00:01:43.470> strong<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.399> 20<00:01:45.149> minutes<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
its strong and just 20 minutes like you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
its strong and just 20 minutes like you
said<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.250> ended<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.909> dying<00:01:48.540> all

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
said but if we ended up like dying all

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
said but if we ended up like dying all
over<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> place<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> getting<00:01:49.619> picked<00:01:49.860> off<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
over the place and getting picked off it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.069 
over the place and getting picked off it
just<00:01:50.490> delays<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> whole<00:01:51.149> game<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.479> ending<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
just delays the whole game and ending it

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.499 
just delays the whole game and ending it
so<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> only<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:53.909> losses<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so with the only two losses that you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.359 
so with the only two losses that you
guys<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.350> did<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> learn<00:01:55.740> most<00:01:56.070> about

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
all over the place and couldn't really

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.969 
all over the place and couldn't really
recover<00:02:07.979> from<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:09.209> CLG<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:10.200> kind

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
recover from that and then CLG was kind

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.309 
recover from that and then CLG was kind
of<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> same<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.370> had<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.610> bad<00:02:11.760> level

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
of the same we had a really bad level

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.489 
of the same we had a really bad level
that<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.739> screwed<00:02:13.670> us<00:02:13.760> over<00:02:13.879> really<00:02:14.480> hard<00:02:14.629> so

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:15.499 
that just screwed us over really hard so

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.750 
that just screwed us over really hard so
what<00:02:15.620> does<00:02:15.709> practice<00:02:16.099> become<00:02:16.430> for<00:02:16.639> those

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
what does practice become for those

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.059 
what does practice become for those
obviously<00:02:17.299> that<00:02:17.810> easy<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.200> just<00:02:18.319> make<00:02:18.859> well

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
obviously that easy to just make well

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.709 
obviously that easy to just make well
that<00:02:19.189> level<00:02:19.549> one<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.939> happen<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.450> play<00:02:20.599> it

that will never happen and stuff like
that<00:02:24.560> yeah<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.579> lot<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.939> our<00:02:26.030> screams<00:02:26.299> have

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
that yeah a lot of our screams have

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.550 
that yeah a lot of our screams have
actually<00:02:26.810> been<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.019> less<00:02:27.230> than<00:02:27.409> five

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
actually been like less than five

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.080 
actually been like less than five
minutes<00:02:27.769> just<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.280> practicing<00:02:28.730> level<00:02:28.969> ones

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090

things like that so we've been improving

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.179 
things like that so we've been improving
that<00:02:44.090> as<00:02:44.180> much<00:02:44.299> as<00:02:44.389> we<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.599> what<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.980> for

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
that as much as we can what is that for

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.009 
that as much as we can what is that for
you<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.549> map<00:02:46.879> control<00:02:47.359> is<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.689> getting

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
you is that map control is that getting

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.420 
you is that map control is that getting
the<00:02:48.109> pics<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.439> want<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.799> certain<00:02:48.980> lane<00:02:49.250> or

figured<00:02:51.079> out<00:02:51.139> that<00:02:51.199> that<00:02:51.379> formula<00:02:51.829> works<00:02:52.419> it's

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
figured out that that formula works it's

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.229 
figured out that that formula works it's
mainly<00:02:53.719> just<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.730> before<00:02:55.730> they<00:02:56.030> kind<00:02:56.209> of

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
mainly just like before they kind of

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.729 
mainly just like before they kind of
knew<00:02:56.419> where<00:02:56.810> we'd<00:02:56.959> go<00:02:57.109> with<00:02:57.230> everyone<00:02:57.500> with

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
knew where we'd go with everyone with

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.479 
knew where we'd go with everyone with
our<00:02:57.859> words<00:02:57.980> because<00:02:58.250> we're<00:02:58.340> kind<00:02:58.459> of

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
our words because we're kind of

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.879 
our words because we're kind of
predictable<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.199> so<00:03:00.199> we<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.769> like

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
predictable and so we just kind of like

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.610 
predictable and so we just kind of like
mix<00:03:01.159> that<00:03:01.280> up<00:03:01.340> get<00:03:01.669> some<00:03:01.849> more<00:03:01.969> straps<00:03:02.239> out<00:03:02.620> and
