00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 very well spent for this competitor in 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.740
 revenge on the few hesitations that 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.330
 goes with the number one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.370
 takes advantage it's rocky hall that 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.870
 takes the best with the number 3 rod 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.370
 stewart associated with jean-michel bazire 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.719
 it's an italian but with jean michel 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.490
 expensive bazire believe that you are in fact 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 it's the big favorite to actually take 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.850
 a catch that had half melted 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.100
 pop and melted in half in second 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 position number one is rock and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.369
 hydraulic is ranked well number 12 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.350
 is in the head group also 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 as we try to progress then 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 with that everything outside number 8 he 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.490
 is the actor dumouchel hexa that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.750
 red 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.070
 she left jean michel bazire he has 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.149
 took a few lengths of advanced but he 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.590
 is a Frenchman who approaches these 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.910
 actors dumouchel the number 8 that comes 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 practically second position with 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.750
 also rock'n'roll rope number 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.070
 one as to franck nivard he is still 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.270
 in trouble the first part of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.100
 course is a bit difficult for a 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.059
 goal of thil or number 7 which is is recovering 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.739
 in the right cadence is first neither 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.910
 opposite we see the care of fabrice 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 souloy who takes the advantage 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.000
 we are far away with the nero and we are far 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.340
 with the 6 also 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.629
 the 5 is disqualified but continues the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.579
 race or giving for now a little 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.109
 of regret it goes quickly with matthieu 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 abrivard who decided to accelerate 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.800
 dryly with a dumouchel actor with 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.420

 favorite dojo and that's to redo a 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.290
 little difficult terrain one is 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.970
 informed of the arrival with jean-michel 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.800
 matter of rock music that we know the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.840
 rope that will not resist give to 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.660

 jude artists on arrival who is 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.680
 composed of Italian horses in this price 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.470
 leopold verroken with the victory that has 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.760
 been hotly contested between rod stewart and 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.070
 rude and we saw jean michel bazire 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.960
 in a very uncomfortable position 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.790
 forbade something stops it was 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.410
 lost serena I think he lost his 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.210
 rival he lost his answer to vote at 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.100
 right he certainly won I believe 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.980
 he won anyway looking for his 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.160
 queen they all three 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.170
 currently 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.610
 there is a half closed he said yes 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.680
 because if reindeer gaps you know 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.270
 how much stone is holding his horse 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.640
 currently at the exit of the turning 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.960
 of news is astonished that is from jean michel 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.760
 bazire who will be able to get off the 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:21.350
 horse thank you but he misses a queen 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.060
 Here he lost that right and he 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.680
 won anyway it's amazing this 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.350
 here he will have done everything on the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.450
 gas he resisted to the end 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.220
 there he goes to see he 'll be able to see the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.380
 smile but in my opinion v it does 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.400
 bankrupt the pasta comfortable you know 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.750
 when you saw that happened to me 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.930
 time to have an ongoing queen on 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.700
 not good jean philippe who goes to the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.610
 subtle of jean michel bazire we go all 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.560
 namely certainly not end the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.430
 big crowd and he joins jean michel 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.430
 mazet we listen to jean phi 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.560
 I
