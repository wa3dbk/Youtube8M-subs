00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.540
 welcome back and yes very short 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.190
 intro video decided over 100 likes 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.570
 I will soon whey a few 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.570
 introduce proteins 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.160
 or test them for you 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.189
 but end effect would be whey proteins 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
 I currently use or the chance 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.789
 I have used and for good 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 felt but it remains so all 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.829
 things that I will show you are 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 good means you can buy them and it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.100
 is and is important to a pure 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.110
 subjective recommendation involve 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.660
 it has a subjective test so it has like 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.789
 I feel it is what I use for my 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 see needs as good or bad 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.300
 and so on and so on now 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.579
 not really a thing like that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.980
 the motto yes , I should that to me 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 profile of products from across the board 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.579
 Products with price performance in comparison 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.140
 what better does it know i'm worse 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.369
 but there are enough incredible ones like you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.340
 yes I do not have any here now 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.380
 Sale great videos make such 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.159
 so to seek the best of it what it is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.650
 not anyway 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.869
 yes because only one is very important 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.909
 dietary supplements and im 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.000
 end effect for the otto normal consumer 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.790
 For all amateur athletes it does not matter if 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.549
 we now at product a 5 grams more bca 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.520
 it has as a byproduct b because by the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.420
 Nutrition actually in perfection 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090
 should have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.619
 Do you already have everything you need? 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.600
 In the end it does not matter much 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.770
 At least that's me, of course 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.680
 says it is more important in me 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.630
 product b more or 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.729
 that makes it ok for me it is not a thing 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.070
 visa is my own opinion yes 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
 I will have my own criteria with the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.810
 I test the things and you always have 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.890
 the possibility of course yours 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.540
 own experience reports with 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.920
 if you say so when I am 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.360
 example sage products has with taste 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 xy tasted great and you say 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.590
 then I do not think so the shares 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 bought and then said boy was for 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.489
 I rather puke 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.500
 then it is so yes so as said that 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.030
 my criteria 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.090
 which ones would like and that granted 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.690
 it was only for a very short time 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.570
 and then it was actually already 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.220
 look how was I short that was it from 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.220
 nothing better to me
