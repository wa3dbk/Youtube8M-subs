00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.200 
right back okay checked all the fuses up
underneath<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.640> actually<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
underneath here and this actually is

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
underneath here and this actually is
here<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> low<00:01:55.710> beam<00:01:55.950> relay<00:01:56.399> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
here right here is a low beam relay this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.880 
here right here is a low beam relay this
is<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> relay<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.270> inside<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.890> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
is the relay right inside here this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
is the relay right inside here this
relay<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> good<00:02:00.210> shape<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.990> so

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
relay is actually in good shape also so

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
relay is actually in good shape also so
what<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> fuses<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.149> good<00:02:03.420> we

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
what we know that the fuses are good we

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
what we know that the fuses are good we
know<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> relay<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.680> good<00:02:04.890> we're<00:02:05.610> going

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
know that the relay is good we're going

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
know that the relay is good we're going
to<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.880> inside<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.079> well

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to go inside now and we're going to well

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.990 
to go inside now and we're going to well
let's<00:02:08.069> pull<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.280> switch<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
let's pull that switch out of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.510 
let's pull that switch out of the
dashboard<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.629> we'll<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.099> what<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> looks

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
dashboard and we'll see what that looks

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
dashboard and we'll see what that looks
like<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.000> let's<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.660> inside<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.290> we'll<00:02:13.560> get

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
like so let's go inside and we'll get

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.010 
like so let's go inside and we'll get
started<00:02:13.890> okay<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.720> switch

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
started okay this is the the switch

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.900 
started okay this is the the switch
assembly<00:02:19.680> right<00:02:20.280> here<00:02:20.489> we're<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.819> be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
assembly right here we're going to be

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.130 
assembly right here we're going to be
changed<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.690> here<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.900> actually

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
changed and this one here is actually

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.970 
changed and this one here is actually
fairly<00:02:22.680> easy<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.819> remove<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.470> would<00:02:25.650> think

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
fairly easy to remove you would think

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.350 
fairly easy to remove you would think
that<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that you would get in here with the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.089 
that you would get in here with the
screwdriver<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.200> would<00:02:28.349> pry<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.650> plate

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
screwdriver and you would pry this plate

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.220 
screwdriver and you would pry this plate
off<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.580> would<00:02:29.730> remove<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.930> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
off and you would remove it if you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.880 
off and you would remove it if you
thought<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.950> would<00:02:32.129> actually<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.760> wrong

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
thought that you would actually be wrong

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.680 
thought that you would actually be wrong
the<00:02:34.890> way<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.129> do<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.360> through

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the way you do it is you go in through

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.570 
the way you do it is you go in through
the<00:02:36.870> opening<00:02:37.349> here<00:02:38.120> where<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:40.550> where<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the opening here where the where the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.040 
the opening here where the where the
fuse<00:02:42.150> box<00:02:42.830> panel<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.720> you'll<00:02:45.720> feel<00:02:45.989> a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
fuse box panel is and you'll feel a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:56.839 
fuse box panel is and you'll feel a
little<00:02:46.319> clip<00:02:47.030> inside<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:55.370> as<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.610> push

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
little clip inside that you as you push

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.440 
little clip inside that you as you push
up<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.569> bail<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.769> at<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> same<00:02:59.250> same<00:02:59.819> time<00:02:59.849> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
up and bail on at the same same time and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.199 
up and bail on at the same same time and
it<00:03:01.200> push<00:03:01.409> it<00:03:01.440> right<00:03:01.739> out<00:03:01.800> I'll<00:03:02.790> show<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.120> how

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.910 
it push it right out I'll show you how
that<00:03:03.239> goes<00:03:03.629> there<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.769> clip<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:07.890> I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
that goes there this is the clip so I

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
push this down here at the same time you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.649 
push this down here at the same time you
push<00:03:13.769> these<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.190> together<00:03:14.480> while<00:03:15.480> it's

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
push these two together while it's

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.680 
push these two together while it's
inside<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.170> dashboard<00:03:16.409> here<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:18.450> pops

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
inside the dashboard here and it pops

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.190 
inside the dashboard here and it pops
right<00:03:18.810> out

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
right out

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.770

alright so let me get a test light and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.890 
alright so let me get a test light and
we'll<00:03:21.930> go<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.280> we're<00:03:23.280> going<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.489> test<00:03:25.340> this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
we'll go to we're going to test this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.119 
we'll go to we're going to test this

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
we're going to test this switch to to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.509 
we're going to test this switch to to
make<00:03:32.610> sure<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:34.769> okay<00:03:36.890> actually<00:03:37.890> you

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
and what I did is I just took this box

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.430 
and what I did is I just took this box
out<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.130> tapped<00:04:03.490> on<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:04.090> should<00:04:05.050> say<00:04:05.080> took

take a gamble and we're going to try
changing<00:04:57.660> this<00:04:57.960> here<00:04:58.140> being<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.650> we<00:04:58.830> took

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
changing this here being that we took

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.580 
changing this here being that we took
this<00:04:59.910> out<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.330> just<00:05:00.570> tapped<00:05:00.810> on<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.080> little<00:05:01.440> bit

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
this out and just tapped on a little bit

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.770 
this out and just tapped on a little bit
the<00:05:01.740> headlights<00:05:02.070> came<00:05:02.370> on<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:03.300> kind<00:05:03.480> of<00:05:03.600> leads

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780

the headlights came on it kind of leads
me<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.960> believe<00:05:04.170> that<00:05:04.350> this<00:05:04.770> switch<00:05:05.040> is<00:05:05.250> going

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
me to believe that this switch is going

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.560 
me to believe that this switch is going
to<00:05:05.490> be<00:05:05.580> no<00:05:05.760> good<00:05:05.790> so<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:07.620> looks<00:05:07.890> like<00:05:07.950> it's

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
to be no good so this looks like it's

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.420 
to be no good so this looks like it's
going<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.660> have<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.900> be<00:05:09.990> on<00:05:10.170> it<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:10.680> let<00:05:11.130> me<00:05:11.220> grab

going to have to be on it so let me grab
