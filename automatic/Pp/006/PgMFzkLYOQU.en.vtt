we're<00:00:02.190> often<00:00:02.310> faced<00:00:02.820> with<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.389> paradox<00:00:03.929> when<00:00:04.110> we

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
we're often faced with a paradox when we

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.220 
we're often faced with a paradox when we
design<00:00:04.730> to<00:00:05.730> make<00:00:05.879> products<00:00:06.390> smaller<00:00:06.839> and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
design to make products smaller and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.950 
design to make products smaller and
lighter<00:00:07.550> while<00:00:08.550> at<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.700> same<00:00:08.940> time<00:00:09.000> more

becomes to increase its power and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.640 
becomes to increase its power and
maintain<00:00:18.000> its<00:00:18.240> battery<00:00:18.600> life<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.170> if<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.470> can
