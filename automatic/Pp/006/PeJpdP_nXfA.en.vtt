figures<00:00:08.160> all<00:00:08.309> right<00:00:08.429> I've<00:00:08.490> got<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> pretty<00:00:08.910> big

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
figures all right I've got a pretty big

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.669 
figures all right I've got a pretty big
advantage<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.719> should<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
advantage I should have this one in the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.400 
advantage I should have this one in the
bag<00:00:10.889> until<00:00:11.160> he<00:00:11.849> realizes<00:00:12.269> he's<00:00:12.660> low<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.139> nice

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410

that's<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.580> if<00:00:47.699> he<00:00:47.790> had<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.420> more

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690

that's right if he had just one more
knife<00:00:48.989> he<00:00:49.260> probably<00:00:49.620> would<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.040> won<00:00:50.250> that

knife he probably would have won that
damn<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.690> expensive<00:00:51.930> mistake

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
damn that is one expensive mistake

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.340 
damn that is one expensive mistake
meanwhile<00:00:53.910> wand<00:00:54.330> has<00:00:54.660> discovered<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.199> rather

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
meanwhile wand has discovered a rather

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.380 
meanwhile wand has discovered a rather
interesting<00:00:55.770> technique<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> winning<00:00:57.059> every

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
interesting technique to winning every

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.060 
interesting technique to winning every

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
stake in the duel arena and since this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
stake in the duel arena and since this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
clip gets pretty intense I'm going to go

00:01:00.480 --> 00:02:00.610 
clip gets pretty intense I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.840> cut<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.110> background<00:01:01.530> music
