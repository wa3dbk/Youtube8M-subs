00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 in the space of one hectare of land in tea 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.280
 great county of pernambuco father son 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.710
 take care of planting one gherkin 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.620
 trend in green bark format 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.199
 ovals have small soft spines and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.960
 non-pointed seeds 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 the culture does not give much 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 work to be first cultivated 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.359
 thing to do is prepare the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.400
 earth leaves the earth clean or with no 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.500
 kind of future that even the kind of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.690
 dilemma did not settle down and came to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 fetaep the planting there we make it clean 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.489
 was was all the capture and plant 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.610
 I'm about 30 days old. 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.370
 there begins the harvest the planting is done 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.590
 usually in the winter time the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.899
 and adapts well to the weather and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.329
 result in a good harvest the choice of 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.430
 investment of vegetables is not only 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.339
 due to fast cycle and good adaptation 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.610
 to the climate totally where it grows in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.740
 chuchu vegetable garden and there it is 11 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.229
 that he arrives fast and he 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.290
 also ends quickly so give some time 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.880
 so that the crop of the chuchu can 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 grow and can develop without 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 no problem 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.869
 So we cultivate more of this life. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.329
 the caterpillar and the ant are 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.479
 some handles that hinder the planting 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.030
 to try to stop them and save the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.070
 gherkin farmers make use of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.850
 we use agrochemicals 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.939
 catholic fought in addition to neco is due 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.189
 to the ant that it causes of this legend of the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.710
 maxixe ends up delaying them in trying 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.350
 to reduce the use of chemicals 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.869
 used by farmers 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.509
 the agronomic institute of pernambuco has 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.979
 a project to implant new practices 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.390
 there are numerous agroecological practices 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.520
 which can be used by 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.710
 agriculture, including those in the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.869
 cow or shock a harmony background 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.989
 among other leaves of the plant 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 are getting yellowish selmir 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.440
 states that the reason is due to the sun but 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 diagnosis can only be given after a 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.310
 soil analysis the fire was observed 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.710
 by farmers the climatic factor and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.840
 greatly interferes with the burning of leaves 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.230
 but it would be advisable to make analysis 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.540
 of solo to tickle corrections 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.880
 marketing is done through 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.290
 resellers who resell the product in the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.720
 reef ceasa 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.650
 the price of a certain one with 15 kilos can 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.150
 between 5 and 17 reais depending on the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.880
 market demand 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.460
 even with this price irregularity 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.380
 of the other cultures that end up 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.050
 making life difficult for the man of the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.480
 field his love's father that valmir 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.420
 has worked in these lands for more 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.160
 You can not imagine doing anything else. 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.920
 I like the country here. 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.430
 to agriculture, and I will not go
