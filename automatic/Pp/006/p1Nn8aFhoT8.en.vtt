00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.750
 Hello dear friends and today I 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.730
 would like to talk with you about 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 such wonderful tanks as 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.849
 French heavy tank 6 level arl 44 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.930
 generally sitting down a branch of the French 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 heavy tanks I first of all wanted 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.579
 turn off exactly mx 50 100 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.600
 Well, as I think most of those who 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.610
 sits down for pumping this branch and not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.589
 expected to meet me on the way 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.220
 some interesting tanchiki 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.190
 and that's when I deflated arl 44 it to me 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.140
 seemed rather strange 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.140
 strange precisely because he 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.530
 french and because he 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.789
 armored thing is that rather 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 altogether how I think in the fortieth year 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.920
 when they started designing this tank 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.920
 France has almost occupied 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 Germany and apparently just supplies 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.990
 famous french cardboard somehow 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.170
 trimmed and still french tank 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.020
 builders had to use 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.659
 metal armor plates in the making 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.450
 I don't even know how to explain the tanks 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.500
 the fact that in the frontal projection is a tank 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.470
 very much protected wld y 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.720
 it is 120 millimeters nld 50 millimeters 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 but under the same tea scheme corners it 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.530
 so small that its practically 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.500
 don't select tower 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.349
 also ok if you donâ€™t take of course 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.340
 stock tower to the word here this one 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:54.330
 stock squirrel he was produced 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.149
 just the same after the top tower but 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.599
 the game, the top soil tower is being pumped out 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.429
 as though in terms of history was first here 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.860
 it is exactly the top tower 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.869
 and then came up with this one 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.470
 skvoreshnik to shove 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.470
 there are huge 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.370
 guns so here was up to 120 millimeters 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.040
 at an angle of 50 degrees gives us in 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.500
 given 187 millimeters but self 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.980
 yourself there if you are a little lower 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.920
 the opponent it will be easier to break through 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.030
 if a little higher then the angle of the reduced armor 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.020
 already a bit more positive and there are possible and 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.720
 bounce and non penetration well in general 187 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.450
 given ki is pretty good for 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.600
 level six given the fact that in our 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.360
 The game most popular tanks 6 level and 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.570
 judging by my experience riding sixes 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 well of except for monkeys somewhere in 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.660
 60 percent of the battles you get just to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610
 sixth level and 20 percent to 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.760
 sevens and eights if you do not 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.350
 stripped down fights level and you get to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.860
 sevens and eights here is the top tower 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.640
 his tower is also well protected it 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.050
 has 110 millimeters of armor in the forehead by 30 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.989
 on the sides but there the fact is that 30 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.280
 millimeters at good angles and 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.280
 possible bounce 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.670
 if you do not take into account the rule of three calibers 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.830
 and a gun in 90 millimeters but such 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.459
 guns rarity at level six and in 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.890
 In principle, these are the 30 mm 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.959
 the sides of the tower they are good enough 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.600
 bounce and and save in some 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.470
 situations when you are facing your forehead 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.660
 to the enemy still on the tower there is such 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.970
 semicircular turret she's like 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.739
 would be there but no matter how 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.390
 target it in a given fight and and 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.690
 It turned out solely due to the fact that 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.410
 I was practically so close to 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.260
 to the enemy 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.900
 but at medium and long distances into it 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.780
 hit and and even aiming doesn't have 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.840
 sense but apart from armor this tank has 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.140
 also lots of good guns namely them 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.959
 three to say in a nutshell the first 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.799
 the weapon is breaking 170 alpha meters 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.280
 240 second weapon breaking through 165 alpha 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.830
 300 and the third gun 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.560
 punch and in 200 12 millimeters with alpha in 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.410
 240 difference from gun 170 millimeters 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.889
 is that it is more oblique 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.110
 and longer recharged but I am for myself 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.350
 chose the first gun because 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.060
 to pump the tank of the seventh level in 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.620
 first do not need to deflate the other two 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.350
 and for me arl 44 is all the same 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 passing tank and for on it long 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.960
 I will not linger due to the fact that 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.620
 we are still a sixth level tank breakthrough 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.440
 170 is enough for me considering that I 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.980
 so many fights skated on superpershing with 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.820
 breaking the 175 level of fighting a little bit 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.330
 worse and hardly ever used i 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.870
 gold well in rare cases there are 8 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.300
 but not the essence of the breakthrough 170 enough 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.030
 plus the reloading gain exactly 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.940
 so I kind of chose 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.120
 it is on this gun the other two 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.340
 just will not deflate but how 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.850
 says and how many people so much and 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.250
 of opinions 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.810
 so someone will like this tool 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.460
 someone following someone not at all 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.550
 steam and 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.440
 just wants everyone always punching and 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.090
 a tool of 200 12 millimeters very 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.110
 feel comfortable even on 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.590
 eighth level battles 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.990
 so what do we end up with arl 44 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.789
 positioned as a heavy tank by 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.090
 my opinion in a heavy tank should be 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.870
 two things are armor and arl 44 weapons 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.130
 both that and it allows us 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.410
 perform the role of a heavy tank on the field 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.610
 it is to go ahead and break through the defenses 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.810
 straight but reviews maneuverability it 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.550
 secondary things let them be at 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.380
 our allies who will bypass 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.430
 opponents from the flank and or highlight 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.200
 their own and given the fact that now ponerfili 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.780
 well patch back already 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.030
 kvass lowering it to the fifth level and giving 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.130
 replacement alternative to apt-85 with 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.610
 worst vertical alignment angles to 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.200
 word from a vein at arl 44 to minus 8 degrees 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:39.200
 and ohhh 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:42.700
 KV -85 -3 and punfied and his pukalka in 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.320
 300 from alpha to 390 which is now from 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.800
 almost 20 second recharge already 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.290
 no wings up at the sixth level so i 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.140
 I think this tank is a worthy alternative 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.600
 for those people who like fighting on 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.050
 the sixth levels and who love heavy 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.260
 tanks like to tank even in our game 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:06.110
 with gold for silver and it becomes 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.130
 make it harder and harder but it 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.070
 worthy candidate 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.870
 just for that, well, that's all for it 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.060
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.060
 Thanks for watching this video. 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.150
 like if you like it put 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.700
 dizlike if you don't like it and write 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.530
 comment why did you have a sniper 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.530
 90 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.530
 until
