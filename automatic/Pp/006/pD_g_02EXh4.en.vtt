00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.200
 said look what I just found 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 it's heartbreaking 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.360
 could not have discovered anything else 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.360
 no 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.520
 no 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.719
 we start this week with a good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.019
 French French reference what 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.519
 he is Belgian expects moulinsart the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.579
 dupont sayings went up that's because 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.039
 that he does not have a wand 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.659
 eric is not french and a complexion you 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.089
 know this strange feeling that he 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.460
 is going to happen something horrible of the 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.079
 kind of seeing the box but if you 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.789
 know this feeling you will play 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.829
 to a real horror platform game 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.930
 saas fell into the void and die 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.839
 in unlikely places and well 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.490
 damn my heart you were right this 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.619
 toy as a kind of punishment 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.420
 cruel you inflict laugh like it looks 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.429
 a concentrate of all that is worst 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.380
 in platform games although at 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.030
 first level look at this and I have to 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.200
 go flying locomotives 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.330
 but yet I can not go I 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.549
 I do not want to jump far enough 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.200
 at least 30 minutes to try before 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.090
 understand that this little thing we 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 sees there is actually informs you about 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.140
 which one can jump no but seriously 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.549
 commented supposed to know that if a flat 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.490
 form while it's exactly the same 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.959
 head that the rest back to the hotel I 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.610
 have to go get a letter to the 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.380
 reception while the dogs 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.140
 cooks and housekeepers and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.350
 it's probably killing me the worst 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.240
 hotel that exist in the world 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.679
 and here it is typical that's how 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.959
 I spend his cooks that make me 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.399
 touch I'll move you to the first 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.379
 plan they are too big to jump 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.269
 from above I just have to go over and 

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.269
 to be killed and more is my 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.360
 gamba campaign and its serious 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.129
 certainly it's exactly that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.080
 I want to talk about this game is a concentrate 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.370
 of frustration and action is common 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.370
 talent impossible to achieve 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.200
 the millions of thousand ports 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.700
 after avoiding killer cooks 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 I arrive at the reception for a long time to 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.970
 to say that he had already entrusted the letter 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.519
 to the captain you could not say it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.549
 before fucking a package maybe the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:44.560
 january whiskey moore kate and a 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.299
 new yeah finally saw that you ads 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.480
 with a big smile his period 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.310
 really piss off on the way to the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.810
 nepal so you know it's really there 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.129
 that we are beginning to understand that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.590
 thing we do not involve in this game 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.299
 I mean a dog of fass man I 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.709
 want to believe in it we can unfortunately but 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.629
 look at but why is earth 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.670
 a bear trap and a bell 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:15.579
 how a wallet that weighs says everything 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:17.200
 the harm you are a man of 25 so 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.940
 I found a kid who had indicated 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.620
 the way he asks me to follow him there 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.150
 do not talk so much better it's less 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:31.840
 far 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:35.250
 let's go next new go but it's 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.250
 where there he go left for talent 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.340
 when we talked a little about the spirit of 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.019
 game there is no problem the graphics 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.239
 randa 16th the world of comics 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.099
 of heredity and history tried to follow 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.959
 relatively the unfolding of the tape 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.849
 drawn but there are times where really 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.010
 it's still too much you remember 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.959
 700 movies or captain haddock 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.790
 down a slope is ironed left 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:18.060
 of a statue because the right one 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.060
 form to the left to the right is different 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.210
 katia by mouth 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.210
 no 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.479
 by the way the same thing in the game 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.330
 will offer it brings is 20 km long 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:44.689
 and 450 status to go fucking worth it 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.129
 well the woman to ride so fucking high 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:52.159
 local I control total oh there I 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.340
 understands nothing and mother I went to 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.340
 left 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.220
 cold it was really sugar to whom one 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.050
 know this game this game is a festival the 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.690
 difficulty to pass the different 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.580
 levels is really legendary it's 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.830
 just just impossible 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.840
 and again I play in easy mode and 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.970
 as if that was not enough a word not 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.430
 only every five levels but 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.460
 why all five levels 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.440
 why not all the mails you 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.199
 do not find the game already it's impossible 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.909
 like that seriously are the 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.560
 developers was just too lazy 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:42.409
 for master password at each the 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:42.409
 even fucking 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.860
 look at it but it's just 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.780
 unachievable is this kind of 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.879
 been designed for kids watching 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.069
 the adventures of tintin on france 3 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.199
 how is a 10 year old kid 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:03.449
 can successfully finish this game while 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:05.039
 I can not do it myself 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.610
 morons his scene my friends there we 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.610
 are always at the beginning 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.900
 why is there a chasm in 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.820
 a plane why is this game so cruel 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.190
 look at it if you do not fall 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.919
 exactly stack in the middle of 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.570
 platforms you go through more 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.330
 the story of the game moves forward and more 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.370
 progresses in the unattainable the looks 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.040
 and I have to use the wind to jump 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.900
 further and when I come to the end there 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.639
 no way to go further 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.340
 the ice ax walks my balls and I 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.040
 more than to commit suicide a sad good 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.449
 end after climbing the himalaya good 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.889
 I guess it must have jumped in 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.479
 face and uncheck a room and at the same 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.220
 time but damn but why is this 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.870
 that it must be hard but it is that the 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.090
 game finally it's not a simulation for 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.860
 fighter pilot take the rope from the 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.340
 share of grants for play this game 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.990

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.050
 I 'm sorry I spent so much 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.410
 time to play I'm starting to dream 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.729
 the night 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.729
 it's time to finish 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.800
 we are really doing 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 and 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.750
 1
