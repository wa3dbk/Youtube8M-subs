Les Paul's didn't go over that great in

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.700 
Les Paul's didn't go over that great in
the<00:01:53.820> beginning<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.719> you<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.469> they

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the beginning but this was you know they

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
the beginning but this was you know they
just<00:01:55.950> thought<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> joke<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.359> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
just thought it was a joke you know so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
just thought it was a joke you know so
yeah<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.109> then<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:59.100> eventually<00:01:59.310> ended<00:01:59.939> up

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
yeah and then they eventually ended up

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179 
yeah and then they eventually ended up
discontinuing<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> Les<00:02:00.990> Paul<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.950> knew<00:02:02.070> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
discontinuing the Les Paul as we knew it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.090 
discontinuing the Les Paul as we knew it
and<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.719> about<00:02:04.649> 12<00:02:04.950> years

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
and and these and then about 12 years

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.130 
and and these and then about 12 years
later<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.659> resurrected<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.749> button

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
later they resurrected a button

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.480 
later they resurrected a button
but<00:02:07.260> not<00:02:07.410> like<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.800> original<00:02:08.100> crews<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
but not like the original crews well the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.180 
but not like the original crews well the
thing<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.210> volume<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.960> music<00:02:10.470> went

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
thing is is that volume the music went

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
thing is is that volume the music went
up<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.000> um<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:12.960> guys<00:02:13.170> were<00:02:13.410> playing

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
up so um you know guys were playing

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.230 
up so um you know guys were playing
these<00:02:13.830> art<00:02:14.100> stops<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.640> stuff<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
these art stops and stuff like that and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.820 
these art stops and stuff like that and
it<00:02:15.360> was<00:02:15.450> louder<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.200> they<00:02:16.410> could<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.710> it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
it was louder you know they could get it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.530 
it was louder you know they could get it
without<00:02:16.980> dealing<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.700> feedback<00:02:17.940> too<00:02:18.330> much

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
without dealing with feedback too much

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.830 
without dealing with feedback too much
but<00:02:19.080> as<00:02:19.230> volume<00:02:19.740> became<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:21.030> bigger<00:02:21.540> thing

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
but as volume became a bigger thing

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.350 
but as volume became a bigger thing
these<00:02:22.650> guys<00:02:22.860> had<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.250> use<00:02:23.400> solid<00:02:23.640> bodies<00:02:24.120> or
