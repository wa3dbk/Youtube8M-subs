00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
that there's more to a person than just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.930 
that there's more to a person than just
one<00:01:03.050> thing<00:01:03.290> most<00:01:03.740> movies<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.220> think<00:01:04.550> they're

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
one thing most movies I think they're

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.760 
one thing most movies I think they're
surface<00:01:05.390> level<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:05.840> they<00:01:05.990> can<00:01:06.170> be<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> bit

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
surface level and they can be a bit

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.830 
surface level and they can be a bit
superficial<00:01:07.580> or<00:01:07.640> cliche<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.390> there's

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
superficial or cliche and there's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.660 
superficial or cliche and there's
nothing<00:01:09.170> about<00:01:09.230> that<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:10.070> movie<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:10.550> think

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
nothing about that in this movie I think

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.760 
nothing about that in this movie I think
that<00:01:11.000> part<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.960> James<00:01:12.170> credit<00:01:12.590> of

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
that part of that is to James credit of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.860 
that part of that is to James credit of
allowing<00:01:13.430> us<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.850> be<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.180> ones<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.660> shape

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
allowing us to be the ones to shape
