00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 at 4 is a focused now simple and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 robust designed to work with 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.650
 dry premixed materials from 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.870
 mechanical application once the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 cargo will be transported towards the camera 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 of mixing where it will be incorporated into a 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.619
 water flow regulated by means of a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 taps until reaching the consistency 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.340
 desired a worm pump 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.109
 moves this wet material through 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 from the hose to the lance 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.030
 projection from where it will be projected 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 by means of compressed air 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 supplied thanks to a compressor already 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 a parallel hose this model of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 plastered now provides a series of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.629
 advantages in its construction that makes it 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.129
 ideal for many cases on site 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.559
 offers a compact body design 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.270
 and closed what protects the most parts 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.270
 sensitive against accidental knocks 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.890
 Its low loading height decreases the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.080
 operator fatigue its 660 millimeters 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 wide guarantee a passage through places 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.060
 inaccessible while taking for 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 it a large volume hopper the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.780
 Details related to transportation 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 of the machine have been taken care of 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.310
 maximum to your external handles you have to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.260
 add other telescopic ones that allow 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 that the quattro can be hoisted to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.270
 avoiding obstacles can also be 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.160
 disassembled into four basic pieces without 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.830
 use of tools what makes it 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.020
 Most portable of all models 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.060
 in this version have been incorporated 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.210
 electromagnetic protection systems 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.090
 anti opening locking brakes on the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.010
 automatic regulator wheels 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.830
 water pressure 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.870
 the 4 has been designed following the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.870
 latest security standards
