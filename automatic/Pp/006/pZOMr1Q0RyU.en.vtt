00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 tar 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.819
 Yup 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 Good evening is Aldi 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.110
 Winter trial is also a mountain rice bowl 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:26.370
 This time b zone 4-10 Sun 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:29.630
 If I was over since I had won in the same place the day before 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.250
 Layout was changing 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.670
 The course here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.920
 The biggest difficulty is the child 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 0 wearing in options down 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.100
 Many machines are expected here 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.100
 The 70s participating in the tournament will challenge this difficult course 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:58.680
 This machine can be used for up to 2 entries. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:02.700
 Base is the first experience alkaline battery 4 qs in the tournament competition of the previous generation participation 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.220
 Align the polite in the practice practice while frustrating 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.570
 Finish in a safe state 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.570
 Main machine placement 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 It's amazing how slow it is to practice 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.780
 30 minutes after making a battery 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.780
 Or is it already gone ? 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.290
 Natural speed lost to surprising slowness 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.200
 Immediately sub-machine 6 round duster not know movie 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.890
 I'm too late 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.890
 However, it is helped by the other's course out and it somehow breaks through 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.470
 The second round no longer speed 1 also ride 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.080
 The semifinals win somehow somehow while opening while being flirt 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.450
 Semifinal start 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.450
 You can see from the palm 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.829
 No longer was a Eliminated in not at all to fight 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.110
 I understand that later on cancer 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.150
 It was that of've been bought at the reception 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.200
 Sorry this chest cavity is 1 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.200
 I will make use of it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.730
 The same obstacle in the video for the finals 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.730
 Truly master Ya 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.200
 But it was overwhelming speed throughout the tournament 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.000
 I was lost to a pink machine but it was a win 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.120
 Pink machine 8 b is hated anyway 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.460
 I asked about the motor later and it was about Hyper Dash 3 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.900
 Machine balance which puts 0 down land with dash 3 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.900
 It was really great 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.200
 me 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.200
 Juniors also open race 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.810
 From this day the practice is in good shape 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.810
 Ku' at the 1-position skip also the first round lightly 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:44.170
 This may be one of the fun of the Mini 4WD 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.170
