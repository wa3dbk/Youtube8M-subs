00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
this new set we can see a lot more

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.699 
this new set we can see a lot more
silver<00:03:32.459> metal<00:03:33.060> which<00:03:33.299> would<00:03:33.810> probably<00:03:34.079> alum

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
silver metal which would probably alum

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.039 
silver metal which would probably alum
at<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.100> aluminium<00:03:35.370> you've<00:03:36.359> basically<00:03:36.660> got<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
at the aluminium you've basically got it

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.449 
at the aluminium you've basically got it
on<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.290> ear<00:03:37.410> cups<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.010> have<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
on the ear cups you have it on the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.970 
on the ear cups you have it on the
headbands<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.380> have<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> other

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
headbands and you have it on the other

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.199 
headbands and you have it on the other
ear<00:03:41.130> Cup<00:03:41.459> as<00:03:41.609> well<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.910> have<00:03:41.970> some

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
ear Cup as well and you have some

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.970 
ear Cup as well and you have some
different<00:03:42.570> colored<00:03:42.840> buttons<00:03:43.260> underneath<00:03:43.650> as

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
different colored buttons underneath as

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.710 
different colored buttons underneath as
well<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.239> adds<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
well so I just think it adds to the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.060 
well so I just think it adds to the
design<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.079> think<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.470> makes<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.769> little<00:03:46.890> bit

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
design I think it makes a little bit

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.340 
design I think it makes a little bit
different<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:48.329> it's<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:49.019> generally

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
different and it's that it generally

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.990 
different and it's that it generally
stands<00:03:49.739> out<00:03:50.040> because<00:03:50.160> these<00:03:50.370> are<00:03:50.519> quite<00:03:50.579> shiny

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
stands out because these are quite shiny

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.970 
stands out because these are quite shiny
as<00:03:51.269> well<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.260> can<00:03:52.380> see<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.650> both<00:03:52.799> for

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
as well now as you can see on both for

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.130 
as well now as you can see on both for
the<00:03:53.040> ear<00:03:53.220> cups<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> EXO<00:03:54.600> 5s

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
the ear cups you have the EXO 5s

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.289 
the ear cups you have the EXO 5s
branding<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.950> think<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.640> have<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.880> on<00:03:56.970> this<00:03:57.120> one

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
branding I think you have it on this one

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.830 
branding I think you have it on this one
as<00:03:57.480> well<00:03:57.600> yes<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.230> do<00:03:58.910> as<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.720> as

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
as well yes you do as you can see as

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.289 
as well yes you do as you can see as
well<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.170> have<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.500> microphone<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.640> swivel

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
well you have the microphone is a swivel

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.210 
well you have the microphone is a swivel
round<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.690> only<00:04:03.840> actually<00:04:04.200> goes<00:04:04.410> one<00:04:04.950> way<00:04:05.190> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
round that only actually goes one way I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.910 
round that only actually goes one way I
think<00:04:05.569> yeah<00:04:06.569> Ashley<00:04:06.810> does<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.319> just<00:04:07.500> goes<00:04:07.680> down

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
think yeah Ashley does it just goes down

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.259 
think yeah Ashley does it just goes down
to<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.220> left<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.609> obviously<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.090> have<00:04:09.239> your

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
to the left so obviously you have your

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.170 
to the left so obviously you have your
left<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.900> right<00:04:09.959> ear<00:04:10.950> cup<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.670> is<00:04:11.700> actually

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
left and right ear cup that is actually

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.789 
left and right ear cup that is actually
obviously<00:04:12.450> has<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.019> stay<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.290> way

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
obviously has to stay that way

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.110 
obviously has to stay that way
you<00:04:14.280> have<00:04:14.459> like<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.930> material<00:04:15.930> mesh<00:04:16.139> on<00:04:16.380> top

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
you have like a material mesh on top

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.990 
you have like a material mesh on top
just<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.359> little<00:04:19.049> bit<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.289> cushioning<00:04:19.849> and<00:04:20.849> you

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
just a little bit of cushioning and you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.500 
just a little bit of cushioning and you
have<00:04:21.150> adjustable<00:04:22.049> ear<00:04:22.680> cups<00:04:22.950> on<00:04:23.130> both<00:04:23.370> sides

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
have adjustable ear cups on both sides

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.880 
have adjustable ear cups on both sides
so<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.630> can<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:24.900> pull<00:04:25.110> these<00:04:25.290> down<00:04:25.650> these

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
so you can just pull these down these

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.520 
so you can just pull these down these
are<00:04:26.100> actually<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.850> think<00:04:27.390> they<00:04:27.900> metal<00:04:28.410> or

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
are actually I think they metal or

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.670 
are actually I think they metal or
plastic<00:04:28.680> on<00:04:29.100> my<00:04:29.130> ashore<00:04:29.990> but<00:04:30.990> they<00:04:31.140> go<00:04:31.380> and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
plastic on my ashore but they go and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.170 
plastic on my ashore but they go and
they've<00:04:31.770> actually<00:04:31.920> got<00:04:32.280> grooves<00:04:32.610> as<00:04:32.880> well<00:04:33.060> as

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
they've actually got grooves as well as

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.440 
they've actually got grooves as well as
you<00:04:33.270> can<00:04:33.390> tell<00:04:33.450> make<00:04:33.990> them<00:04:34.170> even<00:04:34.500> both<00:04:34.680> sides

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
you can tell make them even both sides

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.940 
you can tell make them even both sides
you<00:04:36.450> actually<00:04:36.750> got<00:04:36.870> some<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:37.200> screws<00:04:37.680> as

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
you actually got some like screws as

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.890 
you actually got some like screws as
well<00:04:38.130> just<00:04:38.490> makes<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.540> overall

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
well just makes it so that overall

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.680 
well just makes it so that overall
finish<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.440> looks<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.710> lot<00:04:40.950> nicer<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:42.360> feels<00:04:42.570> a

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
finish it looks a lot nicer it feels a

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.230 
finish it looks a lot nicer it feels a
little<00:04:42.810> bit<00:04:42.990> heavier<00:04:43.290> as<00:04:43.380> well<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:44.760> ear<00:04:44.970> cups

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
little bit heavier as well the ear cups

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.150 
little bit heavier as well the ear cups
don't<00:04:45.450> swivel<00:04:45.930> round<00:04:46.200> but<00:04:46.650> they<00:04:46.740> do<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:47.130> a

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
don't swivel round but they do have a

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.330 
don't swivel round but they do have a
lot<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.430> move<00:04:47.730> ability<00:04:48.180> as<00:04:48.560> like<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.710> vertical

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
lot of move ability as like the vertical

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.970 
lot of move ability as like the vertical
movement<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.030> as<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.390> see<00:04:51.450> they<00:04:52.290> go<00:04:52.530> quite

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
movement so as you can see they go quite

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.580 
movement so as you can see they go quite
a<00:04:53.010> way<00:04:53.280> away<00:04:53.310> round<00:04:54.000> so<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.900> can<00:04:55.080> have<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> lot

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
a way away round so you can have a lot

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.440 
a way away round so you can have a lot
of<00:04:55.620> movement<00:04:56.130> like<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.940> potentially

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
of movement like that to potentially

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.940 
of movement like that to potentially
stand<00:04:57.810> them<00:04:58.020> up<00:04:58.140> if<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.320> want<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.680> I'm<00:04:58.800> not

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
stand them up if you want to I'm not

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.580 
stand them up if you want to I'm not
sure<00:04:59.100> if<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.310> could<00:04:59.460> but<00:04:59.960> they<00:05:00.960> probably<00:05:01.230> calm

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
sure if you could but they probably calm

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.250 
sure if you could but they probably calm
but<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.100> ear<00:05:02.700> cups<00:05:02.970> have<00:05:03.150> got<00:05:03.330> some<00:05:03.540> very<00:05:04.080> nice

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
but the ear cups have got some very nice

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.830 
but the ear cups have got some very nice
