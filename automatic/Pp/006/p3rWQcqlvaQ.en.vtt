 i 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.980
 Y 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.100
 Y 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.990
 i 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.619
 let's not be innocent gentlemen 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.200
 here we are before a rough game never in 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.130
 the country has played as rudely as 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.669
 is playing definitely there's no 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.519
 no hope for the people of 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.510
 guatemala in which justice can 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.670
 improve is not because there is no suitability not 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.760
 There is capacity of the candidate gentlemen 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.480
 to prosecutors all of them are a great 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.589
 part of them or some of them 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.379
 they understand what the process is 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.460
 legal the judicial process the state 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.370
 of right 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.059
 they know where to go but I 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.010
 I ask how far the power groups 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.350
 those mafias embedded in the state 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.890
 are willing to allow me 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.490
 then comes the choice as the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.979
 we have raised is a choice 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.270
 eminently politics in the USA as 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.760
 they said the election he becomes president and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.270
 then submit it to ratification of the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.850
 congress senate 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.399
 here in Guatemala they invented these 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.799
 conditions but actually I have 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.590
 come saying these commissions are not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.780
 they are good for nothing 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.780
 imagine you have to send him 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.969
 six candidates to the president does not 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.469
 missing the president does not need 6 the 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.810
 president what he needs is that 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.049
 include in that list one that is the one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.119
 wants to put and will achieve it has the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.429
 power to negotiate what and do what 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 you put it means that here is 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.549
 pressing on the commissions of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.189
 application is ridiculous really here 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.349
 is a power game on the head of the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.439
 president of the republic the president 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:05.399
 of the republic have to decide the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.399
 who is going to put it and in that decision is 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.679
 where it is work that is why by 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.370
 what the power groups are too 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.800
 confronted there are interests of groups 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.830
 international embassies 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.320
 of international collectives that are 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.050
 electrically supporting the function of the 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.900
 current fiscal and on the other hand to 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.280
 interests of large national groups 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.260
 they do not want her to follow 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.050
 I do not know why because in reality 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.150
 against none of them has already gone 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 but they fear maybe that in a second 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 already consolidated period can do something 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.360
 against him the truth is that this is not 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.430
 a decision as a friend said less 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.040
 we the negritos do not have anything 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.500
 what to see in this here are the big boys 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.390
 those who are deciding and are they the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.170
 that are going to shoot with the spoon 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.480
 for there, if we accept them 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.110
 beyond us if we will be 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.860
 applauding this decision or not the truth 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.709
 is that it seems to me what happens 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.670
 let's continue with the same thing because the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.290
 system is square is square to 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.769
 keep doing what you want 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.769
 it is not that new authorities give any 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.569
 hope do not give any hope even in 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.269
 the political environment where there is a 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.510
 popular election much less are going to 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.550
 give in judicial environments or in 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.180
 any environment where what there is 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.090
 it is a choice of 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.280
 gentlemen the current authorities are 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.709
 conditioned by the large groups of 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.810
 power are conditioned by crime 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.420
 organized are conditioned by the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.310
 drug trafficking are conditioned by the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.920
 political prejudices of the rulers 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.980
 it means that we are in a 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.620
 system that is drowned out a system that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.560
 he has nowhere to breathe and the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.780
 aspirations that the town could have 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.840
 they are responsible for killing themselves 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.480
 I want to tell you that this is pretty 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.519
 cynical and quite skeptical about 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.950
 to what the results of 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.549
 all these pseudo-democratic processes 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.889
 and according to the elections in this country what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.699
 that terrifies me is that it is already very 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.580
 bad we're going for worse and the matrix that's going to 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:29.030
 review the ones that will play the new 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.780
 the new presidential order or the new 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.870
 period of the people who will occupy the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.349
 charges in the judicial body is more 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.190
 of the same thing we will continue with the same 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.440
 and it scares to see 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.990
 the president is presented in a 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.020
 international program and talks about a 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.540
 wonderful country where the reduction 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.420
 impunity where there was a reform 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.760
 educational where people go happy 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.610
 in the streets asking for their reelection 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.280
 the truth that I feel confused 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.190
 for some without fear I feel 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.740
 confused because I do not know how much 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.050
 to the people guatemala can endure this 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.480
 what is happening this mockery that 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.730
 permanently it has done all this the 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.040
 commissions is a farce all the 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.080
 elections is a part of all this of the 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.670
 designation of new magistrates is a 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.740
 farce better we leave you the 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.470
 full responsibility to the president 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.720
 that's how it is in that town, it would react and 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.700
 I would say exactly what you think 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.400
 meanwhile gentlemen will follow us 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.670
 giving atole with the finger and hopefully we 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.380
 give a finger chupadita to all for 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.380
 that we can all be calm 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.320
 and
