00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.010

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.960
 white blood cells and then they attack 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.750

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.600
 enter the body and greatly improves the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.050

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.080
 in the pan 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.049
 and for this we already have to have the 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:03.060
 ravioli boiled al dente and sell us 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.850
 packaged 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.069
 so it is not necessary to do 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.770
 the ravioli but simply buy 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.260
 those that are to your liking 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.290

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 let's also put the tomato that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.480

 of tomato if they want 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.829
 I chose the tomato because I 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.019
 love the caprese salad and it gives you a 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.659
 I touch this tomato as well as here 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.579
 it looks like and like the cheese ravioli 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.930
 then you can have as well as a 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.030
 airecito that appreciates that is very 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.040
 interesting 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.060

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.730

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.670

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.620
