I've always wondered how actually who

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.129 
I've always wondered how actually who
would<00:00:14.969> kind<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.269> win<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:15.870> because

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
would kind of win on this one because

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
would kind of win on this one because
you<00:00:16.890> know<00:00:16.949> if<00:00:17.190> they<00:00:17.369> both<00:00:17.550> master<00:00:18.119> dad<00:00:18.330> let

that<00:00:18.810> Super<00:00:19.080> Saiyan<00:00:19.320> form<00:00:19.710> I'd<00:00:20.310> honestly

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that Super Saiyan form I'd honestly

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.279 
that Super Saiyan form I'd honestly
believe<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.150> brawl<00:00:21.570> he<00:00:21.720> might<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
believe that brawl he might have the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.170 
believe that brawl he might have the
advantage<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.980> because<00:00:23.340> he<00:00:23.490> he<00:00:23.939> was

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
advantage just because he he was

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.689 
advantage just because he he was
stronger<00:00:24.750> than<00:00:24.779> um<00:00:25.170> he<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.189> stronger<00:00:26.580> than

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
stronger than um he was stronger than

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
stronger than um he was stronger than
Goku<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.269> Vegeta<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.109> put<00:00:28.619> together

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
Goku and Vegeta you know put together

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
Goku and Vegeta you know put together
you<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.460> mean<00:00:29.699> not<00:00:29.789> put<00:00:29.970> together<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.449> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you know I mean not put together but I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
you know I mean not put together but I
mean<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.199> know<00:00:31.289> individual<00:00:31.890> role<00:00:32.399> II

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
mean like you know individual role II

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.760 
mean like you know individual role II
would<00:00:32.640> obviously<00:00:33.000> win<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.780> um<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.680> know

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
would obviously win because um you know

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
would obviously win because um you know
you<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.309> he<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.700> always<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> guess<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.840> lead

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you know he was always I guess will lead

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
you know he was always I guess will lead
he<00:00:37.260> always<00:00:37.380> had<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> hidden<00:00:38.100> power<00:00:38.280> I'm

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
he always had like a hidden power I'm

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
he always had like a hidden power I'm
guessing<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.540> people<00:00:39.809> said<00:00:39.960> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
guessing that a lot of people said that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
guessing that a lot of people said that
you<00:00:40.590> know<00:00:40.710> bro<00:00:40.950> Lee<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> would

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
you know bro Lee would be and would

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
you know bro Lee would be and would
always<00:00:41.760> take<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> advantage<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> mean

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
always take the advantage but I mean

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110 
always take the advantage but I mean
like<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.530> situation<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.280> believe<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.879> if

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
like in this situation I believe it if

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.779 
like in this situation I believe it if
Vegeta<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> Roli<00:00:46.680> were<00:00:46.890> both<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> same

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
Vegeta and Roli were both at the same

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
Vegeta and Roli were both at the same
power<00:00:48.149> level<00:00:48.450> pretty<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> Super

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
power level pretty much like the Super

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
power level pretty much like the Super
Saiyan<00:00:50.039> 3<00:00:50.100> form<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
Saiyan 3 form I'm pretty I have a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200 
Saiyan 3 form I'm pretty I have a
feeling<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.260> Broly<00:00:52.649> most<00:00:53.100> likely<00:00:53.730> might<00:00:53.910> win

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
feeling that Broly most likely might win

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.580 
feeling that Broly most likely might win
but<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.539> never<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.840> Vegeta<00:00:55.199> might<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
but you never know Vegeta might have a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
but you never know Vegeta might have a
chance<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> know<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.760> both<00:00:56.850> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
try to beat all three of the games but

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.789 
try to beat all three of the games but
then<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> same<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.530> all

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
then at the same time it's just like all

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.440 
then at the same time it's just like all
three<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> games<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> story
