the<00:04:26.780> AC<00:04:27.500> adapter<00:04:27.740> straight<00:04:28.250> into<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.490> 3ds

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
the AC adapter straight into the 3ds

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.260 
the AC adapter straight into the 3ds
just<00:04:29.449> place<00:04:29.660> them<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.350> cradle<00:04:30.620> just<00:04:31.270> it's

just place them in the cradle just it's
not<00:04:32.449> don't<00:04:33.050> really<00:04:33.229> need<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.590> but<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:34.310> like<00:04:34.490> a

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
not don't really need it but it's like a

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.340 
not don't really need it but it's like a
place<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.880> store<00:04:35.090> your<00:04:35.210> 3d<00:04:35.510> s<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.960> pop<00:04:36.199> it<00:04:36.229> on

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
place to store your 3d s is pop it on

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.800 
place to store your 3d s is pop it on
there<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.710> then<00:04:36.820> plug<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.850> AC<00:04:38.000> tap<00:04:38.449> into<00:04:38.660> this

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
there and then plug the AC tap into this

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.150 
there and then plug the AC tap into this
you<00:04:39.289> can<00:04:39.410> still<00:04:39.560> plug<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.830> AC<00:04:39.860> adapter

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
you can still plug the AC adapter

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.310 
you can still plug the AC adapter
straight<00:04:40.669> into<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.030> three<00:04:41.750> days<00:04:41.900> if<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.110> want

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
straight into the three days if you want

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.129 
straight into the three days if you want
but<00:04:42.530> this<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:44.330> more<00:04:44.539> convenient<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:44.990> guess

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
but this is this more convenient I guess

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.189 
but this is this more convenient I guess
and<00:04:46.300> nothing<00:04:47.300> too<00:04:47.419> exciting<00:04:47.690> about<00:04:47.900> the

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
and nothing too exciting about the

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.909 
and nothing too exciting about the
cradle<00:04:48.949> itself<00:04:49.039> just<00:04:50.199> plug<00:04:51.199> in<00:04:51.320> there<00:04:51.530> or<00:04:51.680> good

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
cradle itself just plug in there or good

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.770 
cradle itself just plug in there or good
and<00:04:54.310> nothing<00:04:55.310> deciding<00:04:55.880> about<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.330> just<00:04:56.690> a

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
and nothing deciding about it just a

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.510 
and nothing deciding about it just a
standard<00:04:57.440> cable<00:04:57.740> like<00:04:57.889> i<00:04:57.979> said<00:04:58.130> before<00:04:58.190> i<00:04:58.370> can

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.029 
standard cable like i said before i can
choose<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.760> decile<00:04:59.240> dsi<00:04:59.660> XL<00:04:59.889> cable<00:05:00.889> if<00:05:00.979> you

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
choose the decile dsi XL cable if you

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.170 
choose the decile dsi XL cable if you
want<00:05:01.870> okay<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.430> that's<00:05:04.430> pretty<00:05:04.700> much<00:05:04.820> entire

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
want okay and that's pretty much entire

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.529 
want okay and that's pretty much entire
boxing<00:05:05.630> nothing<00:05:05.930> else<00:05:06.139> in<00:05:06.590> there<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.389> guess

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
boxing nothing else in there so I guess

of<00:05:49.850> our<00:05:51.250> example<00:05:52.250> on<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:52.820> best<00:05:52.970> viewing<00:05:53.240> angle

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
of our example on the best viewing angle

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.620 
of our example on the best viewing angle
the<00:05:53.720> sweet<00:05:54.020> spot<00:05:54.289> going<00:05:55.280> next<00:05:55.639> um<00:05:58.630> it's

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
guess we're going to the setup process

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.170 
guess we're going to the setup process
now<00:06:18.039> but<00:06:18.249> that<00:06:18.430> will<00:06:18.550> be<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.669> different<00:06:18.939> video
