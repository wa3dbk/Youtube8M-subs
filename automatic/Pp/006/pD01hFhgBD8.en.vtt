so<00:00:08.760> welcome<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.210> today's<00:00:09.480> lesson<00:00:09.719> where<00:00:10.170> we're

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
so welcome to today's lesson where we're

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.869 
so welcome to today's lesson where we're
going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.680> discussing<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.549> simple

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
going to be discussing a simple

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.350 
going to be discussing a simple
calculation<00:00:12.620> for<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.010> free<00:00:14.400> water<00:00:14.789> clearance

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
calculation for the free water clearance

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.870 
calculation for the free water clearance
which<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> basically<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.189> tell<00:00:17.400> us<00:00:17.609> how

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
which is basically going to tell us how

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.200 
which is basically going to tell us how
much<00:00:18.090> water<00:00:19.189> comprises<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> person's<00:00:20.880> urine

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
much water comprises a person's urine

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
much water comprises a person's urine
output<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.769> an<00:00:22.890> important

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
output and this is an important

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.249 
output and this is an important
calculation<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.509> those<00:00:24.689> patients<00:00:25.140> who<00:00:25.230> have

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
calculation in those patients who have

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.159 
calculation in those patients who have
problems<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:26.009> water<00:00:26.339> balance<00:00:27.079> patients<00:00:28.079> who

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
problems with water balance patients who

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.179 
problems with water balance patients who
have<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.740> example<00:00:28.829> SIADH<00:00:29.579> or<00:00:31.189> primary

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
have for example SIADH or primary

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.490 
have for example SIADH or primary
polydipsia<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:33.989> much<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
polydipsia we need to know how much of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
polydipsia we need to know how much of
their<00:00:34.800> urine<00:00:35.220> is<00:00:35.370> water<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:36.060> any<00:00:36.600> amount

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
their urine is water because any amount

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.610 
their urine is water because any amount
above<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.270> drunk<00:00:39.270> by<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.510> patient<00:00:40.140> will

above that if drunk by the patient will

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.260 
above that if drunk by the patient will
cause<00:00:40.890> some<00:00:41.430> type<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.700> symptomatic

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
free water clearance and a calculated
we're<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.580> to<00:00:47.670> come<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.060> a<00:00:48.120> simple

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
we're going to come up with a simple

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.510 
we're going to come up with a simple
model<00:00:48.810> that<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.830> call<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.430> lead<00:00:50.610> pipe<00:00:50.910> model

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
model that I call the lead pipe model

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.600 
model that I call the lead pipe model
now<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.790> model<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.810> termed<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.370> number

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
now this model can be termed in a number

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.210 
now this model can be termed in a number
of<00:00:56.640> ways<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:57.450> it<00:00:58.140> may<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.830> lead<00:00:58.980> pipe

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
of ways and it may not be the lead pipe

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.030 
of ways and it may not be the lead pipe
model<00:00:59.580> in<00:00:59.730> any<00:00:59.910> book<00:01:00.330> that<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.660> read<00:01:00.810> but<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
model in any book that you read but it

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.860 
model in any book that you read but it
seems<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> work<00:01:02.580> for<00:01:03.000> me<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.150> I'm<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.720> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
seems to work for me so I'm going to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.999 
seems to work for me so I'm going to
describe<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> circle<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
describe it to you the circle here is

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.280 
describe it to you the circle here is
your<00:01:08.189> glomerulus<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.570> pipe<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.140> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
your glomerulus and the pipe here is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
your glomerulus and the pipe here is
your<00:01:10.470> lead<00:01:10.650> pipe<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.790> called<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.270> lead

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
your lead pipe and it's called a lead

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.290 
your lead pipe and it's called a lead
pipe<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.740> couple<00:01:14.730> of<00:01:14.820> assumptions

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
pipe because a couple of assumptions

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.250 
pipe because a couple of assumptions
have<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.690> be<00:01:15.840> made<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.890> first<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:18.260> no

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
have to be made the first is that no

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:29.870 
have to be made the first is that no
sodium<00:01:20.870> is<00:01:21.870> absorbed<00:01:24.590> from<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.740> pipe<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:28.880> no

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
sodium is absorbed from this pipe and no

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
sodium is absorbed from this pipe and no
sodium<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:32.550> secreted<00:01:33.260> into<00:01:34.260> this<00:01:34.380> pipe<00:01:37.070> so

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
sodium is secreted into this pipe so

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
sodium is secreted into this pipe so
you've<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> pipe<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> doesn't

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you've got a pipe here that doesn't

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.649 
you've got a pipe here that doesn't
allow<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.320> sodium<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.040> enter<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.700> exit<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
allow for sodium to enter or exit in

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.570 
allow for sodium to enter or exit in
other<00:01:42.900> words<00:01:43.200> whatever<00:01:43.530> sodium<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.250> start

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
other words whatever sodium you start

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.020 
other words whatever sodium you start
out<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.900> here<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.250> sodium<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> you're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
out with here is a sodium that you're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.410 
out with here is a sodium that you're
going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> end<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:49.340> here<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
going to end up with here and this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.620 
going to end up with here and this
concept<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.979> foundation<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.390> free

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
concept is the foundation for the free

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.859 
concept is the foundation for the free
water<00:01:54.780> clearance<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.530> least<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.220> simple

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
water clearance at least this simple

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.060 
water clearance at least this simple
free<00:01:57.869> water<00:01:58.080> clearance<00:01:58.470> equation<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.950> we're

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
free water clearance equation that we're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
free water clearance equation that we're
going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.220> go<00:01:59.430> through<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.690> know<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
going to go through so we know that this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109 
going to go through so we know that this
is<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.530> true<00:02:01.830> we<00:02:02.010> know<00:02:02.159> sodium<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.670> absorbed

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
is not true we know sodium is absorbed

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.600 
is not true we know sodium is absorbed
and<00:02:03.240> sometimes<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.930> secreted<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.530> very<00:02:04.770> few

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and sometimes it's secreted in very few

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
and sometimes it's secreted in very few
cases<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.600> we're<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.530> make<00:02:07.650> these<00:02:07.860> two

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
cases but we're going to make these two

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.529 
cases but we're going to make these two
assumptions<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.000> order<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.299> calculate

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
assumptions here in order to calculate

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.250 
assumptions here in order to calculate
the<00:02:10.319> free<00:02:10.530> water<00:02:10.679> clearance<00:02:11.159> so<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:13.080> know

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the free water clearance so if we know

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
the free water clearance so if we know
that<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.650> sodium<00:02:14.010> at<00:02:14.189> this<00:02:14.400> point<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:15.209> equal

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
that the sodium at this point is equal

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.390 
that the sodium at this point is equal
to<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.690> sodium<00:02:15.990> at<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.230> point<00:02:16.560> let's<00:02:17.099> try<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
to the sodium at this point let's try to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.970 
to the sodium at this point let's try to
mathematically<00:02:18.240> define<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.380> sodium<00:02:19.800> at

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
mathematically define the sodium at

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.230 
mathematically define the sodium at
these<00:02:20.220> two<00:02:20.370> points

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
these two points

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240 
these two points
so<00:02:21.360> we'll<00:02:21.480> call<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.750> point<00:02:21.960> one<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:23.100> we'll

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so we'll call this point one and we'll

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 
so we'll call this point one and we'll
call<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.490> point<00:02:23.820> two<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.960> let's<00:02:25.170> go<00:02:25.290> up<00:02:25.410> here

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
call this point two so let's go up here

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.090 
call this point two so let's go up here
and<00:02:25.680> let's<00:02:26.010> talk<00:02:26.280> about<00:02:26.460> Oh<00:02:26.610> point<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and let's talk about Oh point one so the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.550 
and let's talk about Oh point one so the
sodium<00:02:29.490> at<00:02:29.580> point<00:02:29.820> one<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.240> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
sodium at point one is going to be the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.170 
sodium at point one is going to be the
concentration<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.400> sodium<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.660> serum

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
concentration of sodium in the serum

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.140 
concentration of sodium in the serum
times<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.450> amount<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.900> fluid<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.150> crosses

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
times the amount of fluid that crosses

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.190 
times the amount of fluid that crosses
the<00:02:39.390> membrane<00:02:40.640> we'll<00:02:41.640> call<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.200> what

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the membrane we'll call that a what

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.980 
the membrane we'll call that a what
about<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.770> sodium<00:02:44.130> at<00:02:44.310> point<00:02:44.610> two<00:02:44.990> well

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
about the sodium at point two well

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.540 
about the sodium at point two well
that's<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.650> concentration<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.490> sodium<00:02:48.050> in

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
that's the concentration of sodium in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.330 
that's the concentration of sodium in
the<00:02:50.550> urine<00:02:50.960> times<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.770> amount<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> urine<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the urine times the amount of urine the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.000 
the urine times the amount of urine the
patient<00:02:53.670> makes<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:56.430> urine<00:02:56.580> output<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.170> we

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
patient makes the urine output so we

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.320 
patient makes the urine output so we
know<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.160> these<00:02:59.430> two<00:02:59.490> equations<00:02:59.850> are<00:03:00.210> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
know that these two equations are the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.630 
know that these two equations are the
same<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:01.230> equal<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.950> each<00:03:02.070> other<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.370> know<00:03:02.490> that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
same or equal to each other we know that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.230 
same or equal to each other we know that
x1<00:03:03.020> is<00:03:04.020> going<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.500> equal<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.890> x2

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
x1 is going to have to equal to x2

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.910 
x1 is going to have to equal to x2
because<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.050> assumptions<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.650> made

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
because of the assumptions that we made

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.080 
because of the assumptions that we made
down<00:03:08.130> here<00:03:08.960> so<00:03:10.520> let's<00:03:11.520> put<00:03:11.760> these<00:03:11.910> two

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
down here so let's put these two

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.010 
down here so let's put these two
together<00:03:12.210> let's<00:03:12.720> get<00:03:12.900> some<00:03:13.110> more<00:03:13.290> screen<00:03:13.880> and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
together let's get some more screen and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.240 
together let's get some more screen and
let's<00:03:16.020> put<00:03:16.170> these<00:03:16.290> two<00:03:16.350> together<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.130> know

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
let's put these two together so we know

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.870 
let's put these two together so we know
X<00:03:17.430> 1<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.750> equal<00:03:18.870> x<00:03:19.110> 2<00:03:19.410> we<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.460> X<00:03:20.640> 1

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
X 1 it's going to equal x 2 we know X 1

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:32.900 
X 1 it's going to equal x 2 we know X 1
is<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:25.010> we<00:03:26.010> know<00:03:26.130> X<00:03:26.280> 2<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.790> this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.660 

all<00:03:33.510> right<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.500> which<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:34.950> these<00:03:35.160> quantities

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
all right so which of these quantities

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.910 
all right so which of these quantities
do<00:03:35.910> we<00:03:36.030> know<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.450> which<00:03:36.660> don't<00:03:37.050> we<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.320> we

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
do we know and which don't we know we

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.410 
do we know and which don't we know we
know<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.220> serum<00:03:38.520> concentration<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.240> sodium

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
know the serum concentration of sodium

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.360 
know the serum concentration of sodium
we<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:39.900> measure<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.320> we<00:03:41.100> know<00:03:41.250> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
we can measure that we know the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.370 
we can measure that we know the
concentration<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:42.390> sodium<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> urine

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
concentration of sodium in the urine

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.380 
concentration of sodium in the urine
because<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.130> measure<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:45.270> know

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
because we can measure that and we know

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.880 
because we can measure that and we know
the<00:03:45.510> urine<00:03:45.750> output<00:03:46.050> because<00:03:46.290> we<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.620> ask<00:03:46.740> the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the urine output because we just ask the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.320 
the urine output because we just ask the
patient<00:03:47.190> how<00:03:47.280> much<00:03:47.430> urine<00:03:47.730> do<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:47.910> make<00:03:48.090> over

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
patient how much urine do you make over

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.930 
patient how much urine do you make over
a<00:03:48.780> specified<00:03:49.140> period<00:03:49.710> of<00:03:49.740> time<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.700> what<00:03:50.850> we

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
a specified period of time so what we

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.090 
a specified period of time so what we
don't<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.240> is<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.470> turns<00:03:52.680> out<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:52.920> a

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
don't know is a now it turns out that a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.450 
don't know is a now it turns out that a
is<00:03:53.730> not<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.960> free<00:03:55.110> water<00:03:55.260> clearance<00:03:55.710> this<00:03:56.190> is

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
is not the free water clearance this is

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.990 
is not the free water clearance this is
not<00:03:57.030> equal<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.500> free<00:03:58.800> water<00:03:59.610> clearance<00:04:00.360> a

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
not equal to the free water clearance a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.710 
not equal to the free water clearance a
represents<00:04:03.000> volume<00:04:05.180> because<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:08.600> let<00:04:09.600> me

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
represents volume because a let me

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.840 
represents volume because a let me
graphically<00:04:10.200> represent<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.800> for<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.160> is

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
graphically represent that for you is

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.170 
graphically represent that for you is
this

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.840 

there's<00:04:18.180> our<00:04:18.330> lead<00:04:18.540> pipe<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:20.100> represents

there's our lead pipe and a represents

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.930 
there's our lead pipe and a represents
the<00:04:20.970> fluid<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.450> crosses<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:23.280> membrane<00:04:23.460> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
the fluid that crosses the membrane the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.240 
the fluid that crosses the membrane the
glomerular<00:04:24.450> membrane<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.530> carries<00:04:26.070> with

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
glomerular membrane and it carries with

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.580 
glomerular membrane and it carries with
it<00:04:26.280> sodium<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.150> any<00:04:27.570> fluid<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.230> carries

it sodium and any fluid that carries

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.670 
it sodium and any fluid that carries
sodium<00:04:29.040> with<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.670> by<00:04:30.360> definition

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
sodium with it is by definition

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.980 
sodium with it is by definition
considered<00:04:31.680> volume<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:33.420> know<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
considered volume so we know that the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.490 
considered volume so we know that the
urine<00:04:34.350> output<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.950> composed<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.580> two<00:04:35.820> things

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
urine output is composed of two things

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.230 
urine output is composed of two things
here<00:04:37.500> an<00:04:37.590> output<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.980> composed<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.520> volume<00:04:39.030> and

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
here an output is composed of volume and

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.200 
here an output is composed of volume and
is<00:04:39.870> composed<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.440> free<00:04:40.770> water<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.910> want<00:04:42.120> to

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
is composed of free water we want to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.140 
is composed of free water we want to
know<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.600> proportion<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:43.290> each<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.940> let's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
know the proportion of each so let's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.540 
know the proportion of each so let's
solve<00:04:45.480> for<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.140> that's<00:04:46.320> simple<00:04:46.830> we'll<00:04:47.400> just

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
solve for a and that's simple we'll just

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.770 
solve for a and that's simple we'll just
make<00:04:47.700> this<00:04:48.419> equation<00:04:49.350> rearranged<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:54.600> we<00:04:54.690> know

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
make this equation rearranged so we know

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.880 
make this equation rearranged so we know
a<00:04:55.020> is<00:04:55.260> going<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.530> equal<00:05:00.530> times<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.680> you're<00:05:01.800> an

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
a is going to equal times that you're an

sodium<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.230> serum<00:05:07.500> now<00:05:08.370> we'll<00:05:08.580> get<00:05:08.820> a

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
sodium in this serum now we'll get a

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.540

because<00:05:09.450> we<00:05:09.600> know<00:05:09.750> these<00:05:09.960> three<00:05:10.290> entities

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
because we know these three entities

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.159 
because we know these three entities
when<00:05:11.550> we<00:05:11.700> get<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:12.060> what<00:05:12.330> do<00:05:12.390> we<00:05:12.510> do<00:05:12.690> with<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.990> well

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
when we get a what do we do with it well

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.100 
when we get a what do we do with it well
a<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.590> not<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.800> free<00:05:14.130> water<00:05:14.310> clearance<00:05:14.850> a

represents<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.620> amount<00:05:16.980> of<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.250> urine

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
represents the amount of the urine

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.080 
represents the amount of the urine
output<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.480> volume<00:05:19.370> well<00:05:20.370> if<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.850> know

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
output that is volume well if you know

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.690 
output that is volume well if you know
what<00:05:21.870> percent<00:05:22.380> of<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.830> urine<00:05:23.130> output<00:05:23.520> is

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
what percent of the urine output is

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.170 
what percent of the urine output is
volume<00:05:24.480> or<00:05:24.660> what<00:05:25.050> amount<00:05:25.500> is<00:05:25.770> volume<00:05:26.220> then<00:05:27.030> you

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
volume or what amount is volume then you

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.570 
volume or what amount is volume then you
know<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.690> urine<00:05:27.930> output<00:05:28.320> minus<00:05:29.190> that

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
know that the urine output minus that

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.300 
know that the urine output minus that
quantity<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.780> going<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.080> equal<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:32.040> free

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
quantity is going to equal the free

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.620 
quantity is going to equal the free
water<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:33.290> that's<00:05:34.290> what<00:05:34.530> we<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:34.890> here<00:05:35.630> and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
water and that's what we have here and

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.870 
water and that's what we have here and
that's<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.320> simple<00:05:37.740> way<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:37.980> calculating<00:05:38.490> the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
that's a simple way of calculating the

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.909 
that's a simple way of calculating the
free<00:05:39.090> water<00:05:39.270> clearance<00:05:39.870> if<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.530> know<00:05:40.740> that

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
free water clearance if you know that

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.860 
free water clearance if you know that
you're<00:05:41.070> an<00:05:41.160> output<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:42.210> know<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.630> volume

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
you're an output and you know the volume

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.779 
you're an output and you know the volume
then<00:05:43.470> you<00:05:43.560> know<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.890> difference<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.460> the

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
then you know that the difference is the

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.620 
then you know that the difference is the
free<00:05:45.000> water

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
free water

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.610 
free water
so<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.970> can<00:05:49.210> do<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.360> simple<00:05:49.690> proportion<00:05:50.410> and

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
so you can do a simple proportion and

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.190 
so you can do a simple proportion and
say<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:52.630> following<00:05:54.120> that<00:05:55.120> whatever<00:05:55.720> you<00:05:55.960> get

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
say the following that whatever you get

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.320 
say the following that whatever you get
for<00:05:56.590> a<00:05:56.800> well<00:05:57.460> let's<00:05:57.700> change<00:05:57.940> that<00:05:58.120> again

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
for a well let's change that again

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.570 
for a well let's change that again
whatever<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.600> get<00:06:01.900> for<00:06:02.290> a<00:06:04.980> divided<00:06:05.980> by<00:06:06.130> the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
whatever you get for a divided by the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.620 
whatever you get for a divided by the
urine<00:06:06.880> output<00:06:07.740> and<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:08.770> quantity<00:06:09.520> is<00:06:10.480> going

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
urine output and that quantity is going

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.710 
urine output and that quantity is going
to<00:06:10.750> be<00:06:10.840> deducted<00:06:11.440> by<00:06:11.560> one<00:06:12.360> that's<00:06:13.360> going<00:06:13.660> to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
to be deducted by one that's going to

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.760 
to be deducted by one that's going to
equal<00:06:16.020> your<00:06:17.020> free<00:06:17.260> water<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:19.260> so<00:06:20.260> you<00:06:20.350> can<00:06:20.560> use

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
equal your free water and so you can use

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.270 
equal your free water and so you can use
this<00:06:20.980> percent<00:06:21.580> one<00:06:22.480> minus<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:23.200> divided<00:06:24.160> by

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
this percent one minus a divided by

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.880 
this percent one minus a divided by
urine<00:06:24.610> output<00:06:24.940> on<00:06:25.240> a<00:06:25.380> daily<00:06:26.380> basis<00:06:26.740> to

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
complicated because they add a lot more
