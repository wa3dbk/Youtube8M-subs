there again explore so for now runs the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.560 
there again explore so for now runs the
show<00:01:53.290> uh<00:01:53.759> sharp<00:01:54.759> knife<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.939> them<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:58.270> side

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
show uh sharp knife do them on this side

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.069 
show uh sharp knife do them on this side
is<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.409> second<00:01:59.890> thin<00:02:00.360> lift<00:02:01.360> up<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.689> hold<00:02:04.930> it

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
is this second thin lift up you hold it

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.430 
is this second thin lift up you hold it
then<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.310> go<00:02:06.520> for<00:02:08.250> across<00:02:09.250> there<00:02:09.490> again<00:02:09.729> and

then you go for across there again and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.830 
then you go for across there again and
you<00:02:11.440> straight<00:02:12.130> down<00:02:13.890> create<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> backbone

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you straight down create the backbone

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.910 
you straight down create the backbone
straight<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:22.019> as<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.470> here

straight on and as you can see here
there<00:02:23.220> little<00:02:23.700> scales<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:26.310> keep<00:02:26.519> going

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
there little scales just keep going

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.350 
there little scales just keep going
along<00:02:28.580> backbone<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.849> guys<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.910> their

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
along backbone of the guys and their
