okay<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.040> today<00:00:08.670> we're<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.180> be

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
okay so today we're going to be

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.470 
okay so today we're going to be
attempting<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.990> learn<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.559> palm<00:00:11.480> circle

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
attempting to learn a palm circle

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.310 
attempting to learn a palm circle
isolation<00:00:13.490> now<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:15.090> big<00:00:15.299> part<00:00:15.600> for<00:00:15.930> me<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
isolation now the big part for me and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.210 
isolation now the big part for me and
learning<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.740> trick<00:00:17.000> was<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.440> focus<00:00:19.770> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
learning this trick was to not focus on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.910 
learning this trick was to not focus on
trying<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.670> isolate<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.210> ball<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.690> first<00:00:22.020> what

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
trying to isolate the ball at first what

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.010 
trying to isolate the ball at first what
I<00:00:22.950> focused<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.610> was<00:00:23.790> rolling<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> ball<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
I focused on was rolling the ball on a

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.260 
I focused on was rolling the ball on a
circle<00:00:25.500> around<00:00:25.620> my<00:00:25.950> hand<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.850> getting<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
circle around my hand and getting it to

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.830 
circle around my hand and getting it to
be<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> nice<00:00:27.720> consistent<00:00:28.440> circle<00:00:29.420> in<00:00:30.420> order<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
be a nice consistent circle in order to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.860 
be a nice consistent circle in order to
do<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.470> had<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> focus<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.480> what<00:00:33.480> each<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
do this I had to focus on what each of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
do this I had to focus on what each of
my<00:00:33.989> fingers<00:00:34.350> did<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.250> ball<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.460> rotating

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
my fingers did as the ball was rotating

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.889 
my fingers did as the ball was rotating
it<00:00:36.300> around<00:00:36.629> and<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.069> you<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.210> try<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it around and so you want to try and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
it around and so you want to try and
pinpoint<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.859> exactly<00:00:41.339> your<00:00:41.460> thumb<00:00:41.730> does

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
pinpoint what exactly your thumb does

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
pinpoint what exactly your thumb does
exactly<00:00:42.569> each<00:00:43.350> finger<00:00:43.949> is<00:00:44.159> doing

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
exactly each finger is doing

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
exactly each finger is doing
individually<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:46.140> create<00:00:46.499> the<00:00:46.649> whole<00:00:46.829> motion

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
individually to create the whole motion

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.469 
individually to create the whole motion
of<00:00:47.429> the<00:00:47.550> ball<00:00:47.760> rolling<00:00:48.479> in<00:00:48.569> a<00:00:48.659> circle<00:00:49.579> now<00:00:50.579> what

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
of the ball rolling in a circle now what

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.469 
of the ball rolling in a circle now what
the<00:00:51.659> next<00:00:51.839> step<00:00:52.139> is<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.949> move<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.850> hand<00:00:54.149> in

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
the next step is is to move your hand in

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.840 
the next step is is to move your hand in
the<00:00:55.289> opposite<00:00:55.859> direction<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.639> ball<00:00:56.819> is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the opposite direction that the ball is

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.410 
the opposite direction that the ball is
rolling<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> mean<00:00:59.159> by<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> your

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
rolling and what I mean by that is your

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.849 
rolling and what I mean by that is your
hands<00:01:00.629> doing<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.019> same<00:01:01.199> circle<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.799> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hands doing the same circle that the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
hands doing the same circle that the
ball<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.129> doing<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.819> it's<00:01:02.909> doing<00:01:03.179> it<00:01:03.299> at<00:01:03.389> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
ball is doing but it's doing it at the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
ball is doing but it's doing it at the
opposite<00:01:04.110> time<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.380> ball<00:01:07.590> moves

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
opposite time so when the ball moves

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.420 
opposite time so when the ball moves
left<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:09.329> hand<00:01:09.539> moves<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> ball

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
left my hand moves right when the ball

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.760 
left my hand moves right when the ball
moves<00:01:11.700> towards<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.509> my<00:01:12.719> hand<00:01:12.990> moves<00:01:13.140> away<00:01:13.380> from

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
moves towards me my hand moves away from

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
moves towards me my hand moves away from
me<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.149> this<00:01:15.149> is<00:01:15.210> what's<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.960> create

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
me and this is what's going to create

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
me and this is what's going to create
the<00:01:16.560> illusion<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.039> the<00:01:17.189> ball<00:01:17.340> sitting<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> one

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the illusion of the ball sitting in one

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.889 
the illusion of the ball sitting in one
place<00:01:22.640> some<00:01:23.640> people<00:01:23.969> find<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.329> helpful<00:01:24.630> with

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
place some people find it helpful with

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.630 
place some people find it helpful with
this<00:01:25.079> trick<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> try<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.829> with<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.189> balls<00:01:26.430> in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this trick to try it with two balls in

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.719 
this trick to try it with two balls in
their<00:01:26.759> hands<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.859> try<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:28.920> move<00:01:29.100> both<00:01:29.399> balls

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
their hands and try and move both balls

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
their hands and try and move both balls
around<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.390> circle<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:30.930> hand<00:01:31.079> without

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
around in a circle in your hand without

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.039 
around in a circle in your hand without
touching<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.700> look<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.270> idea<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
touching this look if you an idea of the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
touching this look if you an idea of the
circle<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:35.039> ball<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
circle you want the ball to do when it's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
circle you want the ball to do when it's
by<00:01:36.420> itself<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.250> same

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
by itself and you can do the same

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
by itself and you can do the same
isolation<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.509> two<00:01:39.810> balls<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:46.460> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
isolation with two balls you just and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580 
isolation with two balls you just and
then<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.359> try<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.689> take<00:01:49.140> away<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
then you just try and take away that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.910 
then you just try and take away that
second<00:01:50.070> ball

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.140 

so<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.400> find<00:01:56.580> interesting<00:01:56.909> about

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
so one thing I find interesting about

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.330 
so one thing I find interesting about
contact<00:01:57.689> juggling<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:58.650> can<00:01:58.890> every

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
contact juggling is that you can every

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.460 
contact juggling is that you can every
trick<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
trick that you can do you can do it

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.180 
trick that you can do you can do it
forward<00:02:02.689> backward<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.180> left<00:02:06.299> hand

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
forward backward and with your left hand

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.999 
forward backward and with your left hand
so<00:02:08.869> when<00:02:09.869> practicing<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> should<00:02:10.800> practice

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so when practicing you should practice

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.470 
so when practicing you should practice
every<00:02:11.790> direction<00:02:11.970> possible<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.440> both<00:02:13.709> hands

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
every direction possible with both hands

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.120 
every direction possible with both hands
because<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.750> will<00:02:15.900> make<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.350> better<00:02:16.830> at

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
because this will make you better at

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.970 
because this will make you better at
knowing<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.690> you're<00:02:18.870> doing<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.440> general

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
knowing what you're doing in general

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.680 
knowing what you're doing in general
instead<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.519> just<00:02:20.730> knowing<00:02:20.880> how<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.360> one

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
instead of just knowing how to do one

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.460 
instead of just knowing how to do one
specific<00:02:22.319> aspect<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> trick<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.470> that
