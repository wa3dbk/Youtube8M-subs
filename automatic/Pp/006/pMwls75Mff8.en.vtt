00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.200
 ah 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 the factor to which we belong can 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.220
 be the 2 or the 3 that are the most common 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.710
 here the factors one are the Nordic 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.150
 for example the foreigners that you see that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.250
 they are always walking crabs or prawns 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.700
 ok we have here from me from her 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.670
 example what is 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.560
 a skin phototype in number 3 because 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.350
 she tans 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.290
 but you can burn to prepare the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.400
 skin that we have to do then 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.860
 days before 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.770
 the ideal is to make us a good 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.460
 exfoliation 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.380
 the exfoliation we can make it simple 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.930
 we do not have to be there rubbing either 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.510
 us but at least remove the layers 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.130
 superficial ones that are deposited in 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.520
 the skin that are already dead and that are going to 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.309
 to fall and then hydrate the skin well 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.070
 We can use a typical glove 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.229
 horsehair that is let's see what scrapes 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.570
 that is strong cited because if not 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.850
 we do nothing we can use too 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.340
 these gadgets that now go is very 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.950
 fashionable that are to exfoliate I know 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.020
 they have a little motor and then 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 they are also very practical and do not 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.009
 no harm 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.180
 these serve for the body are changed and 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.180
 they also serve for the face 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.490
 we use these premises that are sold 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.490
 in aesthetic centers or in perfumeries 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.630
 and these are the traditional peels 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.720
 when you do a peeling in the shower 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.880
 remember that you should not put soap 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.450
 because the peeling and you 're going foliar and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 is going to do 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.570
 Cleaning the skin deeply and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.820
 then it clears up is perfectly 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.190
 good hydration and you are 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.679
 ready to remember that a peeling 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.420
 at least 48 hours not the same day 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.670
 that you go to the beach because if not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.490
 is you will have the skin so free and so 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.040
 soft and so receptive to the sun that 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.630
 then yes you will stay we have to 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.840
 know also where we are going to burn 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.940
 sure we're going to burn and where 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.000
 more we have to protect ourselves then 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.840
 are the areas whenever you get more more 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.400
 that is 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.400
 it will be the neckline 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.760
 will be the shoulders 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.520
 the knees 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.610
 the lumbar areas 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.490
 also for example to the front the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.520
 classic blushes that we all come 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.580
 super reddish on the beach all those 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.470
 are areas we have to keep in mind that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.200
 are the ones that we have to protect the most 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.330
 the most constant we have to do to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.260
 the time to put on the protectors 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.510
 solar to the beach you can go 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.540
 at any time but well protected 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.569
 more hours 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.840
 negative or that will do us more harm 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.269
 are going to be the hours between 12 and 4 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.760
 in the afternoon that is when we are always 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.610
 on the beach 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.129
 and then when we are in those hours 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.090
 we will always have to be looking 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.299
 umbrellas or if not protect us very much 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.370
 It is important that you bring an umbrella 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.079
 always a tiny umbrella for the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.940
 specific hours of the sun that is when 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.940
 you are going to be the glasses 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.569
 a good one good 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.640
 pamela because because this kind of 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.860
 hat because this hat has wing 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.770
 and we will fully protect all 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.830
 which is the face and of course a 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.140
 divine and spectacular pareo the pareo 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.730
 It serves primarily to cover us in 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.750
 those areas that we will be more 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.570
 unprotected in those hours of 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.900
 chiringuito we have to remember that if 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.470
 we belong to a skin phototype 2 is 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.040
 say that we are very white we are going to 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.350
 Always burn bronze masters very badly 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.640
 we have to prepare the skin too 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:36.200
 adding some solar activator for 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.510
 example or in cremitas also 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.420
 they sell pills at the pharmacy I do not 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.060
 I recommend much more 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.560
 the most reasonable thing is foods that carry 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.100
 many vitamins and vitamin c 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.830
 tomato juice carrot juice 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.569
 vegetables cabbage for example has many 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.869
 vitamins that enhance 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.449
 the solar option then when 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:06.969
 we are very white we always have to 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.709
 prepare us with an addition more than 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.279
 protection factor we are going to buy 

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:16.330
 good protection factors can 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:18.879
 be or very protect a lot or that 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.839
 protect in a medium way that bronze 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:25.300
 to always start a protection 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:28.780
 medium-high a medium-high protection by 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.790
 at least a 20 or a 30 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.610
 there are products that serve the body 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.920
 and the face and products that are only 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.860
 for the body and exclusive only of 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.040
 the face I recommend that you start 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.409
 always for two different products 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.289
 they are usually very very pasty creams 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:52.019
 they stay very rusty on the skin and give 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:56.050
 a very uncomfortable feeling these 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:59.090
 products that are the physical ones 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.220
 normally they do not let anything happen 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.920
 no sun I left a movie 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.930
 whitish that's because it has a lot 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.690
 titanium dioxide that is truly 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.030
 the screen the titanium dioxide is what 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.730
 that truly makes it reflect 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.640
 totally the sun what happens that like 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.610
 now people do not like to go so 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.800
 pringosos good as the Chemists 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.700
 what they have done is add dioxide say 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.040
 they make them more fluid 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.730
 they are more fluid more claritas more 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.360
 Transparent total protections 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:36.250
 how will not let us spend any sun 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.909
 at the beginning it is convenient that 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.900
 let's start with something like this something high and then 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.060
 let's move on to more average protection 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.030
 800 organics that already pass the 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.580
 grape rays but prevent baby uv rays 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.979
 baby are those who burn those who 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.909
 produce redness what they produce 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:02.650
 granites all the discomforts of the 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:04.930
 skin and the one that mazÃ³n the grape those are the 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.550
 tanning rays you have more or 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.219
 less an orientation how much can 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.319
 be exposed to the sun with the protector 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:15.270
 that I bought if I bought a 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:19.990
 medium protector that is 15 or 20 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.639
 multiply by 10 150 minutes or 200 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.430
 minutes that's what I'm going to be 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.650
 relatively protected is not 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.289
 exact but at least we have a 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.219
 orientation how many how much rat 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.219
 we can be the sun
