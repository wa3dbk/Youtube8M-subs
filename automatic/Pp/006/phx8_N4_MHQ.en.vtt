 first place among scientists of the last century 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.900
 his contribution to physics is simply impossible 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.759

 Feynman 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.899

 the idea that in the future mankind 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.310
 will need to build a huge scope 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.170
 now it is called the dyson sphere 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.650
 which includes all solar 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.819
 system in order to as possible 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.000
 more efficient use of solar 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.040
