going to show you guys how to rig it so

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.650 
going to show you guys how to rig it so
first<00:00:30.720> off<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.140> I've<00:00:31.289> got<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.910> is<00:00:32.910> Gamakatsu

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
first off what I've got is is Gamakatsu

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
first off what I've got is is Gamakatsu
hooks<00:00:34.230> therefore<00:00:34.860> OTT<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:36.059> barbs<00:00:36.390> are

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
hooks therefore OTT the barbs are

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.770 
hooks therefore OTT the barbs are
pinched<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.610> they're<00:00:38.610> they're<00:00:39.090> solid<00:00:39.570> tie

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
pinched on and they're they're solid tie

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.979 
pinched on and they're they're solid tie
and<00:00:40.550> spacing<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:42.600> people<00:00:42.719> would

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and spacing on them so some people would

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.479 
and spacing on them so some people would
might<00:00:43.140> use<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> bigger<00:00:43.590> hook<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.950> front<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
might use a bigger hook up front but I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
might use a bigger hook up front but I
don't<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.360> simplicity<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> used<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
don't I just for simplicity I used to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:46.850 
don't I just for simplicity I used to
for<00:00:46.590> Ott's

for Ott's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.420 
for Ott's
or<00:00:47.700> even<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.180> 3x<00:00:48.800> spacing<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> three

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
or even to 3x spacing two to three

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.450 
or even to 3x spacing two to three
inches<00:00:50.670> apart<00:00:50.789> again<00:00:51.360> solid<00:00:51.840> tie<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.559> 25

there it is so now the key to the whole

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.969 
there it is so now the key to the whole
herring<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.560> now

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.080 
it and you're going to put a little half
inch<00:01:48.049> around<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> herrings<00:01:49.560> nose<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
inch around the herrings nose like that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
inch around the herrings nose like that
and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.350> first<00:01:52.590> half<00:01:52.920> hitch<00:01:53.159> allows

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and then that first half hitch allows

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
and then that first half hitch allows
you<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> pull<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.479> tighten

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you to kind of pull and tighten

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
you to kind of pull and tighten
everything<00:01:55.439> up<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.280> create<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.579> Bend

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
everything up and to create that Bend

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.940 
everything up and to create that Bend
now<00:01:57.930> you're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> second<00:01:58.770> half

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
now you're going to do a second half

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.209 
now you're going to do a second half
hitch<00:01:59.420> to<00:02:00.420> kind<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> complete<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> snug

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
hitch to kind of complete the the snug

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.550 
hitch to kind of complete the the snug
down<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.570> nose<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.439> actually

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
down of the nose and that will actually

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
down of the nose and that will actually
hold<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> position<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
hold it in the position you want and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.229 
hold it in the position you want and
keep<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.200> snug<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.090> there

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
keep it snug and there you go so there

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.460 
keep it snug and there you go so there
there<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.679> whole<00:02:10.860> herring

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
there is the whole herring

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.700 
there is the whole herring
choked<00:02:12.950> rigged<00:02:13.790> Faurot<00:02:14.420> seta<00:02:14.990> so<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> think<00:02:15.380> the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
choked rigged Faurot seta so I think the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.430 
choked rigged Faurot seta so I think the
biggest<00:02:15.920> benefit<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.450> choked<00:02:18.050> hearing

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
biggest benefit of the choked hearing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.470 
biggest benefit of the choked hearing
