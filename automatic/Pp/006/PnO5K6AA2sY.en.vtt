for<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.349> no<00:00:31.500> idea<00:00:31.769> what's<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.160> on

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
for you we have no idea what's going on

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.530 
for you we have no idea what's going on
but<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.000> take<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> machine

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
but that's where we take the machine

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.740 
but that's where we take the machine
into<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.960> tech<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.790> this<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.329> haven't<00:00:36.480> solved

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750

it<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.370> last<00:00:38.579> part<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.270> only<00:00:39.629> 5%

usually<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.010> don't<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.610> far

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
top into the machine so you think okay

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.300

can<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> put<00:04:00.239> this<00:04:00.330> on<00:04:00.510> my<00:04:00.540> vertical<00:04:00.930> pin<00:04:01.310> it

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
can I put this on my vertical pin it

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.890 
can I put this on my vertical pin it
goes<00:04:02.489> vertical<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.030> comes<00:04:03.180> off<00:04:03.300> this<00:04:03.450> way<00:04:03.600> yeah

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
goes vertical it comes off this way yeah

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.320
