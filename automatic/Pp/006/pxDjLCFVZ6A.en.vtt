00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.189 

camshaft<00:00:14.730> sensor<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.420> actually<00:00:15.599> right<00:00:15.929> here

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
camshaft sensor is actually right here

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980 
camshaft sensor is actually right here
pretty<00:00:16.320> easy<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.650> get<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.480> using<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.840> ratchet

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
pretty easy to get to so using a ratchet

to<00:00:22.769> move<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> couple<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.310> hoses<00:00:23.580> out<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to move a couple these hoses out of the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.210 
to move a couple these hoses out of the
way<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:25.080> kidding<00:00:25.380> least<00:00:25.619> slide<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
way just kidding least slide on this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
way just kidding least slide on this
light<00:00:26.460> off<00:00:26.750> it's<00:00:27.750> gonna<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.930> easier<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> unbolt

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
light off it's gonna be easier to unbolt

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.349 
light off it's gonna be easier to unbolt
it<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.250> pull<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.910> disconnect

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
it and then pull it up and disconnect

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.860 
it and then pull it up and disconnect
the<00:00:30.630> wiring<00:00:30.840> connector<00:00:32.059> in<00:00:33.059> our<00:00:33.239> hands<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the wiring connector in our hands a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.110 
the wiring connector in our hands a
little<00:00:34.079> higher<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:35.820> we're

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
little higher up so as you can see we're

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.069 
little higher up so as you can see we're
just<00:00:36.149> loosening<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> 2<00:00:37.200> 8<00:00:37.440> millimeter<00:00:37.890> bolts

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
just loosening the 2 8 millimeter bolts

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
just loosening the 2 8 millimeter bolts
like<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.379> we'll<00:00:40.739> take<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> way<00:00:41.399> out

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
like so we'll take them all the way out

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.380 
like so we'll take them all the way out
and<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.120> we'll<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:44.120> sensor<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> our

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and then we'll have the sensor in our

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.650 
and then we'll have the sensor in our
hand<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.899> again<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.890> 8<00:00:47.309> millimeter<00:00:47.789> bolts

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.700 

2<00:00:51.660> bolts<00:00:51.840> are<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> pulls

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
2 bolts are out it just kind of pulls

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.490 
2 bolts are out it just kind of pulls
off<00:00:52.949> oh<00:00:53.250> yeah<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.449> nice<00:00:54.980> easy<00:00:55.980> access

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
off oh yeah that's nice easy access

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.660 
off oh yeah that's nice easy access
these<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.680> some<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:59.039> videos<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
these are some other videos for the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.729 
these are some other videos for the
connector<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> very<00:01:01.379> common<00:01:01.710> for

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
connector and this is very common for

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.179 
connector and this is very common for
this<00:01:02.010> gasket<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.699> leak<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> norse

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
this gasket to leak on here the norse

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
this gasket to leak on here the norse
can<00:01:05.400> order<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> whole<00:01:06.180> new<00:01:06.330> sensor<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
can order a whole new sensor or you can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
can order a whole new sensor or you can
maybe<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:07.830> silicone<00:01:08.430> around<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.970> as

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
maybe use some silicone around there as

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.870 
maybe use some silicone around there as
long<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> sensors<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.110> failing<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.130> seal

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
long as the sensors not failing and seal

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
long as the sensors not failing and seal
that<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.510> well<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> new<00:01:13.290> sensor

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that back up well we have a new sensor

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.359 
that back up well we have a new sensor
and<00:01:13.920> new<00:01:14.100> gasket<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:16.759> we<00:01:17.759> need<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:19.369> take

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and new gasket with it we need to take

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.940 
and new gasket with it we need to take
this<00:01:20.549> red<00:01:21.140> keeper<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> push

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
this red keeper here and we need to push

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.420 
this red keeper here and we need to push
it<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.659> unlock<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> tab

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
it to the right to unlock it the tab

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.429 
it to the right to unlock it the tab
[Applause]

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
[Applause]

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.250 
[Applause]
usually<00:01:31.439> use<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> small<00:01:32.009> screw<00:01:32.310> driver

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:47.370 

push<00:01:37.260> it<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.710> side<00:01:38.450> push<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.630> tab

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.399 

disconnected

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.649 

got<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.979> new<00:01:55.159> sensor

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.620 

locking<00:02:02.659> into<00:02:02.780> place<00:02:04.060> push<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.210> tab<00:02:05.360> over

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
locking into place push the tab over

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.340 
locking into place push the tab over
there<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.900> go<00:02:08.890> gonna<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:10.069> gasket<00:02:10.490> so<00:02:10.670> we<00:02:10.759> just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
there we go gonna do gasket so we just

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.690 
there we go gonna do gasket so we just
will<00:02:12.350> clean<00:02:12.530> off<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.860> surface<00:02:13.220> area<00:02:13.520> that

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
will clean off the surface area that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.280 
will clean off the surface area that
this<00:02:13.819> mounts<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.300> with<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> rag<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.110> we'll

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
this mounts to with a rag and then we'll

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.890 
this mounts to with a rag and then we'll
bolt<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.920> up<00:02:16.300> that's<00:02:17.300> really<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.750> have<00:02:17.780> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
bolt it up that's really all you have to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
bolt it up that's really all you have to
do<00:02:18.020> very<00:02:18.830> nice<00:02:19.069> easy<00:02:19.340> cam<00:02:20.060> sensor<00:02:20.920> replacement

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920
