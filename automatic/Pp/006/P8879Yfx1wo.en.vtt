00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
because it was driving me nuts

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.090 
because it was driving me nuts
her<00:01:13.840> head<00:01:14.020> was<00:01:14.140> just<00:01:14.320> flopping<00:01:14.590> all<00:01:14.830> over<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
her head was just flopping all over the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.650 
her head was just flopping all over the
place<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.550> it's<00:01:15.729> not<00:01:15.850> because<00:01:16.119> she's<00:01:16.330> loosely

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
place and it's not because she's loosely

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.630 
place and it's not because she's loosely
strung<00:01:17.160> it's<00:01:18.160> because<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:20.310> Plus<00:01:21.310> shaped

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
strung it's because of this Plus shaped

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.260 
strung it's because of this Plus shaped
hole<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.360> her<00:01:22.479> neck<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:24.280> nice<00:01:24.490> because

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
hole in her neck and it's nice because

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.290 
hole in her neck and it's nice because
it<00:01:25.540> gives<00:01:25.570> her<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:26.200> lot<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.619> range<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.430> her<00:01:28.090> head

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
it gives her a lot of range but her head

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.330 
it gives her a lot of range but her head
just<00:01:28.330> wants<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.050> go<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.830> sides<00:01:30.070> and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
just wants to go in the sides and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.620 
just wants to go in the sides and
doesn't<00:01:30.580> want<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.759> stay<00:01:30.910> in<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> middle<00:01:31.240> and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
doesn't want to stay in the middle and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.840 
doesn't want to stay in the middle and
the<00:01:32.320> Kip<00:01:32.500> didn't<00:01:32.710> last<00:01:32.860> very<00:01:32.979> long<00:01:33.190> because<00:01:33.610> it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the Kip didn't last very long because it

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.730 
the Kip didn't last very long because it
kind<00:01:34.030> of<00:01:34.090> sunk<00:01:34.360> into<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.750> hole<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.259> conformed

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
kind of sunk into the hole and conformed

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.650 
kind of sunk into the hole and conformed
to<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.860> shape<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.940> after<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.300> while<00:01:37.479> was

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
to that shape so after a while was

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.080 
to that shape so after a while was
pretty<00:01:37.899> useless<00:01:38.399> so<00:01:39.399> I've<00:01:39.640> removed<00:01:39.790> that

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
pretty useless so I've removed that

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.850 
pretty useless so I've removed that
since<00:01:40.420> then<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.869> I've<00:01:40.990> swated<00:01:41.410> her<00:01:41.500> neck<00:01:41.680> and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
since then and I've swated her neck and

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.890 
since then and I've swated her neck and
now<00:01:41.979> it's<00:01:42.160> fine<00:01:42.340> she<00:01:45.180> has<00:01:46.180> really<00:01:46.600> really<00:01:46.750> good

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
now it's fine she has really really good

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.010 
now it's fine she has really really good
range<00:01:47.460> she<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.580> move<00:01:48.670> her<00:01:48.729> head<00:01:48.880> all<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.120> way

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.010 

all<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.080> way<00:01:53.320> forward

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.570 

don't<00:01:57.590> think<00:01:57.830> Schiele<00:01:58.040> can't<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.370> his<00:01:58.460> move

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
don't think Schiele can't do his move

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.970 
don't think Schiele can't do his move
her<00:01:58.700> head<00:01:58.820> very<00:01:58.970> far<00:01:59.210> back<00:01:59.390> but<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:00.470> decent

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.779 

her<00:02:03.980> shoulders<00:02:07.330> have<00:02:08.330> an<00:02:08.509> l-shaped<00:02:09.610> groove<00:02:10.610> in

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
her shoulders have an l-shaped groove in

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.540 
her shoulders have an l-shaped groove in
there<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:12.590> seems<00:02:12.860> kind<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.100> pointless<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
there and it seems kind of pointless to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.600 
there and it seems kind of pointless to
me<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.730> doesn't<00:02:13.880> really<00:02:14.000> seem<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:15.610> positively

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
me it doesn't really seem to positively

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.760 
me it doesn't really seem to positively
affect<00:02:17.000> her<00:02:17.420> arm<00:02:18.370> or<00:02:19.370> her<00:02:19.490> shoulder<00:02:20.770> because

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
affect her arm or her shoulder because

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.140 
affect her arm or her shoulder because
the<00:02:21.950> strings<00:02:22.250> never<00:02:22.490> gonna<00:02:22.700> go<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:23.060> that

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the strings never gonna go in that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150 
the strings never gonna go in that
direction<00:02:23.330> anyway<00:02:23.900> unless<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.860> pull<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.100> out

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
direction anyway unless you pull it out

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.580 
direction anyway unless you pull it out
like<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.400> did<00:02:28.180> her<00:02:29.180> elbows<00:02:29.600> are<00:02:29.930> single<00:02:30.230> jointed

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
like I did her elbows are single jointed

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.430 
like I did her elbows are single jointed
and<00:02:30.850> they're<00:02:31.850> pretty<00:02:32.270> unusual<00:02:32.540> if<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.290> look

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
and they're pretty unusual if you look

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.990 
and they're pretty unusual if you look
at<00:02:33.590> him<00:02:33.709> that's<00:02:33.860> as<00:02:34.040> far<00:02:34.250> as<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:34.700> straighten

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
at him that's as far as I can straighten

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.030 
at him that's as far as I can straighten
them<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.140> she<00:02:36.200> can't<00:02:36.500> keep<00:02:36.650> him<00:02:36.830> straight

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
them so she can't keep him straight

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.520 
them so she can't keep him straight
they're<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.400> permanently<00:02:37.820> bent<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> that's

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
they're just permanently bent so that's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.670 
they're just permanently bent so that's
a<00:02:39.590> little<00:02:39.739> odd<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.100> when<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.280> do<00:02:40.400> bend<00:02:40.670> it

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
a little odd and when you do bend it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.770 
a little odd and when you do bend it
it's<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:43.970> being<00:02:44.239> pulled<00:02:44.570> out<00:02:44.720> of

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
it's like it's just being pulled out of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.949 
it's like it's just being pulled out of
the<00:02:44.900> socket<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:47.300> looks<00:02:47.480> really<00:02:47.630> strange

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the socket so this looks really strange

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.449 
the socket so this looks really strange
I<00:02:48.230> don't<00:02:48.290> know<00:02:48.500> why<00:02:48.650> they<00:02:48.830> designed<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.280> that

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
I don't know why they designed it that

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.300 
I don't know why they designed it that
way<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:50.480> pretty<00:02:50.660> unnecessary<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:52.160> other

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
way it's pretty unnecessary but other

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.640 
way it's pretty unnecessary but other
than<00:02:52.520> those<00:02:52.700> two<00:02:52.880> issues<00:02:53.110> she<00:02:54.110> could<00:02:54.260> pivot<00:02:54.410> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
than those two issues she could pivot it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:03.430 
than those two issues she could pivot it
and<00:02:54.830> move<00:02:54.920> around<00:02:55.190> she<00:02:55.370> wants<00:02:58.600> her<00:02:59.600> wrists<00:03:02.440> you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
and move around she wants her wrists you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.900 
and move around she wants her wrists you
first<00:03:03.709> look<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:03.950> her<00:03:04.040> wrists<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.580> might<00:03:04.790> look

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
first look at her wrists it might look

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.729 
first look at her wrists it might look
like<00:03:04.970> there's<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.540> separate<00:03:05.840> ball<00:03:06.019> point<00:03:06.320> her

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
like there's a separate ball point her

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.250 
like there's a separate ball point her
ball<00:03:07.190> joint<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:07.850> there<00:03:08.049> but<00:03:09.049> it's<00:03:09.170> actually

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
ball joint in there but it's actually

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.670 
ball joint in there but it's actually
just<00:03:09.470> attached<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.980> her<00:03:10.100> hand<00:03:11.470> she<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.560> move

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
just attached to her hand she can move

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.770 
just attached to her hand she can move
it<00:03:12.769> all<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.890> way<00:03:13.070> back<00:03:16.269> pretty<00:03:17.269> far<00:03:17.480> forward

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.240 

and<00:03:21.780> side<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.140> side<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.349> little<00:03:22.500> bit<00:03:25.220> now<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and side to side a little bit now I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.630 
and side to side a little bit now I
would<00:03:26.550> consider<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:28.069> waste<00:03:29.069> joint<00:03:29.430> even

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
would consider this a waste joint even

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.820 
would consider this a waste joint even
though<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:29.819> below<00:03:30.060> her<00:03:30.209> waist<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:31.530> like

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
though it's below her waist I don't like

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.380 
though it's below her waist I don't like
the<00:03:32.250> look<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.670> cuz<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.000> just<00:03:33.030> looks<00:03:33.300> like

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
the look of it cuz it just looks like

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.589 
the look of it cuz it just looks like
she's<00:03:34.170> been<00:03:34.319> sliced<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.769> half<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.599> the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
she's been sliced in half and the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.880 
she's been sliced in half and the
tension<00:03:36.959> stirring<00:03:37.200> kind<00:03:37.379> of<00:03:37.440> forces<00:03:37.769> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
tension stirring kind of forces it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.520 
tension stirring kind of forces it
forward<00:03:38.280> which<00:03:39.090> isn't<00:03:39.269> good<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:40.110> even

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
forward which isn't good and even

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.869 
forward which isn't good and even
Sweeting<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.220> think<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.580> would<00:03:41.760> help

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
Sweeting I don't think that would help

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.610 
Sweeting I don't think that would help
either<00:03:42.090> that's<00:03:42.599> just<00:03:42.810> something<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.379> have<00:03:43.530> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
either that's just something you have to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.110 
either that's just something you have to
deal<00:03:43.799> with<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:46.260> can't<00:03:46.530> move<00:03:46.709> far<00:03:47.610> back<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.000> she

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
deal with it can't move far back and she

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.660 
deal with it can't move far back and she
already<00:03:48.239> has<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.959> far<00:03:49.920> natural<00:03:50.250> lean

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
already has a really far natural lean

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.309 
already has a really far natural lean
anyway<00:03:51.380> but<00:03:52.380> what<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.650> really<00:03:52.799> useful<00:03:53.250> for

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
anyway but what it's really useful for

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.400 
anyway but what it's really useful for
is<00:03:55.319> just<00:03:55.500> popping<00:03:55.799> forward<00:03:56.069> like<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.220> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
is just popping forward like that and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.960 
is just popping forward like that and
that<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.620> really<00:03:59.010> useful<00:03:59.250> when<00:03:59.519> she's<00:03:59.700> sitting

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
that is really useful when she's sitting

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.770 
that is really useful when she's sitting
down<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:02.400> looks<00:04:02.640> terrible<00:04:02.940> from<00:04:03.299> back<00:04:03.450> here

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
down it looks terrible from back here

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.600 
down it looks terrible from back here
but<00:04:04.620> hopefully<00:04:04.950> she'll<00:04:05.129> be<00:04:05.190> wearing<00:04:05.400> clothes

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
but hopefully she'll be wearing clothes

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.050 
but hopefully she'll be wearing clothes
anyway<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:08.099> can<00:04:08.220> move<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.459> side<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.849> side<00:04:09.030> a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
anyway you can move it to side to side a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.800 
anyway you can move it to side to side a
little<00:04:09.150> bit<00:04:09.329> too<00:04:09.599> but<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:12.510> looks<00:04:12.750> strange

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
little bit too but just looks strange

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.259 
little bit too but just looks strange
now<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:16.200> part<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.130> her<00:04:17.220> body<00:04:17.340> her<00:04:17.700> hip<00:04:17.850> joints

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
now this part of her body her hip joints

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.110 
now this part of her body her hip joints
is<00:04:18.900> an<00:04:19.229> issue<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.739> have<00:04:20.010> because<00:04:20.430> they're

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
is an issue that I have because they're

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.150 
is an issue that I have because they're
just<00:04:21.329> crazy<00:04:21.600> wonky<00:04:22.350> want<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.650> go<00:04:22.740> everywhere

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
just crazy wonky want to go everywhere

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.840 
just crazy wonky want to go everywhere
it's<00:04:23.639> even<00:04:23.850> worse<00:04:24.000> than<00:04:24.210> her<00:04:24.330> neck<00:04:25.850> it's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
it's even worse than her neck it's

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.370 
it's even worse than her neck it's
supposed<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> be<00:04:27.300> here<00:04:28.639> as<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:29.729> can<00:04:29.760> see<00:04:30.380> it

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
supposed to be here as you can see it

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.969 
supposed to be here as you can see it
has<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.560> cross<00:04:31.919> shaped<00:04:32.360> hole<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:34.289> I

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
has a cross shaped hole there and I

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.210 
has a cross shaped hole there and I
don't<00:04:35.190> really<00:04:35.340> know<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.580> purpose<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:37.220> you

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
don't really know the purpose of the you

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.589 
don't really know the purpose of the you
know<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.550> having<00:04:38.760> all<00:04:38.940> those<00:04:39.060> grooves<00:04:39.419> there

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
know of having all those grooves there

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.529 
know of having all those grooves there
because<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:40.820> one<00:04:41.820> in<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.030> front<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.389> long

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
because this one in the front the long

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.870 
because this one in the front the long
one<00:04:42.780> is<00:04:43.190> really<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.280> only<00:04:44.460> one<00:04:44.610> you're<00:04:44.760> going

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
one is really the only one you're going

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.219 
one is really the only one you're going
to<00:04:44.940> use<00:04:46.099> so<00:04:47.099> with<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.630> she<00:04:48.630> could<00:04:48.750> set<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> 90

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
to use so with that she could set a 90

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.290 
to use so with that she could set a 90
degree<00:04:49.440> angle<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.880> see<00:04:50.880> what<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.120> mean<00:04:51.240> about

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
degree angle you see what I mean about

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.969 
degree angle you see what I mean about
that<00:04:51.450> lean<00:04:51.690> looks<00:04:52.289> a<00:04:52.349> lot<00:04:52.440> better<00:04:52.620> when<00:04:52.800> she's

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
that lean looks a lot better when she's

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.290 
that lean looks a lot better when she's
pulled<00:04:53.220> forward

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.910 

and<00:04:58.110> she<00:04:58.440> can<00:05:00.110> spread<00:05:01.110> her<00:05:01.230> legs<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:01.650> check<00:05:01.890> she

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
and she can spread her legs in check she

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.590 
and she can spread her legs in check she
sees<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.490> way<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.820> that's<00:05:08.970> really<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.570> I

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
sees that way and that's really it I

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.970 
sees that way and that's really it I
mean<00:05:09.870> she<00:05:10.140> can't<00:05:10.970> move<00:05:11.970> back<00:05:12.680> but<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.800> thing

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
mean she can't move back but the thing

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.750 
mean she can't move back but the thing
is<00:05:15.410> when<00:05:16.410> she's<00:05:16.650> just<00:05:16.710> standing<00:05:17.130> normally

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
is when she's just standing normally

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.790 
is when she's just standing normally
they<00:05:18.060> want<00:05:18.480> you<00:05:18.840> know<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.140> string<00:05:19.410> wants<00:05:19.710> to

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
they want you know the string wants to

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.490 
they want you know the string wants to
go<00:05:19.920> into<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.250> back<00:05:20.580> groove<00:05:21.230> so<00:05:22.230> it<00:05:22.350> just

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
go into that back groove so it just

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.960 
go into that back groove so it just
makes<00:05:22.710> her<00:05:22.860> thighs<00:05:23.130> stick<00:05:23.490> out<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:23.850> just

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
makes her thighs stick out and just

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.960 
makes her thighs stick out and just
looks<00:05:24.180> really<00:05:24.330> weird<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.430> think<00:05:26.670> that's

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
looks really weird so I think that's

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.070 
looks really weird so I think that's
pretty<00:05:27.120> unnecessary<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:29.550> whole<00:05:29.730> system<00:05:30.080> she

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
pretty unnecessary that whole system she

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.070 
pretty unnecessary that whole system she
has<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.290> femoral<00:05:31.770> joint<00:05:31.940> which<00:05:32.940> when<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.870> first

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
has a femoral joint which when you first

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.510 
has a femoral joint which when you first
look<00:05:34.260> at<00:05:34.380> it<00:05:34.500> you<00:05:34.530> know<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:35.250> might<00:05:35.400> just

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
look at it you know you might just

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.890 
look at it you know you might just
assume<00:05:35.670> that<00:05:36.000> her<00:05:36.120> legs<00:05:36.270> gonna<00:05:36.450> be<00:05:36.630> moving

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
assume that her legs gonna be moving

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.920 
assume that her legs gonna be moving
everywhere<00:05:37.290> just<00:05:37.800> like<00:05:38.040> this<00:05:38.190> part<00:05:38.780> but<00:05:39.780> it

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
everywhere just like this part but it

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.700 
everywhere just like this part but it
has<00:05:40.490> this<00:05:41.490> little<00:05:41.670> nub<00:05:41.910> in<00:05:42.090> there<00:05:42.560> and<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.650> don't

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
has this little nub in there and I don't

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.110 
has this little nub in there and I don't
know<00:05:43.860> if<00:05:43.980> you<00:05:44.100> know<00:05:44.160> how<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.310> see<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.580> but

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
know if you know how to see it but

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.500 
know if you know how to see it but
there's<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.360> groove<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.930> where<00:05:46.890> it<00:05:46.980> fits<00:05:47.160> into

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
there's a groove to where it fits into

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.250 
there's a groove to where it fits into
and<00:05:48.510> it<00:05:48.840> gives<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.140> some<00:05:49.380> tolerance<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:50.040> move

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
and it gives it some tolerance to move

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.800 
and it gives it some tolerance to move
but<00:05:52.260> it<00:05:52.380> still<00:05:52.590> keeps<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.950> in<00:05:53.040> place<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:53.810> I'm

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
but it still keeps it in place so I'm

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.000 
but it still keeps it in place so I'm
really<00:05:54.990> glad<00:05:55.080> they<00:05:55.290> did<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:55.650> think<00:05:55.920> that's

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
really glad they did that I think that's

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.460 
really glad they did that I think that's
nice<00:05:59.960> her<00:06:00.960> knees<00:06:01.260> nothing<00:06:02.190> special

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
nice her knees nothing special

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.800 
nice her knees nothing special
single<00:06:04.470> jointed<00:06:05.180> typical<00:06:06.180> hinge<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:09.060> her

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
single jointed typical hinge and her

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.750 
single jointed typical hinge and her
ankles<00:06:10.200> much<00:06:10.710> like<00:06:10.920> her<00:06:11.100> wrists<00:06:11.490> when<00:06:11.670> you

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
ankles much like her wrists when you

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.520 
ankles much like her wrists when you
first<00:06:11.940> look<00:06:12.150> at<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.420> it<00:06:12.630> might<00:06:13.350> look<00:06:13.470> like

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
first look at it it might look like

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.900 
first look at it it might look like
that's<00:06:13.950> a<00:06:14.100> separate<00:06:14.430> piece<00:06:14.610> but<00:06:14.790> it's

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
that's a separate piece but it's

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.480 
that's a separate piece but it's
actually<00:06:15.180> just<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.420> type<00:06:15.600> of<00:06:15.630> foot<00:06:15.960> and<00:06:16.490> her

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
actually just a type of foot and her

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.240 
actually just a type of foot and her
range<00:06:17.670> is<00:06:17.820> pretty<00:06:17.940> decent<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:19.740> does<00:06:19.950> kind<00:06:20.190> of

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
range is pretty decent it does kind of

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.620 
range is pretty decent it does kind of
want<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.400> snap<00:06:20.610> back<00:06:20.640> so<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.120> think<00:06:21.210> Sweeting

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
want to snap back so I think Sweeting

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.780 
want to snap back so I think Sweeting
would<00:06:21.750> help<00:06:21.930> that<00:06:23.150> should<00:06:24.150> move<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.360> side<00:06:24.540> side

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
would help that should move it side side

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:37.600 
would help that should move it side side
as<00:06:26.790> you<00:06:27.030> turn<00:06:27.240> it

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.159 

so<00:06:38.599> like<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:38.870> said<00:06:38.930> I<00:06:39.379> do<00:06:40.180> appreciate<00:06:41.180> Momoko's

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
so like I said I do appreciate Momoko's

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.860 
so like I said I do appreciate Momoko's
efforts<00:06:42.620> on<00:06:42.770> this<00:06:42.889> body<00:06:43.129> I<00:06:43.430> do<00:06:44.060> like<00:06:44.449> it<00:06:44.659> I<00:06:44.840> just

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
efforts on this body I do like it I just

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.730 
efforts on this body I do like it I just
wish<00:06:45.349> it<00:06:45.379> didn't<00:06:45.710> have<00:06:45.830> this<00:06:45.949> craziness<00:06:47.740> this

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
wish it didn't have this craziness this

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.679 
wish it didn't have this craziness this
was<00:06:48.919> fun<00:06:49.099> once<00:06:49.280> I<00:06:49.370> sweated<00:06:49.669> it<00:06:49.879> so<00:06:50.599> I<00:06:50.629> don't

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689 
was fun once I sweated it so I don't

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.149 
was fun once I sweated it so I don't
really<00:06:50.900> have<00:06:50.990> an<00:06:51.080> issue<00:06:51.169> with<00:06:51.349> that<00:06:51.409> and<00:06:51.770> her

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:52.159 
really have an issue with that and her

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.200 
really have an issue with that and her
arms<00:06:52.689> not<00:06:53.689> being<00:06:53.960> able<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.229> straighten<00:06:54.530> out

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
arms not being able to straighten out

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.570 
arms not being able to straighten out
that's<00:06:56.210> an<00:06:56.360> issue<00:06:56.530> but<00:06:57.530> anyway<00:06:57.830> that's<00:06:57.979> it<00:06:58.400> for

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
that's an issue but anyway that's it for
