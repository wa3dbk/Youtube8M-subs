happier so we have small flipper number

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.620 
happier so we have small flipper number
four<00:00:33.230> with<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.309> color<00:00:35.309> de<00:00:35.550> draak<00:00:35.910> pattern<00:00:36.480> or

four with the color de draak pattern or

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.450 
four with the color de draak pattern or
natural<00:00:37.110> part<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.559> don't<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.219> be

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
considered there you can see that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.790 
considered there you can see that
pattern<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> pretty<00:00:42.750> nice<00:00:42.989> matching

kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> pattern<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.800> change<00:00:50.280> those

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
kind of pattern and then I change those

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.270 
kind of pattern and then I change those
floods<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> give<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.690> two-tone<00:00:52.469> color

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

when<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.680> nice<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:19.979> clean<00:01:20.400> pristine<00:01:20.900> it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
when it's nice and clean pristine it's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
when it's nice and clean pristine it's
not<00:01:22.049> fun<00:01:22.290> doing<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:22.920> Tomas<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
not fun doing this because Tomas was to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
not fun doing this because Tomas was to
make<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> nice<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> especially<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> pattern

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
make it nice and especially the pattern

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.120 
make it nice and especially the pattern
it<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.409> perfectly<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it has to be perfectly you know like

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
it has to be perfectly you know like
smooth<00:01:29.520> mirror<00:01:29.909> polish<00:01:30.360> pretty<00:01:30.689> much<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.340> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
smooth mirror polish pretty much and so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
smooth mirror polish pretty much and so
imagine<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.210> rock<00:01:33.479> pattern

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
imagine you have all that rock pattern

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
imagine you have all that rock pattern
that<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> start<00:01:35.880> off

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that you actually you know you start off

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.760 
that you actually you know you start off
with<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> ruffle<00:01:36.600> grinds<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> actually

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
with the ruffle grinds but you actually

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
with the ruffle grinds but you actually
have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.280> work<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.939> copy<00:01:39.240> each<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have to work and just copy each and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.830 
have to work and just copy each and
every<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.680> groove<00:01:40.950> finer<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> finer<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
every little groove finer and finer and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.560 
every little groove finer and finer and
I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.409> stopped<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.829> 400<00:01:44.490> or<00:01:44.610> 500<00:01:44.850> silicon

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I think I stopped at 400 or 500 silicon

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
I think I stopped at 400 or 500 silicon
carbide<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.229> buff<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.880> bit

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
carbide and then buff it up a little bit

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
carbide and then buff it up a little bit
of<00:01:48.180> scotch<00:01:48.420> brite<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.009> disgorge<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.280> actually

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
of scotch brite to disgorge but actually

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.810 
of scotch brite to disgorge but actually
helps<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> lot<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:52.110> removes<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> last<00:01:53.280> little

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
helps a lot it removes the last little

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.550 
helps a lot it removes the last little
leftovers<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.780> might<00:01:55.049> miss<00:01:55.259> because

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
leftovers that you might miss because

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950 
leftovers that you might miss because
it's<00:01:55.619> almost<00:01:55.979> impossible<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.390> hit<00:01:57.780> them

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's almost impossible to to hit them

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.490 
it's almost impossible to to hit them
perfectly<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.140> masks

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
perfectly and as you see the masks

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
perfectly and as you see the masks
pocket<00:02:01.890> clip<00:02:02.100> kinda<00:02:02.759> nice<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:03.090> also<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
pocket clip kinda nice one also has that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.270 
pocket clip kinda nice one also has that
little<00:02:05.149> grooves<00:02:05.479> like<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.590> go<00:02:06.740> with<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.039> team

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
little grooves like to go with the team

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.900 
little grooves like to go with the team
nice<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.420> thin<00:02:08.629> oh<00:02:08.660> very<00:02:08.989> works<00:02:09.470> really<00:02:09.739> well

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
nice and thin oh very works really well

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.640 
nice and thin oh very works really well
also<00:02:10.910> works<00:02:11.209> like<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.540> over<00:02:12.110> travel<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
also works like that over travel a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.619 
also works like that over travel a
little<00:02:12.739> bit<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.129> know<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.610> over<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.150> over

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
little bit you know it is over the over

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.839 
little bit you know it is over the over
the<00:02:14.660> log<00:02:14.900> bar<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:16.190> top<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.400> off<00:02:16.640> actually

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
the log bar and to top it off actually

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.940 
the log bar and to top it off actually
on<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.239> end<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.720> decided<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.500> had<00:02:18.650> little

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
on the end I decided that I had little

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.430 
on the end I decided that I had little
left<00:02:19.190> over<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.760> what<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> did<00:02:20.209> was<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:21.230> back

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
left over and what I did was the back

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.250 
left over and what I did was the back
spacer<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> titanium<00:02:24.140> is

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
spacer and because the titanium is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.369 
spacer and because the titanium is
thinner<00:02:24.620> than<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.430> space<00:02:26.239> between<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
thinner than the space between the

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.680 
thinner than the space between the
scales<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.769> I<00:02:27.950> need<00:02:28.220> use<00:02:28.430> what<00:02:29.209> i<00:02:29.239> did<00:02:29.510> was

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
scales that I need use what i did was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.839 
scales that I need use what i did was
actually<00:02:30.200> kinda<00:02:30.799> press-fitted<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.700> then

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
actually kinda press-fitted and then

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.150 
actually kinda press-fitted and then
just<00:02:32.060> out<00:02:32.299> of<00:02:32.510> crazy<00:02:32.900> glow<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.500> make<00:02:33.739> make

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
just out of crazy glow just to make make

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.880 
just out of crazy glow just to make make
sure<00:02:34.430> it's<00:02:35.299> actually<00:02:35.810> nice<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.319> sitting

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
sure it's actually nice it's sitting

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.569 
sure it's actually nice it's sitting
it's<00:02:37.190> press-fitted<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:39.250> persuaded<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
it's press-fitted on persuaded on the

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.610 
it's press-fitted on persuaded on the
one<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.030> back<00:02:41.209> standoffs<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.440> other

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
one of the back standoffs and the other

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.440 
one of the back standoffs and the other
one<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.160> around<00:02:43.459> kind<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.060> copies

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
one is just around kind of like copies

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.490 
one is just around kind of like copies
it<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> small<00:02:45.829> piece<00:02:47.019> but<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.260> works

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
it is it was a small piece but it works

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.259 
it is it was a small piece but it works
good<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.099> kind<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.519> suspended<00:02:50.150> in

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
good so it's kind of like suspended in

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.539 
good so it's kind of like suspended in
the<00:02:50.329> middle<00:02:50.660> as<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.079> see<00:02:51.319> there<00:02:51.560> which<00:02:52.370> is

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
the middle as you see there which is

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.150 
the middle as you see there which is
pretty<00:02:53.239> nice<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.810> do<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.680> think<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.069> a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
pretty nice I do like it I think it's a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.729 
pretty nice I do like it I think it's a
cool<00:02:55.370> cool<00:02:55.819> feature<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.959> also<00:02:57.140> has<00:02:57.349> a<00:02:57.470> drop

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
cool cool feature and it also has a drop

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.180 
cool cool feature and it also has a drop
pattern<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.340> kind<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.030> brought<00:02:59.450> roots

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
pattern it kind of brought roots

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.619 
pattern it kind of brought roots
slightly<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.280> see<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.819> kind<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.480> just

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
slightly you see that it kind of just

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.490 
slightly you see that it kind of just
sticks<00:03:02.959> out<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.200> little<00:03:03.349> bit<00:03:03.709> on<00:03:04.549> purpose<00:03:05.500> here

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
sticks out a little bit on purpose here

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.400 
sticks out a little bit on purpose here
I<00:03:06.739> do<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.910> think<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.180> goes<00:03:08.360> well<00:03:08.690> now<00:03:09.350> the

terrifying because this small flippers
are<00:03:14.329> very<00:03:14.750> question<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.350> there's<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:15.829> many

the<00:04:51.810> best<00:04:52.199> thing<00:04:52.380> for<00:04:52.770> me<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:52.949> do<00:04:53.250> just<00:04:53.610> nice

little<00:04:54.330> kind<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.840> answer<00:04:55.169> style<00:04:55.470> file<00:04:55.830> work

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100

little kind of answer style file work
there<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:57.270> gives<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.660> little<00:04:57.810> bit<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.110> look<00:04:58.380> I

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
there it gives it a little bit of look I

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.469 
there it gives it a little bit of look I
think<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.430> goes<00:04:59.610> with<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.910> theme<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
think it goes with the theme of the

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.029 
think it goes with the theme of the
handle<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.080> patterns<00:05:01.470> I've<00:05:01.590> been<00:05:01.770> doing
