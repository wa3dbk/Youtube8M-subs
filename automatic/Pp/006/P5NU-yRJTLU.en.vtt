this<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.820> my<00:00:03.000> demo<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.480> project<00:00:04.549> and<00:00:07.220> this

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
this is my demo my project and this

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.770 
this is my demo my project and this
thing<00:00:08.610> taped<00:00:08.940> onto<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.450> front<00:00:10.580> is<00:00:11.580> there<00:00:12.540> so

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
thing taped onto the front is there so

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.060 
thing taped onto the front is there so
that<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:13.080> show<00:00:13.549> it<00:00:14.660> working<00:00:15.800> so<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> can

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that I can show it working so that I can

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
that I can show it working so that I can
see<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> screen<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.850> my<00:00:17.880> camera<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
see the screen on my camera and have it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.429 
see the screen on my camera and have it
in<00:00:19.260> focus<00:00:19.939> it's<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.119> part<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> camcorder

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
in focus it's just part of a camcorder

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.980 
in focus it's just part of a camcorder
taped<00:00:23.100> onto<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.990> front<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> screen<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
taped onto the front of the screen and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.339 
taped onto the front of the screen and
it's<00:00:27.990> running<00:00:28.260> off<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:29.599> wired<00:00:30.599> power<00:00:30.960> source

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it's running off of a wired power source

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
it's running off of a wired power source
because<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> battery<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> dead<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.210> now

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
because the battery is dead right now

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:42.569 
because the battery is dead right now
but<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:35.040> works<00:00:39.410> when<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.530> started<00:00:40.890> up

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
but it works when I started up

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.180 
but it works when I started up
music<00:00:43.510> starts<00:00:43.780> playing<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.379> you<00:00:44.440> can<00:00:44.620> see

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
music starts playing and you can see

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.800 
music starts playing and you can see
there's<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.000> protagonist

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
there's the protagonist

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.380 
there's the protagonist
this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:49.680> first<00:00:49.920> software<00:00:50.670> demo<00:00:51.000> written

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this is the first software demo written

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.050 
this is the first software demo written
for<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> devil<00:00:51.960> night<00:00:52.310> it's<00:00:53.310> called<00:00:53.520> tiny

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
for the devil night it's called tiny

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.300 
for the devil night it's called tiny
minds<00:00:54.420> mom

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.079 

well<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:58.940> can<00:00:59.150> move<00:00:59.270> around

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.840 

there's<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.780> tree

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
there's a tree

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.780 
there's a tree
and<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.360> only<00:01:07.510> thing<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.840> little<00:01:07.990> guy<00:01:08.200> can<00:01:08.500> do

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and the only thing a little guy can do

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.220 
and the only thing a little guy can do
the<00:01:09.790> superpower<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.810> corruption

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
the superpower is corruption

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.770 
the superpower is corruption
so<00:01:13.620> if<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.860> walk<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> tree<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.910> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so if I walk up to the tree here and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.030 
so if I walk up to the tree here and
press<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.230> B<00:01:16.380> button<00:01:18.500> starts<00:01:19.500> corrupt<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
press the B button starts corrupt and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.630 
press the B button starts corrupt and
and<00:01:20.870> it<00:01:21.870> turns<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> well<00:01:23.640> any<00:01:24.060> block

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
and it turns into one of well any block

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.980 
and it turns into one of well any block
in<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.730> case<00:01:26.940> it's<00:01:27.180> turned<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.540> play

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
in this case it's turned into play

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
in this case it's turned into play
blocks<00:01:28.260> I<00:01:28.410> can<00:01:28.560> walk<00:01:28.650> through

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.120 

the<00:01:33.840> tree

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.350 

you

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.680 

so<00:01:47.930> here's<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.260> enemy<00:01:48.730> there's<00:01:49.730> one<00:01:49.820> only<00:01:50.390> one

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
so here's the enemy there's one only one

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.770 
so here's the enemy there's one only one
enemy<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.890> it's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
enemy so it's

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.550 
enemy so it's
the<00:01:53.140> enemy<00:01:53.640> capitalized

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.460 

he<00:01:58.100> just<00:01:58.280> tries<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.790> get<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.000> player<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.380> if

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
he just tries to get the player and if

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
he just tries to get the player and if
he<00:02:00.530> touches<00:02:00.740> me<00:02:00.860> you'll<00:02:01.159> die

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
he touches me you'll die

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.270 
he touches me you'll die
but

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.750 

I'm<00:02:06.790> careful

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.610 

I<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.540> corrupt<00:02:12.720> him<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:13.739> he<00:02:13.830> dies<00:02:14.150> but

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
I can corrupt him and then he dies but

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.170 
I can corrupt him and then he dies but
all<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> show<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> happens<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:18.030> don't

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
all the show it happens if you don't

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.950 
all the show it happens if you don't
curl

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:35.170 

so<00:02:25.320> if<00:02:25.410> i<00:02:25.500> go<00:02:25.530> back<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.100> place

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.650 

let's<00:02:36.180> let<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.480> enemy<00:02:36.749> kill<00:02:36.930> us

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
let's let the enemy kill us

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.430 
let's let the enemy kill us
and<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:41.490> ends<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.810> corruption

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and it just ends in a little corruption

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.420 
and it just ends in a little corruption
entire<00:02:44.340> game<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.760> done<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
entire game is done so that's the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.580 
entire game is done so that's the
gameplay<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:54.450> first<00:02:54.690> demo<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.050> return<00:02:55.410> for

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
gameplay of the first demo of return for

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.570 
gameplay of the first demo of return for
the<00:02:55.680> demo<00:02:55.830> life<00:02:57.710> if<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.800> want<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.070> sense<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.430> the

technical<00:02:59.940> challenge<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.660> went<00:03:00.810> into

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
technical challenge that went into

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.020

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.240 
the code you can see pictures of it
running<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:16.020> are<00:03:16.110> much<00:03:16.530> better<00:03:16.740> in<00:03:17.040> higher

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
running that are much better in higher
