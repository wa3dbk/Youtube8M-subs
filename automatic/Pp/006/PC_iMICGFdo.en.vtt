00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.010
 once 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.170
 what's going vicious here the viso gamer 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.969
 district a news that called me a lot 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.650
 Attention is something that has been 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.600
 hovering on the internet for a while but 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.740
 who decided to investigate further and is 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.690
 the possibility of playing with the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 protagonist and the antagonist of the game 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.470
 at the same time before I start I 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.240
 I ask you to like it if you want more 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 videos of this type so with nothing else 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 what to say we start this is something 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.880
 pretty interesting that it's something that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.619
 he claimed to give houser one of the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 creators of the game in an interview 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.489
 that they did a couple of years ago in 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 which said and I quote you can play with the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.840
 protagonist and the antagonist in the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 same story this is something very weird already 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 that in previous objects it was not like that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420
 as many get to do an anti-hero 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 but never an antagonist therefore 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.110
 we already have for sure that we 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.239
 we play as the protagonist and as the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 antagonist in the same story and by 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.559
 so the possibilities are reduced to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.780
 the three protagonists michael franklin 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 and shamrock and ask them now is which of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.649
 the three protagonists is the antagonist 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.329
 that the three were the antagonists not 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.829
 I would see it very logical besides that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.630
 rockstar said that at least one of 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.070
 they would be the bad for that reason for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.479
 discover who the antagonist is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 we will have to analyze each 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.870
 protagonist and reaction 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 I made during the story 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.620
 we'll start with franklin and this one 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 discarding antagonist because one 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.040
 brings a lot to the story because it seems 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.810
 just a guy looking to make money 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.700
 doing little jobs nothing new that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 although the end of the game franklin can 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 betray the clover or michael this 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.010
 we can discard that all 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.410
 we know that the true end of gta 5 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 is the end in which we can save 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.820
 michael and the clover and we ended up taking out 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 some loose ends so that's why 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.750
 discard let's go against this guy has 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.940
 more possibilities to be the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.039
 antagonist but honestly I am 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.330
 judging a lot by his attitude since he does not 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.399
 it is something that was worthy of a 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.680
 antagonist so trevor would be 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.330
 discarded and finally it would be michael 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 the latter which I think is the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.660
 antagonist of the game because I think this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 Well, we have to look at what I 've done 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.590
 a whole story first of all 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 betrayed Trevor and Brad during his 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.160
 time in nor so much even if it was for 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 saving his family is still a 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.180
 Treason to another protagonist of Gta 5 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.310
 then he was the one who started the story 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.140
 of gta 5 having destroyed one of the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.910
 properties of madrinzo kingfisher which 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.680
 made him go steal again and that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.720
 during a news about his stealing the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.580
 jewelry did not find out that it was 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 I live but if you think 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.940
 this guy does not do any action to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 heroic even if he wants to protect his 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.450
 family they do not seem to want 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.070
 for much of the story and that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.780
 is that he wants to protect the ends 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.520
 doing something worse or betraying 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.590
 someone close to him another reason 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.780
 why I think michael is the bad guy 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.150
 of gt5 is because if you set the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.680
 antagonists like devin game and stretch 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.660
 they are not very well developed and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.700
 exploited instead the history of 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
 the protagonists yes they are and if 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.210
 we combine this fact with what has been said 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.060
 previously we can conclude that 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.060
 michael is the true antagonist 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.970
 that was all I wish that in the 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.350
 comments tell me their theories for 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.600
 so to be able to interact more with and 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.310
 subscribers like it and their 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.110
 beliefs to be part of the vicious 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.110
 to keep watching and until next time 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.920
 Y 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.950
 yes 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.940
 yes
