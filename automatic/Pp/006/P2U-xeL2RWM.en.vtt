right when you start the game just

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.910 
because I didn't know what people have
that<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.409> didn't<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that you know I didn't want them to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.830 
that you know I didn't want them to
download<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.390> there<00:01:06.630> your

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
download it use it and then there your

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.170 
download it use it and then there your
ears<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.710> blown<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.760> volume<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
ears get blown out because my volume is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.010 
ears get blown out because my volume is
louder<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.570> theirs

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
louder than theirs

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.640 
louder than theirs
so<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.240> there's<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> variety<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.260> mean

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
so just I know there's a variety I mean

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
so just I know there's a variety I mean
the<00:01:13.920> way<00:01:14.070> people<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.700> their<00:01:14.880> volume<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the way people like their volume and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.179 
the way people like their volume and
things<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.740> left<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.979> all

and turn that up now just a few things I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
and turn that up now just a few things I
wanted<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> touch<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.320> helped<00:01:22.560> me

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
wanted to touch on that really helped me

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.280 
wanted to touch on that really helped me
out<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.159> was<00:01:24.090> finding<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> right

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
out a lot was finding the right

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.039 
out a lot was finding the right
sensitivity<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.460> being<00:01:27.090> able<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> snap<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
sensitivity of being able to snap to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
sensitivity of being able to snap to
places<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.799> finding<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.490> lower

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
places you know finding a lower

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.390 
places you know finding a lower
sensitivity<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.140> helped<00:01:31.650> help<00:01:32.310> me

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
sensitivity so it really helped help me

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.730 
sensitivity so it really helped help me
out<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> lot<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.299> aiming<00:01:33.930> things<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
out a lot with aiming things like that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.280 
out a lot with aiming things like that
some<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.610> things<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.060> found<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
some more things that I found out was

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.460 
some more things that I found out was
which<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.159> dominant<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.180> am<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.930> usually<00:01:40.320> works

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
which I dominant I am this usually works

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.929 
which I dominant I am this usually works
with<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.770> shooting<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.130> gun<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> also<00:01:41.610> does

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
with like shooting a gun it also does

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.859 
with like shooting a gun it also does
work<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.329> csgo<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:43.439> you're<00:01:44.340> mainly<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
work on csgo because you're mainly like

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
work on csgo because you're mainly like
depending<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.490> dominant<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
depending on what I you are dominant in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.899 
depending on what I you are dominant in
you<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.750> looking<00:01:49.170> towards<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.950> place<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you are looking towards that place the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
you are looking towards that place the
most<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.619> guys<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.979> search<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.430> video

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
most now you guys can search up a video

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.969 
most now you guys can search up a video
of<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> exactly<00:01:54.590> but<00:01:55.590> pretty<00:01:55.619> much

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
of how to do it exactly but pretty much

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
of how to do it exactly but pretty much
what<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> make<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> circle<00:01:57.420> with

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
what you do is you make a circle with

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
what you do is you make a circle with
your<00:01:57.630> hand<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.020> front<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.259> your<00:01:58.469> face<00:01:58.649> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
your hand in front of your face and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.550 
your hand in front of your face and
bring<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> closer<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.570> face<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.110> then

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
bring it closer to your face and then

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.230 
bring it closer to your face and then
you<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.159> look<00:02:02.310> out<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.549> left<00:02:02.759> eye<00:02:03.000> if

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you if you look out of your left eye if

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.200 
you if you look out of your left eye if
it's<00:02:03.689> closer<00:02:04.079> than<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.399> from<00:02:05.820> when<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it's closer than it is from when you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.819 
it's closer than it is from when you
close<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:06.899> left<00:02:07.140> eye<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> look<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> your

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
close your left eye and look out of your

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.800 
close your left eye and look out of your
right<00:02:08.069> eye<00:02:08.179> then<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.209> are<00:02:09.569> left<00:02:09.750> eye<00:02:09.929> dominant

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
right eye then you are left eye dominant

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.470 
right eye then you are left eye dominant
and<00:02:10.929> vice-versa<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.370> if<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:12.910> closer<00:02:13.180> when

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and vice-versa so if it's closer when

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.270 
and vice-versa so if it's closer when
you<00:02:13.569> look<00:02:13.720> out<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.900> your<00:02:14.080> right<00:02:14.230> eye<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.739> it's

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you look out of your right eye and it's

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.070 
you look out of your right eye and it's
farther<00:02:15.550> away<00:02:15.700> when<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.120> look<00:02:16.300> at<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.569> your

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
farther away when you look at it your

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.470 
farther away when you look at it your
left<00:02:17.260> eye<00:02:17.500> then<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.310> are<00:02:18.670> right<00:02:18.849> I<00:02:18.910> dominate

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
left eye then you are right I dominate

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.030 
left eye then you are right I dominate
another<00:02:19.989> thing<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.410> helped<00:02:20.680> me<00:02:20.739> was

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
another thing that helped me was

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.830 
another thing that helped me was
actually<00:02:21.280> changing<00:02:21.970> my<00:02:22.090> gun<00:02:22.330> over<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
actually changing my gun over to the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.140 
actually changing my gun over to the
left<00:02:23.110> hand<00:02:23.319> side<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.550> see<00:02:24.910> is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
left hand side so all I really see is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.690 
left hand side so all I really see is
the<00:02:25.330> reticle<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.989> where<00:02:26.950> I'm<00:02:27.099> shooting<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
the reticle and where I'm shooting I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.580 
the reticle and where I'm shooting I
don't<00:02:27.910> necessarily<00:02:28.180> pay<00:02:28.660> attention<00:02:29.200> or<00:02:29.380> as

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
don't necessarily pay attention or as

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.870 
don't necessarily pay attention or as
much<00:02:29.890> attention<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.849> my<00:02:31.180> gun<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.670> time

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
much attention to my gun all the time

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.610 
much attention to my gun all the time
like<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.330> used<00:02:34.569> to<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.900> know<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.140> gun<00:02:35.290> for<00:02:35.530> me

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
like I used to you know the gun for me

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.350 
like I used to you know the gun for me
used<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.980> really<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.640> way<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> lot<00:02:37.060> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
used to really get in the way a lot and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.910 
used to really get in the way a lot and
so<00:02:37.599> that's<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.989> thing<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.410> figured<00:02:38.830> out

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
so that's one thing that I figured out

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.210 
so that's one thing that I figured out
that<00:02:38.980> definitely<00:02:39.580> helped<00:02:39.970> now<00:02:41.069> with<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that definitely helped now with the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820 
that definitely helped now with the
configuration<00:02:42.519> there's<00:02:43.510> different<00:02:44.410> graphics

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
configuration there's different graphics

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.199 
configuration there's different graphics
settings<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.340> things<00:02:45.549> like<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
settings and things like that and

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.240 
settings and things like that and
different<00:02:46.750> resolution<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.440> stuff<00:02:47.650> like<00:02:47.799> that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
different resolution and stuff like that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.039 
different resolution and stuff like that
you<00:02:49.150> guys<00:02:49.269> can<00:02:49.480> definitely<00:02:49.569> change<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
you guys can definitely change the

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.320 
you guys can definitely change the
resolution<00:02:50.769> but<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.190> way<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> graphics<00:02:52.180> are

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
resolution but the way the graphics are

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.170 
resolution but the way the graphics are
and<00:02:52.480> everything<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and everything in what I have like the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.140 
and everything in what I have like the
video<00:02:55.450> stuff<00:02:55.840> set<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.349> is<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.489> fully

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
video stuff set to is just to fully

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.170 
video stuff set to is just to fully
optimize<00:02:59.040> 110<00:03:00.040> percent<00:03:00.280> optimize<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.940> game's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
optimize 110 percent optimize the game's

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.330 
optimize 110 percent optimize the game's
performance<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.349> it'll<00:03:02.560> run<00:03:02.769> faster

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
performance and so it'll run faster

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.009 
performance and so it'll run faster
you'll<00:03:03.489> get<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> higher<00:03:03.819> FPS<00:03:04.060> things<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:04.840> that

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
you'll get a higher FPS things like that

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.589 
you'll get a higher FPS things like that
so<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.470> also<00:03:06.010> helped<00:03:06.670> out<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.819> lot<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.450> you

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
so that also helped out a lot and you

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.600 
so that also helped out a lot and you
know<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.049> really<00:03:08.170> practicing<00:03:08.920> aiming

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
know just really practicing aiming

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.610 
know just really practicing aiming
things<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.299> that<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.930> getting<00:03:11.410> used

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
things like that you know getting used

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.880 
things like that you know getting used
to<00:03:11.739> my<00:03:11.890> sensitivity<00:03:13.260> playing<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:14.470> maybe

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
to my sensitivity playing with maybe

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.099 
to my sensitivity playing with maybe
like<00:03:15.130> changing<00:03:15.459> around<00:03:15.549> some<00:03:15.940> my<00:03:16.269> controls

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
like changing around some my controls

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.960 
like changing around some my controls
and<00:03:17.380> stuff<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.950> with<00:03:18.310> my<00:03:18.430> keyboard<00:03:18.880> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
and stuff like that with my keyboard and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.210 
and stuff like that with my keyboard and
everything<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> huge<00:03:20.590> thing<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.010> did

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
everything just the huge thing that did

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.550 
everything just the huge thing that did
help<00:03:21.370> out<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.640> lot<00:03:21.880> was<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.390> playing<00:03:22.780> more

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
help out a lot was just playing more

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.680 
help out a lot was just playing more
often<00:03:24.010> because<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.640> didn't<00:03:24.880> play<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.239> much<00:03:25.269> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
often because I didn't play as much and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.120 
often because I didn't play as much and
then<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.810> started<00:03:26.170> playing<00:03:26.319> more<00:03:26.590> often<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
then I started playing more often I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.400 
then I started playing more often I
started<00:03:27.549> practicing<00:03:28.450> my<00:03:28.600> aim<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.810> started
