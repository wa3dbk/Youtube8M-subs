 he put on fear computer next star 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.060
 making 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.770
 inserting the comment you deleted would have required 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.480
 name 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.440
 and you put here 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.520
 and for example 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 for example 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.650
 checking account 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 Let's put it here that is without real 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.700
 savings 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.660
 equal 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.200
 to 300 reais 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.110
 just for you sign your comment 7 can adjust attaching to running 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.820
 Mouse 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 t-shirt lectures you can 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 adjust column width 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.890
 you put the course on that russian landmark position you can 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.280
 move to where you want to leave this comment 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.310
 for example if it made different in that distance and tourist candê 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.070
 has shown here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 also showing my origin 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 of mine should start or the starting balance 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.560
 click and somehow note how old it disappeared 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.450
 but that with red signal here that when it was done it went on crisis 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.860
 Sinochem red and presents on the screen 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.210
 what's written 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.560
 there in that comment 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.969
 if you wanted 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.790
 That this review came out in print you would have to 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.669
 displayed 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.549
 in the display menu 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.339
 has option here comments 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.939
 to him to stay all the time exhibiting 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.419
 so here it would go in print 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.169
 now let's define a print area 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.570
 how do you define yourself faster than you have 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.649
 arakaki fu 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.599
 the print area set 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.460
 he asks do you know if a single cell 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.509
 You have to select more 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.579
 let's wait for the review it's doing there 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.639
 the review is that we're going to have to mark everything we want 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.539
 print even with the form my turn and cargil value of inflation 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.459
 see only now has the sea 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.569
 a demarcated area 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 Where will our printing area be? 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.879
 this was my 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.979
 and so it is defined 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.289
 our printing area 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.289
 tension 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:22.299
 now you can view access to print file view area 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.039
 the image has been cropped because it is broken on two pages 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.769
 if you press 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.089
 the request is a sweet keyboard if you will see the second page 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:38.139
 is now that it offers some features of order of organization of the 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:38.859
 Image 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.869
 for example small button set up 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.519
 and change 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.269
 to appear on paper 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.539
 your work for example instead of being in the portrait format that this total 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:56.179
 put in the port not in the photo the landscape position that is lying down and gave 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.519
 ok 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.549
 waiting instant 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.660
 organized this way 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.810
 only see that it will leave January until September is missing - or cough 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.199
 other months you are 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.319
 on the second page 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.530
 I want to see you can with the scroll bar 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.900
 will see the rest the rest here too 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.160
 or competition 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.370
 it's another option 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.309
 even you 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:26.159
 to be able to contemplate on a single page the whole impression of your 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.979
 job 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.259
 vote in the configure menu 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.869
 and here is a very simple option to adjust for a click here 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.110
 and death 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.870
 see in that moment until under each page a podium 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.539
 is a one-page all your work will be printed in just one 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:44.620
 page 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.480
 I note that to print on a single page the size of the letter must be the 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.300
 acceptable minimum 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.220
 can not be too small that if no one manages to be able to read his 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.090
 job 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.650
 if you have supplies and if you notice printing is missing some 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.790
 characters or signs other outlines 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.129
 our work only applies with 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.870
 this looping and about 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.719
 work and wind 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.729
 and then you check the name of the actual shape that will appear 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.620
 sign of correct formatting handling has been preserved 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.659
 clicking again decreases 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.870
 and gives an impression and is not complete but in reality 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.159
 when playing 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.909
 the bigger the letter you see you have all the values ​​friend 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.530
 Very well. 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.970
 you learned a quick way to mark the area 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.970
 we will repeat the process 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.449
 come on 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.620
 4 for 500 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.660
 first thing to mark the area that will be printed 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.020
 then I can handle it 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.270
 the refund set and thus your list set 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.680
 yea 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.969
 after viewing print 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.330
 happens right? 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.740
 of your work is not fitting on a single page as it is in that case 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.369
 because it assumed because beforehand I had already formatted so 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.839
 and by chance they had a portrait 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.119
 would force it to fit inside a page more vertically and is a job done 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:20.659
 so little 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.509
 Why is the command here? 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:24.819
 set to 1 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:25.810
 if you 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.819
 they left free here 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.080
 wine from 100% 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.849
 for example the original letter size 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.050
 give an ok 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.039
 it will break the page as it happened the other time 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.919
 I noticed 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.840
 basically I usually do the following putting scenery and put fit 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.789
 to huck 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:46.919
 do the test 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.099
 if you are in reasonable size wonder my impression is 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.279
 ready to print and first button just click here 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.050
 and he will shoot 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.830
 on your printer 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.080
 that's right 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.150
 after this encounter will be tightened the printer's own lower price 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:05.649
 what 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:08.859
 ask whether you want to go ahead or not print 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:10.849
 the goal 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:12.260
 before such a line 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.389
 It was just to show you how easy it is. 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.469
 to print a page in excel 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.610
 P 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.759
 and so 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.669
 I think it's enough 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:24.869
 diaper of today 

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.129
 if you look at the years resources that in the teaching but in previous years are 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:31.029
 click here 

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:34.029
 the job will stay at a smaller size 

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:39.299
 and this will reflect and percutindo the expression let's put the view 

00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:40.050
 Look 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.529
 he stayed 

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:47.479
 or respect the adjustments you are making, let's see here 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:50.110
 click them 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.309
 save a little 

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:56.719
 note it was only in the print 

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:58.349
 it's you 

00:07:58.349 --> 00:07:59.229
 put on 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.439
 here is what will print spain 

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:05.679
 the lieutenant for what you really want to print 

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:08.349
 those of the controls are not 

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:10.649
 to decrease or increase the area 

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:11.929
 Printing 

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:12.919
 the ocde 

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:14.580
