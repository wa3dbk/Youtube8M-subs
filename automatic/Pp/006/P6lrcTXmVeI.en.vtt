 hello welcome john deere 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.459
 name 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.959
 today we are at the factory in 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.700
 american city springfield 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.800
 where the engines are restored and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.660
 components besides here in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 Springfield is the center where 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.860
 Rome comes in from all over the world 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 let's start our tour from the site 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.600
 disassembly after tricks verification rome fund 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.730
 enters the disassembly site here knots 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.340
 carefully understand to exclude 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 even minor damage 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 workable parts 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.470
 complete disassembly allows you to reach 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 high level of cleaning parts and 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.630
 improve the quality of their follow 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.210
 troubleshooting defective parts recycled 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.180
 and all of our other part such as 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 pistons and cylinders bearings and seals 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 change without exception for cleaning off 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 residues of oils and plaque 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.360
 mechanically machined parts such 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.460
 both rods and shafts 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.829
 wash chemical solutions under 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.049
 high pressure small parts 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.330
 cleaned in-line car washes in the block 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.840
 cylinder and block heads and cast iron 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.180
 the details 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.659
 fired in paint removal ovens and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.880
 scum after cleaning all parts 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.140
 checked for compliance 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 geometric specifications and on 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 no magnet cracking optical 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 media process 1 chapter 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 used to check all blocks and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.210
 heads of distribution blocks and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.060
 crankshafts as well as these rods 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 magnetizable parts are covered 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 phosphorescent solution and checked 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.090
 according to the ultraviolet lamp colors on 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.100
 no hidden things without such 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.880
 crack checks may remain not 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.799
 discovered 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.799
 and cause serious node failure 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.290
 all engine components including 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.899
 water and oil pumps and pushers and 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.299
 rockers are restored to the newest 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.460
 john deere specifications and shipped 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.570
 on the engine assembly line exactly to 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.570
 the required time 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.750
 resilience recovery process 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.240
 guarantees steady quality

 engine assembly technology john deere 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.250
 names are different here assembly technology 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.260
 new engine john deere our mechanics 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.840
 experts in the field of assembly and betrayed 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.540
 money quality on two assembly lines 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.510
 Whether the mechanics of engines collect shores 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.180
 principle from beginning to end controlling 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.680
 quality of each other's work after assembly 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.560
 engines coming to the site 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:51.390
 turbine installation and fuel equipment 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:54.440
 and filters after assembly all without 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.880
 engine exclusion blocks and testing 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.520
 complete engines install 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.640
 on dynamometer stands fill 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.770
 oil at the fuel and turns on the workers 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.530
 speeds check the pressure and 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.590
 oil circulation is compressed into the cylinder and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.080
 other operating parameters for blocks 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.989
 cylinder assembly check pressure in 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.560
 cylinders and build quality after 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.860
 checks 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.030
 all engines are flushed clean and 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.030
 prepared to paint 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.650
 coloring packaging is the latest 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.810
 stage before sending the component 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.010
 as we service cars throughout 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.340
 enterprise john deere 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.510
 several different paint colors are required 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.420
 serviced surfaces close 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.400
 so that the paint does not fall into these areas 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.380
 the paint dries quickly and then the component 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.940
 placed in a shipping box or 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.500
 shipping packing stand 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.600
 provides reliable delivery 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.190
 components to dealers and may 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.700
 used to return them to fund 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.700
 care of them 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.800
 disassembly and cleaning of fuel pumps and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.420
 nozzles occurs in a separate area 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.090
 all pumps and injectors are completely 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.010
 disassembled exterior parts are exposed 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.120
 sandblast processing for soda 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.310
 paint cleaning 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.400
 and the internal parts are chemically purified 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.490
 bath using ultrasound after 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.730
 cleaning all defective wear parts 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.950
 change to new fuel assembly 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.200
 pumps and injectors produced in 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.440
 separate from the site disassembly and cleaning and 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.810
 workshop with climate control 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.650
 all pump and injectors are tested on 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.500
 modern test benches in front 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.510
 the pump packaging is painted and the nozzles 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.510
 bilberry for corrosion protection
