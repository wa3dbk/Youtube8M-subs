00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it was a little bit hard to play on the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
it was a little bit hard to play on the
pitch<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.370> wasn't<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.699> wasn't<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> best

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
condition but I felt like we tried to to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.360 
condition but I felt like we tried to to
keep<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> down<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.649> times<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.219> did

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
keep it down and but at times we did

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
keep it down and but at times we did
really<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.940> keep<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> ball<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
really well to keep the ball and and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.609 
really well to keep the ball and and
work<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> work<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> wide<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.290> get<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.439> good

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.630 
work the work it wide and get some good
chances<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> yeah<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> felt<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.920> felt<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.549> we

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
chances but yeah I felt I felt like we

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.149 
chances but yeah I felt I felt like we
just<00:01:11.760> needed<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> bit<00:01:12.390> more<00:01:12.720> quality<00:01:13.159> which

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
just needed that bit more quality which

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.700 
just needed that bit more quality which
we've<00:01:14.340> been<00:01:14.460> lacking<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.470> in<00:01:16.470> some

we've been lacking a little bit in some
of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> games<00:01:18.799> just<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> put<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.189> final

bottle it to put that final shot away or
that<00:01:24.210> final<00:01:24.540> pass<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.320> clear<00:01:25.710> goal

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that final pass to get a clear goal

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.789 
that final pass to get a clear goal
opportunity<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.960> were<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.170> beaten<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.619> four

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
feeling I'm feeling better and better I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.830 
feeling I'm feeling better and better I
say<00:02:07.129> had<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.759> muscle<00:02:09.119> injuries<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.629> bit

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
say had it with muscle injuries a bit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
say had it with muscle injuries a bit
it's<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.500> hard<00:02:10.709> because

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's a bit hard because

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's a bit hard because
it's<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.510> tough<00:02:13.540> one<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.080> know<00:02:14.530> exactly<00:02:14.680> when

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's a tough one to know exactly when

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.650 
it's a tough one to know exactly when
you're<00:02:15.400> when<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.820> one<00:02:15.910> hundred<00:02:16.000> percent<00:02:16.210> and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
you're when you one hundred percent and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.760 
you're when you one hundred percent and
when<00:02:16.750> you're<00:02:16.900> when<00:02:17.050> you're<00:02:17.170> all<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.470> way<00:02:17.590> back

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
when you're when you're all the way back

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.590 
when you're when you're all the way back
but<00:02:18.010> I've<00:02:18.280> been<00:02:18.520> feeling<00:02:18.700> quite<00:02:18.940> good<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
but I've been feeling quite good in the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.080 
but I've been feeling quite good in the
games<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.020> play<00:02:20.200> now<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.730> still<00:02:21.730> think

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
games that I play now and still think

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.180 
games that I play now and still think
that<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.420> might<00:02:22.690> have<00:02:22.930> probably<00:02:23.650> fire<00:02:23.980> ten

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that I might have probably fire ten

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.740 
that I might have probably fire ten
percent<00:02:24.580> them<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.850> them<00:02:25.000> back<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.510> where<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.720> was

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
percent them to them back to where I was

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.140 
percent them to them back to where I was
before<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.350> got<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.620> injury<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.150> hopefully

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
before I got the injury but hopefully

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.660 
before I got the injury but hopefully
I'll<00:02:28.300> I'll<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> few<00:02:29.680> games<00:02:29.860> now<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.520> then

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670

Sunderland<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.290> way<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:45.220> went<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.550> there

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
Sunderland the way we we went up there

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.960 
Sunderland the way we we went up there
and<00:02:46.030> did<00:02:46.270> really<00:02:46.480> well<00:02:46.540> against<00:02:47.020> them<00:02:47.140> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and did really well against them and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.370 
and did really well against them and
again<00:02:48.970> should<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.360> maybe<00:02:49.540> come<00:02:50.110> away<00:02:50.350> with

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
again should have maybe come away with

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.160 
again should have maybe come away with
the<00:02:50.620> win<00:02:51.450> another<00:02:52.450> day<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.840> might<00:02:52.989> have

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
the win another day we might have

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.260 
the win another day we might have
might've<00:02:53.890> scored<00:02:54.130> it's<00:02:54.790> got<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.030> go<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
might've scored it's got to go and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.449 
might've scored it's got to go and
nicked<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:55.810> yeah<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:56.800> think<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.280> we

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
nicked it but yeah I think that we

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.130 
nicked it but yeah I think that we
should<00:02:57.670> go<00:02:57.940> into<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.239> game<00:02:58.480> feeling<00:02:58.989> really

the<00:03:30.850> decoct<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.730> almost<00:03:33.970> bound<00:03:34.209> to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
the decoct I it is it's almost bound to

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.420 
the decoct I it is it's almost bound to
open<00:03:34.600> up<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.780> bit<00:03:34.959> like<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.799> last<00:03:35.980> one<00:03:36.070> didn't

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
open up a bit like the last one didn't

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.420 
open up a bit like the last one didn't
in<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.730> second<00:03:37.090> half<00:03:37.269> as<00:03:37.390> well<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:38.340> when<00:03:39.340> it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
in the second half as well and when it

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.340 
in the second half as well and when it
does<00:03:39.580> I'm<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.570> hoping<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.080> got<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
does I'm just hoping that we got the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.890 
does I'm just hoping that we got the
quality<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.790> can<00:03:43.390> get<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.660> cold

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
quality and and can get that cold

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.990 
quality and and can get that cold
suggestion<00:03:44.380> it's<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.310> over<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.580> year<00:03:45.640> ago<00:03:45.790> now

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
suggestion it's just over a year ago now
