00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Of course, this week sees everything 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.410
 The Hunger Games 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello we together the film factory now 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.980
 it's time again for a speed date 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.750
 And this week is starting a big one 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.730
 watch a movie where he is in the ranking 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.350
 placed and I'll show you now 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.609
 again the new restarts of the week in 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.680
 120 seconds 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 in the reverse ranking of the worst 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 until the best movie in third place 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.900
 I have a movie of which I am full of pride 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.670
 can say is the worst movies 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 that I have seen in my life 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.230
 no good deed is actually the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 film program so the film title of the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 Program it terrible when your enemies 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.200
 Does she really have her one and a half? 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.550
 hours and do not want to hurt you 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 Achsen but just buy one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.239
 movie ticket for this movie showing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 namely as one would to in no 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.989
 If it continues to turn it should me 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.090
 really so from the rearmost drawing board from 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.090
 the very last writers kitchen 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 Hollywood would be a fatal mistake 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.910
 has seen the construction that is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.410
 really the cheapest puzzle of the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 boring frame and no matter what I 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.309
 say the film is not even good 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 played and completely without exciting 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.270
 that's why at place three that suggests 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 he could bronze plaster plate would be nothing 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.049
 We win higher in second place 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 Violence is really about quality 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.520
 miles away is a movie 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.020
 sweden and is actually very 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 interesting because the question open as 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.869
 would you actually act yourself and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 this is about him being a family 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.920
 in a case of an avalanche accident 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.689
 it could come alive though 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.490
 nothing just fled the part 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.369
 and left the family in the lurch 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.140
 and of course that is first in the first one 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.490
 even matter because yay tors but survives 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 However, one already stands by it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 ask what is really if 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 what can I count on you 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.040
 interesting relationship drama in place 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.880
 two also have cannes on the case 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 won prizes 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 should definitely be athos fans 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.979
 arrive on square one but I the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.390
 actually not super strong cases 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.950
 but he wants beside higher violence 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 would actually be made by 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.390
 palermo king jay and i was already one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 bit disappointed because you have this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 exciting basic orientation you in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.299
 actually had the movie and also 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.979
 stories plot this plot the direction 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.600
 Unfortunately one could not tell 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.250
 the potential is fully exhausted and so on 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.869
 is the film at some places 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.729
 incredibly boring for we got 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.830
 good actors like julianne moore die 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660
 he the finder 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.100
 we bring forward and the hook 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.190
 Overall then well worth seeing 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.660
 but make in comparison to the others 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 this is definitely the one for both 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.080
 weakest part but still on 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.880
 Place one this week who is now 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.080
 always want to see the view and 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.170
 I think that was very nice to me 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.060
 differentiated you are presented here 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 below the tribute of panem ok gebhard 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.140
 One more wants to see the higher violence 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.400
 gives siri video below right I have to 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.470
 I'm not in the chair right here 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 initiated review below right then 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.160
 we like to see each other again bayer 19 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.580
 criticism of the film factory with me the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.580
 doping
