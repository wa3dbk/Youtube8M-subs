00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:26.629
 click the export file renderer here I 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:31.370

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:36.549
 so here everyone is checking sa and let's 123 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:40.400
 then everything is okay , we are waiting 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:44.150
 there must be something here so 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:49.849
 then open the file and the budget opened 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:53.919

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:07.370
 coefficient 900 is a shorter ratio 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.419
 900 do everything everything will be fine and 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.009
 so see our world mycraft import 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.620

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.549

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.729
 here or 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.110
 we need to be friends 5 textures so choose 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:28.340
 any material and here then select all 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.180
 materials and yes so selected all materials 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:37.270

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.270
 we are here from these 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:47.030

 whether the texture turned out and you see how 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.590
