you did this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.100 
you did this
how<00:02:14.670> did<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.030> come<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.300> be<00:02:15.420> how<00:02:15.660> did<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.900> say

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
how did that come to be how did you say

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.050 
how did that come to be how did you say
you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.410> what<00:02:16.590> let's<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.640> well<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you know what let's just do this well I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.720 
you know what let's just do this well I
just<00:02:18.300> knew<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.200> many<00:02:19.500> people<00:02:19.680> were<00:02:20.489> in

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
just knew that so many people were in

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.759 
just knew that so many people were in
the<00:02:20.910> dark<00:02:21.180> when<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.750> came<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.110> colonoscopies

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
the dark when it came to colonoscopies

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.440 
the dark when it came to colonoscopies
they<00:02:22.920> had<00:02:23.010> never<00:02:23.220> heard<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.970> colonoscopy

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
they had never heard of a colonoscopy

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.449 
they had never heard of a colonoscopy
they<00:02:24.959> didn't<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.379> know<00:02:25.650> what<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.950> entailed

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
they didn't really know what it entailed

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.610 
they didn't really know what it entailed
and<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.180> thought<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.660> could<00:02:27.720> remove<00:02:28.290> some<00:02:28.590> of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
and I thought if I could remove some of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.920 
and I thought if I could remove some of
the<00:02:28.769> stigma<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.519> show<00:02:30.030> people<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.569> procedure

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the stigma and show people the procedure

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.009 
the stigma and show people the procedure
is<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.650> quite<00:02:31.950> easy<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.640> it's<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.810> lot

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
is really quite easy and it's it's a lot

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.259 
is really quite easy and it's it's a lot
easier<00:02:34.260> than<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.950> diagnosis<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.880> colon<00:02:36.060> cancer

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
easier than a diagnosis of colon cancer

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.600 
easier than a diagnosis of colon cancer
and<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.900> wanted<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> explain<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.830> women<00:02:38.160> they're

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
and I wanted to explain to women they're

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.300 
and I wanted to explain to women they're
diagnosed<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.390> often<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.900> men<00:02:40.160> Hispanics<00:02:41.160> as

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
diagnosed is often as men Hispanics as

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.699 
diagnosed is often as men Hispanics as
we<00:02:41.459> saw<00:02:41.640> Jimmy<00:02:42.090> Smith's<00:02:42.450> are<00:02:43.049> often<00:02:43.500> diagnosed

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
we saw Jimmy Smith's are often diagnosed

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.390 
we saw Jimmy Smith's are often diagnosed
in<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.090> advanced<00:02:45.569> stages<00:02:46.400> african-americans

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
in the advanced stages african-americans

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.339 
in the advanced stages african-americans
have<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> higher<00:02:47.910> mortality<00:02:48.209> rate<00:02:48.810> there's<00:02:49.049> so

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
have a higher mortality rate there's so

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.680 
have a higher mortality rate there's so
much<00:02:49.530> misinformation<00:02:50.160> really<00:02:51.090> quite<00:02:51.330> frankly

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
much misinformation really quite frankly

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.900 
much misinformation really quite frankly
ignorance<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.920> there<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.549> I<00:02:53.579> thought<00:02:53.880> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
ignorance out there that I thought I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.210 
ignorance out there that I thought I
could<00:02:54.299> really<00:02:54.569> shed<00:02:54.840> some<00:02:55.110> light<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.799> stigma

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
could really shed some light the stigma

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.059 
could really shed some light the stigma
thing<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.640> still<00:02:56.940> there<00:02:57.239> because<00:02:57.630> even<00:02:58.380> as<00:02:58.650> I

people die every single year and it's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.319 
people die every single year and it's
not<00:03:25.709> just<00:03:25.980> an<00:03:26.100> old<00:03:26.280> man's<00:03:26.519> disease<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.090> can't

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
not just an old man's disease I can't

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.270 
not just an old man's disease I can't
emphasize<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.810> enough<00:03:28.049> because<00:03:28.560> many<00:03:28.799> women

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
emphasize that enough because many women

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.220 
emphasize that enough because many women
think<00:03:29.790> oh<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.269> disease<00:03:30.569> that's<00:03:30.600> will

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
think oh that's a disease that's will

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.379 
think oh that's a disease that's will
only<00:03:31.410> affect<00:03:31.590> older<00:03:32.190> men<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.030> everyone

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
only affect older men right but everyone

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.690 
only affect older men right but everyone
almost<00:03:33.780> everyone<00:03:34.079> has<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> colon<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.130> everyone

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
almost everyone has a colon and everyone

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.330 
almost everyone has a colon and everyone
is<00:03:35.850> vulnerable<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.780> thing<00:03:37.019> is<00:03:37.049> also<00:03:37.799> early

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
is vulnerable the thing is also early

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.640 
is vulnerable the thing is also early
detection<00:03:38.519> like<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.420> many<00:03:39.750> other<00:03:39.989> cancers<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
detection like so many other cancers and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.340 
detection like so many other cancers and
especially<00:03:41.310> especially<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.660> colon<00:03:43.019> cancer

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
especially especially the colon cancer

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.319 
especially especially the colon cancer
because<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.769> almost<00:03:43.920> like<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.519> colon<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.150> its

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
because it's almost like a colon is its

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.720 
because it's almost like a colon is its
own<00:03:45.480> container<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.470> can<00:03:46.680> remove<00:03:47.069> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
own container and if you can remove the

own container and if you can remove the
polyp<00:03:48.000> or<00:03:49.160> even<00:03:50.160> before<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.670> cancerous<00:03:51.150> then

polyp or even before it's cancerous then

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.140 
polyp or even before it's cancerous then
you<00:03:52.049> literally<00:03:52.440> nip<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.130> disease<00:03:53.489> in<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.940> bud

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
you literally nip the disease in the bud

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.670 
you literally nip the disease in the bud
and<00:03:54.389> that's<00:03:54.569> why<00:03:54.780> getting<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.319> screening

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
and that's why getting a screening

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.530 
and that's why getting a screening
colonoscopy<00:03:55.799> when<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.700> feel<00:03:57.030> well<00:03:57.299> and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
colonoscopy when you feel well and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.500 
colonoscopy when you feel well and
you're<00:03:57.989> completely<00:03:58.440> asymptomatic<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.880> so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
you're completely asymptomatic is so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.229 
you're completely asymptomatic is so
