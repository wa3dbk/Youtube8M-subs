taking<00:04:56.930> up<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.110> whole<00:04:57.140> back<00:04:57.500> down<00:04:58.070> but<00:04:58.190> it

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
taking up the whole back down but it

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.710 
taking up the whole back down but it
does<00:04:58.460> collapse<00:04:58.760> as<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.120> can<00:04:59.240> see<00:04:59.390> quite<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.630> bit

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
does collapse as you can see quite a bit

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.870 
does collapse as you can see quite a bit
I<00:05:00.020> mean<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.740> can<00:05:00.890> put<00:05:01.100> this<00:05:01.250> forward<00:05:01.550> if<00:05:01.790> you

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
I mean you can put this forward if you

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.770 
I mean you can put this forward if you
like<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.510> can<00:05:02.570> leave<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:03.020> back<00:05:03.169> like<00:05:03.350> that<00:05:04.780> but

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
like you can leave it back like that but

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.850 
like you can leave it back like that but
there<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:05.960> go<00:05:05.990> there's<00:05:06.229> it<00:05:06.320> back<00:05:06.470> back<00:05:06.680> and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
there you go there's it back back and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.790 
there you go there's it back back and
there<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.520> have<00:05:08.950> herp<00:05:09.950> here<00:05:10.220> in<00:05:10.310> robot<00:05:10.669> mode

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.140 

just<00:05:15.800> like<00:05:15.919> that<00:05:17.229> his<00:05:18.340> legs<00:05:19.340> have<00:05:19.640> actually<00:05:20.120> a

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
just like that his legs have actually a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.880 
just like that his legs have actually a
pretty<00:05:20.330> good<00:05:20.479> articulation<00:05:21.169> for<00:05:21.410> having<00:05:21.740> the

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
pretty good articulation for having the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.330 
pretty good articulation for having the
doors<00:05:22.340> on<00:05:22.640> them<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.540> bend<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.870> knees<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
doors on them the bend of the knees the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.760 
doors on them the bend of the knees the
rotate<00:05:25.760> at<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.090> ball<00:05:26.930> joints<00:05:27.200> on<00:05:27.320> his<00:05:27.440> ankles

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
rotate at the ball joints on his ankles

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.670 
rotate at the ball joints on his ankles
on<00:05:28.370> this<00:05:28.640> arm<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.150> can<00:05:29.720> rotate<00:05:30.169> up<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:30.530> down

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
on this arm I can rotate up and down

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.600 
on this arm I can rotate up and down
forward<00:05:31.419> rotate<00:05:32.419> at<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.600> wrist<00:05:33.460> bends<00:05:34.460> at<00:05:34.580> the

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
forward rotate at the wrist bends at the

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.969 
forward rotate at the wrist bends at the
elbow<00:05:34.700> or<00:05:35.390> rotates<00:05:35.780> above<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.169> their<00:05:36.380> bicep

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
elbow or rotates above that their bicep

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.280 
elbow or rotates above that their bicep
I<00:05:37.250> mean<00:05:37.729> is<00:05:37.850> but<00:05:38.150> his<00:05:38.240> wrist<00:05:38.450> does<00:05:38.660> rotate<00:05:39.080> so

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
I mean is but his wrist does rotate so

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.420 
I mean is but his wrist does rotate so
for<00:05:39.470> those<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.770> were<00:05:39.950> worrying<00:05:40.310> that

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
for those of you were worrying that

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.680 
for those of you were worrying that
maybe<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.700> could<00:05:40.850> do<00:05:40.970> this<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.450> then<00:05:41.540> he'd

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
maybe you could do this and then he'd

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.140 
maybe you could do this and then he'd
have<00:05:41.720> is<00:05:42.169> handling<00:05:43.040> like<00:05:43.250> this<00:05:43.490> you<00:05:43.940> can

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
have is handling like this you can

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.960 
have is handling like this you can
rotate<00:05:44.390> his<00:05:44.630> fist<00:05:44.900> on<00:05:45.020> this<00:05:45.229> side<00:05:45.760> on<00:05:46.760> this

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
rotate his fist on this side on this

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.640 
rotate his fist on this side on this
side<00:05:47.030> only<00:05:47.330> rotates<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:47.960> moves<00:05:47.990> at<00:05:48.229> the<00:05:48.290> elbow

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
side only rotates and moves at the elbow

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.600 
side only rotates and moves at the elbow
his<00:05:49.580> fingers<00:05:49.910> do<00:05:50.060> open<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.419> little<00:05:50.570> bit<00:05:50.690> I

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
his fingers do open a little bit I

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.969 
his fingers do open a little bit I
should<00:05:52.610> prefer<00:05:53.320> but<00:05:54.320> but<00:05:54.500> he<00:05:54.560> doesn't<00:05:54.860> rotate

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
should prefer but but he doesn't rotate

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.530 
should prefer but but he doesn't rotate
the<00:05:55.220> wrist<00:05:55.430> because<00:05:55.580> he's<00:05:55.820> got<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.030> launching

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540

kind of fist punch gimmick as you see
his<00:06:00.770> face<00:06:00.979> I<00:06:01.490> didn't<00:06:02.270> paint<00:06:02.450> those<00:06:02.630> teeth<00:06:02.900> so

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410
