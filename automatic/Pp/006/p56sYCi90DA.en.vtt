00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 good using this sierra madrileña I do not know 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.670
 if you know it but the sense m-13 is 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.620
 located totally in the sierra 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.389
 Madrid and another thing not proffered 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.360
 we have enough as you see we always go 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.009
 very warm and another of the things that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
 has live in the sierra madrileña is 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 that traveling by public transport is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.230
 tedious then here you have car the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.670
 transportation by own or you're dead and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.080
 As you know, I do not have or have 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.970
 card I do not intend to have 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.770
 So what I did was go buy 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.450
 a bicycle and basically the way 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.220
 all day through the mountains with the 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.920
 bicycle is this that you see here is 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.980
 quite in morona pretty cool things 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.690
 and from there you can see well the case is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.720
 Since the day I bought it, it has 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.330
 given problems and make pretty noises 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.769
 weird so before a driver 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.650
 that I run over or you hit me or send me 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.150
 to take for sack by sack decided 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.390
 take it to the mechanic to took one 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.670
 eye 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.200
 Certainly call to all 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.690
 drivers of the world please be a 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.550
 little bit more supportive with cyclists 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.920
 enough effort enough 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.750
 We are already pedaling 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.830
 that has to put up with attitudes 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.830
 sometimes a little 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.360
 I will not say arrogant but I think that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.789
 the word arrogant is the right one 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.560
 in short, I'm going inside that I have to 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.850
 I have now with the mechanic so that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 Take a look and I'll tell you what has 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.369
 told a story he told me 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.810
 in Boston 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.060
 what is the use of having the stick yes no 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.460
 OK 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.960
 that has already gone for the bicycle and nothing 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.749
 at the end it is because it seems that it is not 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.890
 more than my own paranoia what 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.020
 have basically done it has been taking him 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.819
 the chain oiling the again have 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.520
 revised that all the gears 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.560
 they worked well and according to that in the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 mechanic is all perfect so no 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.189
 I have complained and why because for that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 mediate if the bicycle is at times and 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.890
 is that I'm also very maniac of 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.200
 done I think that's my part more 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.540
 catalan Catalan and it is the fact that 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.069
 I almost always use guarantees shot 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.269
 when he buys a product I think he does not 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.580
 there's been a console that sent the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.460
 technical service I think there has not been 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.020
 after all electronic that of one or the other 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 I was not spoiled and has 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.650
 taken advantage of the two years of 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.750
 guarantee that we have here in Spain 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.960
 for them to go with the iphone for example 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.000
 shortly after having it, they gave me another 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.920
 new because I broke one of the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.180
 buttons 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.190
 and we have always tried to do this 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.110
 type of tricks 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.110
 finally clippers what 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.370
 that kill me the least, you just 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:00.550
 see from the day measure you can comment 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.660
 I like to say hello 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.140
