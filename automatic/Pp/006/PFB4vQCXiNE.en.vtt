00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
it will never be ready to fight Floyd I
think<00:01:17.130> Floyd<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> genius<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> guys<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
think Floyd is just a genius the guys in

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.600 
think Floyd is just a genius the guys in
just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> completely<00:01:20.009> different<00:01:20.460> level

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just a completely different level

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.560 
just a completely different level
compared<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.420> Danny<00:01:22.229> Garcia<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.330> see<00:01:24.330> Floyd

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
compared to Danny Garcia I see Floyd

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380 
compared to Danny Garcia I see Floyd
winning<00:01:24.990> may<00:01:25.920> definitely<00:01:26.520> unanimous

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
winning may definitely unanimous

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.280 
winning may definitely unanimous
decision<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.320> maybe<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.640> judge<00:01:30.290> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
decision if not maybe the judge the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
decision if not maybe the judge the
judge<00:01:31.530> will<00:01:31.799> probably<00:01:31.829> robbed<00:01:32.520> him<00:01:32.670> again<00:01:32.909> but

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
judge will probably robbed him again but

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.569 
judge will probably robbed him again but
I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.900> Floyd<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.290> definitely<00:01:34.799> win<00:01:34.950> but

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
I think Floyd will definitely win but

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
I think Floyd will definitely win but

else

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.770 
else
because<00:02:14.430> he<00:02:14.879> doesn't<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.239> want<00:02:15.329> to<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.629> any

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
because he doesn't really want to do any

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.309

guys like jejeje and those guys I don't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.539

think<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.530> will<00:02:22.680> ever<00:02:22.769> happen<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.340> Danny

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
think it will ever happen so Danny

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.229 
think it will ever happen so Danny
Garcia<00:02:23.999> it's<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:25.200> man<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.620> think<00:02:26.030> Floyd<00:02:27.030> will

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
Garcia it's the man I think Floyd will

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.660 
Garcia it's the man I think Floyd will
fight<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.480> me<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:28.079> not<00:02:28.739> me<00:02:28.889> like<00:02:29.219> I<00:02:29.310> said<00:02:29.370> maybe

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.479 
fight on me if not me like I said maybe
September<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.620> even<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.889> fight<00:02:32.099> happens

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
September and even if this fight happens

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.610 
September and even if this fight happens
two<00:02:33.180> years<00:02:33.420> from<00:02:33.569> now<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> think<00:02:33.959> Floyd<00:02:34.409> will

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
two years from now I think Floyd will

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.190 
two years from now I think Floyd will
win<00:02:34.879> I<00:02:35.879> just<00:02:36.299> think<00:02:36.450> Floyd's<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.139> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
win I just think Floyd's just in a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.959 
win I just think Floyd's just in a
completely<00:02:37.560> different<00:02:38.189> level<00:02:38.310> even<00:02:38.639> at<00:02:38.849> this

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
completely different level even at this

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.849 
completely different level even at this
age<00:02:39.180> 36<00:02:39.810> years<00:02:40.019> old<00:02:40.169> I<00:02:40.290> mean<00:02:40.469> that<00:02:40.650> age

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
age 36 years old I mean that age

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.759 
age 36 years old I mean that age
difference<00:02:41.450> Danny<00:02:42.450> Garcia<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.959> more<00:02:43.409> than<00:02:43.530> 10

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
difference Danny Garcia is more than 10

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.159 
difference Danny Garcia is more than 10
years<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:44.129> think<00:02:44.280> he's<00:02:44.370> 11<00:02:44.760> years<00:02:44.790> younger<00:02:45.169> the

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
years I think he's 11 years younger the

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.839 
years I think he's 11 years younger the
Styles<00:02:46.590> yes<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.180> Styles<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.750> FOID<00:02:49.260> style
