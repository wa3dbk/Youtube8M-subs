00:04:59.429 --> 00:04:59.439 
currently how the amiibos are

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.040 
currently how the amiibos are
implemented<00:05:00.039> into<00:05:00.430> Mario<00:05:00.699> Kart<00:05:00.969> 8<00:05:01.150> don't<00:05:01.870> know

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
implemented into Mario Kart 8 don't know

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.540 
implemented into Mario Kart 8 don't know
how<00:05:02.319> it's<00:05:02.499> going<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.740> expand<00:05:03.159> if<00:05:03.279> it's<00:05:03.430> going

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
how it's going to expand if it's going

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.499 
how it's going to expand if it's going

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
obviously the game that takes the most

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.600 
obviously the game that takes the most
advantage<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.379> these<00:05:08.499> characters<00:05:08.979> is<00:05:09.009> Smash
