I come in a higher protein diet because
we<00:03:06.160> look<00:03:06.400> at<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.610> research<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.060> high<00:03:07.390> protein

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
we look at the research a high protein

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.870 
we look at the research a high protein

ramped<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.700> that's<00:03:15.820> wrong<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.269> it's<00:03:16.390> not

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
ramped and that's wrong and it's not

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.300 
ramped and that's wrong and it's not
right<00:03:16.720> it's<00:03:16.780> actually<00:03:17.200> bad<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
right it's actually bad for you but I

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.160 
right it's actually bad for you but I
digress<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:19.269> which<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:19.690> do<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.870> wanna<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.109> a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
digress so which one do you wanna have a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.599 
digress so which one do you wanna have a
moderate<00:03:20.470> amount<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.739> protein<00:03:20.920> because<00:03:21.250> too

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
moderate amount of protein because too

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.370 
moderate amount of protein because too
much<00:03:21.760> protein<00:03:22.030> will<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.600> converted<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.319> a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
much protein will be converted in a

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.740 
much protein will be converted in a
process<00:03:23.680> called<00:03:23.859> gluconeogenesis<00:03:24.750> everybody

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
process called gluconeogenesis everybody

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.199 
process called gluconeogenesis everybody

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
body just doesn't eating it just doesn't

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.360

want<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.150> there<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.859> another<00:03:35.980> step

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
want it in there so that is another step

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.979 
want it in there so that is another step
so<00:03:36.850> that's<00:03:36.970> really<00:03:37.120> what<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.600> comes<00:03:37.690> down<00:03:37.780> to

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so that's really what it comes down to
