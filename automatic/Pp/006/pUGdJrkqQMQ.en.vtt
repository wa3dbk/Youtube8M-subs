00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 hi to all in Aix and today I 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.799
 are going to present a tutorial incites so 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.799
 that one 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 so it's called the abdullah so there is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
 two ways to do it there is like I 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.380
 do it like that you tighten up to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:37.469
 legs and you get up or ya like 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 it makes you put like that here 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.680
 I do not like it so I'm you 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.329
 learn so already thoughtful way 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.300
 this is the side where you will burn him 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.940
 to learn it like that because 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.610
 after we go in this direction we want 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.780
 send it to the temple in the other 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.949
 also but sees taken to master 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.050
 their temples and where it was necessary 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:07.439
 think so in mind the goal it's going to be 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.540
 to turn like that so the balloon he 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.990
 happens like this 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 the leg this one she will spend on it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.110
 like that after the ball will get there 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.240
 to go in the ball on that leg and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.240
 here is it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.170
 so our way like the balloon he 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.980
 happens the up 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.590
 you only have the east not the leg 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.760
 blame down below the knee you 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.760
 go wait a long time tops 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:51.710
 So here I do you hop we pass the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 leg on we get balloon and hop 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 so here I describe them the movement 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.750
 you send it she falls there you have it 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.030
 received like that here you go 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.700
 you lean like that or not it's 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.360
 the other leg on it hop you take it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.160
 with their legs 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.970
 you will squeeze your leg the ball goes 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.970
 roll once there you hop like that hop 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.500
 shows you two sides 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.410
 see the other way 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.510
 here is ben beh soon the 100 subscribers 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.150
 frankly it's great fun I 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.430
 you will do a little special video 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.990
 in quotation marks I thought to show you 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.090
 a little where I trained to do like 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.400
 that and make half an hour 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.950
 drive while being filmed there 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.260
 see this after a half hour video 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 in a house workout what and 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:21.770
 then here is hutteau was 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.330
 asked by a subscriber and he told me 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.980
 described but I understood myself 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.370
 this one price I hesitated with those there 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.200
 also so you have it there you find 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.250
 a way to block it like that and 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:40.790
 you do I go away a little bit here 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.660
 you have here we shifted like that you 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.250
 turn place that's it so I have 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.500
 hesitated to suhler I think it
