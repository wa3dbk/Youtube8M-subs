who are stomping their way through the
90s<00:00:26.189> console<00:00:26.699> war<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.810> were<00:00:27.869> missing

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
90s console war but they were missing

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.370 
90s console war but they were missing
something<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:29.010> very<00:00:29.279> important<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.380> mascot

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
something very very important a mascot

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.069 
something very very important a mascot
and<00:00:31.619> flagship<00:00:32.219> series<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.450> up

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and flagship series to go with it up

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.959 
and flagship series to go with it up
until<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.559> point<00:00:34.620> Sega's<00:00:35.340> mascot<00:00:35.370> had

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
until that point Sega's mascot had

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.630 
until that point Sega's mascot had
actually<00:00:36.300> been<00:00:36.420> Alex<00:00:36.809> Kidd<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:38.070> believe

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
actually been Alex Kidd and I believe

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
actually been Alex Kidd and I believe
the<00:00:38.910> reasoning<00:00:39.300> behind<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.750> change<00:00:40.050> was

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the reasoning behind the change was

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
the reasoning behind the change was
actually<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.309> felt<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.640> Alex

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
actually because they felt that Alex

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.930 
actually because they felt that Alex
Kidd<00:00:42.329> wasn't<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.899> iconic<00:00:43.379> enough<00:00:44.250> which

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Kidd wasn't really iconic enough which

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.270 
Kidd wasn't really iconic enough which
to<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.270> fair<00:00:45.420> he<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:45.960> wasn't<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.070> has

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to be fair he really wasn't but he has

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.819 
to be fair he really wasn't but he has
made<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.670> number<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> cameos<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.320> number<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
made a number of cameos in a number of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
made a number of cameos in a number of
games<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> company<00:00:50.789> since<00:00:51.120> his<00:00:51.390> eventual

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
games by the company since his eventual

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.439 
games by the company since his eventual
demise<00:00:52.199> before<00:00:53.160> Sega's<00:00:53.820> design<00:00:54.180> team

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
demise before Sega's design team

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.939 
demise before Sega's design team
actually<00:00:54.840> came<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.170> Sonic<00:00:55.649> they

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
actually came up with Sonic they

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
actually came up with Sonic they
actually<00:00:56.280> designed<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.910> bunny<00:00:57.270> an<00:00:57.600> armadillo

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
actually designed a bunny an armadillo

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
actually designed a bunny an armadillo
and<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.890> dog

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and a dog

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.099 
and a dog
and<00:00:59.460> while<00:01:00.270> these<00:01:00.420> characters<00:01:00.930> themselves

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and while these characters themselves

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.399 
and while these characters themselves
have<00:01:01.710> never<00:01:02.070> been<00:01:02.309> used<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.760> anything<00:01:03.409> aspects

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
have never been used in anything aspects

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
have never been used in anything aspects
of<00:01:04.619> them<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.519> other

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
of them have been put into other

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
of them have been put into other
characters<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.860> really

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
characters I think that's a really

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.710 
characters I think that's a really
really<00:01:08.369> nice<00:01:08.520> thing<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:08.850> Sega<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> because

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
really nice thing for Sega to do because

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.830 
really nice thing for Sega to do because
it<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:09.930> shows<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.880> they<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.180> neglect

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it really shows that they don't neglect

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
it really shows that they don't neglect
their<00:01:13.080> artists<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.280> appreciate

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
their artists they really appreciate

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
their artists they really appreciate
their<00:01:15.299> artists<00:01:15.840> work<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.640> understand<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
their artists work and understand that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
their artists work and understand that
if<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.030> can't<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.330> used<00:01:18.420> there<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
if it can't be used there it can

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.640 
if it can't be used there it can
definitely<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:20.009> used<00:01:20.369> somewhere<00:01:20.939> else

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
definitely be used somewhere else

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
definitely be used somewhere else
eventually<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.220> spiky<00:01:23.880> blue<00:01:24.090> hedgehog<00:01:24.570> called

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
eventually a spiky blue hedgehog called

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
eventually a spiky blue hedgehog called
mister<00:01:25.229> needle<00:01:25.560> Mouse<00:01:25.740> would<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.250> chosen

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
mister needle Mouse would be chosen

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
mister needle Mouse would be chosen
he<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.570> made<00:01:27.780> blue<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.439> match<00:01:28.560> Sega's<00:01:29.100> logo

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
he was made blue to match Sega's logo

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.670 
he was made blue to match Sega's logo
which<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.170> good<00:01:31.530> decision

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
which I think was a really good decision

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
which I think was a really good decision
and<00:01:32.250> helped<00:01:32.579> him<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.600> iconic<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and helped him be a lot more iconic a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.660 
and helped him be a lot more iconic a
fun<00:01:35.220> fact

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
fun fact

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550 
fun fact
is<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.970> his<00:01:36.150> shoes<00:01:36.420> were<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:37.170> designed

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is that his shoes were actually designed

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
is that his shoes were actually designed
as<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> reference<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> Michael<00:01:38.880> Jackson's<00:01:39.479> bad

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900

through the years his overall design has

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
through the years his overall design has
been<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> change<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.290> match<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> medium<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
been a change to match the medium it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.850 
been a change to match the medium it's
in<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:51.210> these<00:01:51.509> days<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.290> used<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> seeing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
in like these days was so used to seeing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
in like these days was so used to seeing
a<00:01:53.070> sonic<00:01:53.399> head<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.670> relatively<00:01:54.149> tall<00:01:54.540> he's
