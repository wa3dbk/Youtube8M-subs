indicator<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.380> front<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.310> showing<00:01:41.700> us

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
indicator on the front it's showing us

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.130 
indicator on the front it's showing us
that<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> five<00:01:42.479> five<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> quarter

that we have five five and a quarter

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.580 
that we have five five and a quarter
bays<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.750> looks<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.110> from<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.470> on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
bays and then it looks like from here on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.569 
bays and then it looks like from here on
down<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> mesh<00:01:47.850> paneling<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
down is just the mesh paneling on the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.289 
down is just the mesh paneling on the
top<00:01:51.110> we<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.740> appears<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> 200

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
top we have one appears to be a 200

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.630 
top we have one appears to be a 200
millimeter<00:01:54.600> fan<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> then<00:01:55.979> mounting<00:01:56.399> for

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
millimeter fan and then mounting for

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
millimeter fan and then mounting for
another<00:01:56.939> appears<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.810> 120<00:01:58.409> millimeter<00:01:58.770> fan

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
another appears to be 120 millimeter fan

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.819 
another appears to be 120 millimeter fan
and<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.790> side<00:02:00.060> pretty<00:02:01.049> basic<00:02:01.290> pretty

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and so on this side pretty basic pretty

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.860 
and so on this side pretty basic pretty
clean<00:02:02.070> panel

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.580 

on<00:02:06.870> this<00:02:07.110> side<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.940> have<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.410> viewing<00:02:10.410> window

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
on this side we have a viewing window

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.180 
on this side we have a viewing window
and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.090> course<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:13.190> 200

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and then of course you see 200

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.170 
and then of course you see 200
millimeter<00:02:14.520> fan<00:02:15.590> which<00:02:16.790> you'll<00:02:17.790> notice<00:02:18.120> right

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
millimeter fan which you'll notice right

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.630 
millimeter fan which you'll notice right
up<00:02:18.420> here<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:18.750> actually<00:02:18.990> have<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> lock<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.370> keys

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
up here we actually have a lock the keys
