00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There were once three brothers

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.010
 In time, the brothers reached a river

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:15.035
too deep to wade through

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.060
and too dangerous to swim across.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.085
However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.110
and so they simply waved their wands

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.135
and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.185
And Death spoke to them.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.210
He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims,

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:47.235
for travelers usually drowned in the river.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.960
But Death was cunning.

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:55.985
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic and said

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.910
that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:06.135
So the oldest brother, who was a combative man,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.060
 asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence:

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:16.185
a wand that must always win duels for its owner,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.010
a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death!

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:26.135
So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.960
fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:36.085
Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further,

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:43.235
and asked for the power to recall others from Death.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother,

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:53.285
and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.210
And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like.

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:03.235
The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.860
and he did not trust Death.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:10.085
So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.010
without being followed by Death.

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:19.935
And death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.060
Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way,

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:35.085
and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Deathâ€™s gifts.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.010
In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:45.035
The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.960
sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:53.085
Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.010
he could not fail to win the duel that followed.

00:02:56.035 --> 00:03:02.035
Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.060
where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself,

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.085
and of how it made him invincible.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.010
That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay,

00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:20.035
wine-sodden, upon his bed. The theif took the wand and,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.960
 for good measure, slit the oldest brotherâ€™s throat.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:27.985
And so Death took the first brother for his own.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.010
Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone.

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:40.035
Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.060
To his amazement and his delight,

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:48.085
the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.110
before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:55.935
Yet she was silent and cold, separated from him as by a veil.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.060
Though she had returned to the mortal world,

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:03.085
she did not truly belong there and suffered.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.010
Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing,

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:12.035
killed himself so as truly to join her.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.060
And so Death took the second brother for his own.

00:04:16.085 --> 00:04:21.085
But though Death searched for the third brother for many years,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.110
he was never able to find him.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:27.035
It was only when he had attained a great age

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.060
 that the he finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:39.085
And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.010
gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.
