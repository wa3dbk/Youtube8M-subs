00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that you have to ride through definitely

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.360 
that you have to ride through definitely
fewer<00:01:27.630> girls<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> bunches<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.329> and

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.550 

the<00:01:33.370> American<00:01:33.880> races<00:01:34.300> they<00:01:34.660> have<00:01:34.900> chocolate

mean<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.480> guess<00:01:40.510> also<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.200> think<00:01:41.290> probably<00:01:41.590> the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
mean I guess also I think probably the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.350 
mean I guess also I think probably the
crowds<00:01:42.010> in<00:01:42.190> America<00:01:42.610> are<00:01:42.700> slightly<00:01:42.910> larger

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
crowds in America are slightly larger

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.090 
crowds in America are slightly larger
compared<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.780> Europe<00:01:44.080> for<00:01:44.200> most<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.710> races

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
compared to Europe for most of the races

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.340 
compared to Europe for most of the races
except<00:01:45.400> for<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.910> Europe<00:01:46.150> where<00:01:46.330> we<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.600> races

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
except for in Europe where we do races

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.110 
except for in Europe where we do races
well<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.980> men<00:01:48.160> start<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.730> finish<00:01:48.760> at<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
well the men start and finish at the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.150

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
same place I think for the only time we

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.520 
same place I think for the only time we
have<00:01:51.280> bigger<00:01:51.490> crowds<00:01:51.790> in<00:01:52.350> Europe<00:01:53.350> than<00:01:53.470> in
