00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
this new design I understand this is the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.319 
this new design I understand this is the
second<00:02:35.069> version<00:02:35.219> of<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.519> design<00:02:35.879> for<00:02:36.209> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
second version of the design for the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.690 
second version of the design for the
ipad<00:02:36.689> they<00:02:36.870> originally<00:02:37.290> had<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:38.280> design<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
ipad they originally had a design that

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
ipad they originally had a design that
was<00:02:39.060> much<00:02:39.359> like<00:02:39.719> the<00:02:39.750> otterbox<00:02:40.409> decide<00:02:41.069> where

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
was much like the otterbox decide where

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.699 
was much like the otterbox decide where
there<00:02:41.609> is<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> built<00:02:41.969> in<00:02:42.120> front<00:02:42.419> screen<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.680> it

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
there is a built in front screen but it

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.339 
there is a built in front screen but it
was<00:02:44.010> probably<00:02:44.189> clipping<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.659> actions<00:02:46.079> of<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
was probably clipping the actions of the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.770 
was probably clipping the actions of the
ipad<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.669> they<00:02:47.790> did<00:02:47.849> was<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.269> went<00:02:48.719> away

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
ipad so what they did was they went away

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300 
ipad so what they did was they went away
with<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.439> just<00:02:49.500> did<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.859> a<00:02:49.919> clip-on

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
with that and just did like a clip-on

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.709 
with that and just did like a clip-on
style<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.510> which<00:02:51.810> would<00:02:53.719> basically

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:54.719 
style you know which would basically

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.599 
style you know which would basically
still<00:02:55.290> give<00:02:55.439> you<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> same<00:02:55.829> functions<00:02:56.400> as

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
still give you the same functions as

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.509 
still give you the same functions as
before<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.859> know<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.040> would<00:02:59.250> still<00:02:59.459> have

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
before but you know you would still have

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.069 
before but you know you would still have
to<00:02:59.669> use<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.879> screen<00:03:00.150> protector<00:03:00.329> just<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:00.930> with

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079
