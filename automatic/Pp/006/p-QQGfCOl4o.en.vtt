00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 every month astronomers discover planets 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.690
 similar to the earth and every time it seems 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 more obvious that our planet is not 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 the only habitable now the nasa has 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.370
 published a book where he details how 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.839
 we could contact the aliens 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.170
 some of the chapters of the book of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.390
 300 pages that is titled archeology 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.609
 anthropology and communications 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 interstellar and that has been edited by 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.960
 tobacco companies that address the issue 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.019
 of extraterrestrial communication in the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.899
 past present and future in a section 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.239
 for example William Edmondson of the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.160
 college of birmingham considers the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.280
 possibility that rock art in 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 the earth is of extraterrestrial origin 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 we know very little or nothing about the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.309
 meaning of those inscriptions because 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.280
 were created or who did it 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.320
 write and add to all effects 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.840
 could have been made by 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 extraterrestrial if a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.859
 radio signal in an experiment the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 ceti search institute 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.650
 extraterrestrial intelligence for its 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.050
 acronym in English 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.390
 we could not know for sure that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.980
 other intelligence exists but we do not 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.350
 we would find out what they are 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.990
 saying they write the introduction of the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.850
 book and explains that if they detect we do 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.820
 a civilization in one of our 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.900
 closest star neighbors 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.730
 will mean that your signals will have 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.860
 travel billions of 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.380
 kilometers and they reach the earth after 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.330
 of traveling for years in the book 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.040
 bakook and his colleagues tackle these 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.930
 same problems and provide 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.540
 solutions that can be very 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.640
 valuable in the future to go beyond 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.890
 of the mere detection of such intelligence 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.470
 and to have some realistic possibility 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.180
 to understand it we can get a lot of 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.100
 the lessons learned by the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.070
 researchers who face challenges 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.140
 similar on earth continues like 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.300
 that the archaeologists that rebuild 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.940
 civilizations distant in time to 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.770
 fragmentary evidence base is expected 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.990
 that seti researchers can 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.759
 rebuild distant civilizations 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 separated from us by vast 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.310
 Extensions of space and time adds
