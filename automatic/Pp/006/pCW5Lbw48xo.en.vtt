to mount on the fender wells here and
here<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.130> it's<00:00:37.310> pretty<00:00:37.490> much<00:00:37.580> just<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:38.000> large

engine<00:01:42.530> up<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:44.600> have<00:01:44.780> two<00:01:45.020> bolts<00:01:45.319> we're<00:01:45.560> gonna

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
engine up we have two bolts we're gonna

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.230 
engine up we have two bolts we're gonna
deal<00:01:45.950> with<00:01:46.750> one<00:01:47.750> here<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:49.640> here

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
deal with one here and one here

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.300 
deal with one here and one here
I'm<00:01:50.630> gonna<00:01:50.810> start<00:01:51.080> off<00:01:51.229> by<00:01:51.259> undoing<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.069> one

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
I'm gonna start off by undoing this one

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.300 
I'm gonna start off by undoing this one
here<00:01:52.580> first<00:01:55.450> takes<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.569> 17<00:01:57.140> millimeter<00:01:57.619> socket

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
here first takes a 17 millimeter socket

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.029 
here first takes a 17 millimeter socket
whenever<00:01:59.179> dealing<00:01:59.600> with<00:01:59.720> these<00:01:59.869> larger<00:02:00.470> nuts

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
whenever dealing with these larger nuts

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.550 
whenever dealing with these larger nuts
and<00:02:01.280> bolts<00:02:01.610> I'd<00:02:01.759> suggest<00:02:02.209> using<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:03.080> 1/2<00:02:03.319> inch

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
and bolts I'd suggest using a 1/2 inch

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.620 
and bolts I'd suggest using a 1/2 inch
drive<00:02:03.709> or<00:02:04.420> larger<00:02:05.530> ratchet<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:07.119> 3/8<00:02:08.119> drive<00:02:08.360> will

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
drive or larger ratchet a 3/8 drive will

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.779 
drive or larger ratchet a 3/8 drive will
probably<00:02:09.020> work<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> short<00:02:09.830> term<00:02:10.130> but

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
probably work in the short term but

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.730 
probably work in the short term but
after<00:02:11.120> repeated<00:02:11.599> use<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:12.380> may<00:02:12.530> damage

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
after repeated use you may damage

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.240 
after repeated use you may damage
erratic

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.070 

break<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> bolt<00:02:17.330> loose<00:02:17.450> there<00:02:17.750> once<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.990> have

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
break the bolt loose there once you have

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.680 
break the bolt loose there once you have
broke<00:02:18.350> loose<00:02:18.940> most<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.240> time<00:02:20.450> they'll

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
broke loose most of the time they'll

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.070 
broke loose most of the time they'll
spin<00:02:20.930> off<00:02:21.080> by<00:02:21.320> hand

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080
