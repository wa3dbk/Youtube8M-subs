00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:23.650

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:27.880
 I'll show you, it 's a model nation. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.160
 It's the model already showed it but I found it 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.379
 Very cool, I decided to bring it to you. 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.830
 very easy and efficient as it provides 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.750
 fire and I had to make a mess 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.879
 To do this here because I have 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.100
 vary somewhat from the style he made the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.629
 game he did and made straight right was not 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 this circular style so I 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.049
 I think it's cool and it should pass to you. 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.549

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:58.390
