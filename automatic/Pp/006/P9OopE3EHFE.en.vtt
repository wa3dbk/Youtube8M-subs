major region is finishing so let's go in

major region is finishing so let's go in
back<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.440> take<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> look<00:04:34.740> at<00:04:35.010> how<00:04:35.100> they're

when it comes to preventing spalling and
scaling<00:04:40.290> this<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:41.070> really<00:04:41.490> where<00:04:41.640> it<00:04:41.760> all

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
scaling this is really where it all

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.000 
scaling this is really where it all
happens<00:04:42.300> right<00:04:42.450> here<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.080> finishing<00:04:43.500> process

you<00:04:44.400> can't<00:04:44.700> over<00:04:45.000> finish<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.420> concrete<00:04:45.600> and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
you can't over finish the concrete and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.020 
you can't over finish the concrete and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
once the concrete's down you never ever

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.330

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
want to add water to the surface if I

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.190 
want to add water to the surface if I
were<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.640> overwork<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.390> and<00:04:51.630> continue<00:04:52.080> to

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
were to overwork this and continue to

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.380 
were to overwork this and continue to
float<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.010> would<00:04:53.700> bring<00:04:53.910> more<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.210> more

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
float this I would bring more and more

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.690 
float this I would bring more and more
cream<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> surface<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:56.040> that<00:04:56.310> cream

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
cream to the surface it's that cream

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.120 
cream to the surface it's that cream
that<00:04:57.000> causes<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.570> problem<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.410> overwork<00:04:58.860> it

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
that causes the problem you overwork it

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.340 
that causes the problem you overwork it
or<00:04:59.340> if<00:04:59.550> it's<00:04:59.700> too<00:04:59.940> wet<00:05:00.150> by<00:05:00.630> adding<00:05:00.960> water<00:05:01.140> to

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
or if it's too wet by adding water to

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.120 
or if it's too wet by adding water to
this<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:03.270> sure<00:05:03.540> is<00:05:03.750> easier<00:05:04.230> to<00:05:04.410> work<00:05:04.590> but<00:05:05.010> all

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
this it sure is easier to work but all

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.100 
this it sure is easier to work but all
that<00:05:05.310> water<00:05:05.520> does<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:06.210> bring<00:05:06.480> up<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.810> cream

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
that water does is bring up that cream

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.380 
that water does is bring up that cream
and<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.380> can<00:05:07.530> see<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:07.890> this<00:05:08.520> right<00:05:08.820> here<00:05:09.240> is

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
and you can see it this right here is

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.550 
and you can see it this right here is
the<00:05:10.050> culprit

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
the culprit

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.290 
the culprit
you<00:05:10.950> make<00:05:11.130> too<00:05:11.340> much<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.730> cream<00:05:12.000> layer

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
you make too much of a cream layer

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.360 
you make too much of a cream layer
that's<00:05:13.110> what's<00:05:13.350> going<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.530> pop<00:05:13.740> off<00:05:14.010> when<00:05:14.280> you

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
that's what's going to pop off when you

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.270 
that's what's going to pop off when you
get<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:14.610> freeze-thaw<00:05:15.150> expansion<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:17.160> the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
get that freeze-thaw expansion so the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.600 
get that freeze-thaw expansion so the
critical<00:05:17.640> thing<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.060> don't<00:05:18.270> over

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
critical thing is don't over

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:35.450 
critical thing is don't over
finish<00:05:19.289> don't<00:05:20.289> overwater

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.950 

you

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.020 

you
