00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 well in this video that is showing this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.600
 programmer area and of which is a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 programmer very easy to be 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.530
 scheduled to show you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 this programmer is the model is tst is from 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.090
 220 volts supply of 48 63 relays and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.070
 law 16 grip 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 if you need a larger current 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 You 're going to have to be connected to a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.820
 contactor internally for this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:36.719
 using a larger current 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.879
 turning the equipment on and off. 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.960
 is damaging this unit 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.230
 we have the power outlet where you are 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 keep and it always charged always 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 let me know that we have here the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.199
 common relief in gnr where you will see 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.750
 I commanded you 're triggering some 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.170
 equipment or boards connecting some 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.510
 equipment and externally tip 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.100
 within a panel in the case of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.400
 here we use to try to hang up 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.030
 the pump is a bank of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.760
 capacitors, among others 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.140
 his programming is very easy here 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.290
 We're not in our time to vote. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.270
 resetting it to make 10 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.270
 programming that start all over again 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.200
 it's been a ready result but here's 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.619
 zero to show you to the program 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.490
 the hour by hour he the time of the debate is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.799
 pressing 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.590
 this button that forms the drawing of a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.170
 clock is choosing day of the week 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 will be changing to 1 in the case today is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.409
 Friday to choose the time when 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.500
 You pass tight here in three minutes. 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.759
 The boat you're here is always holding on. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.090

 Lion King statue on off and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 in automatic mode it 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.459
 we also have the option of placing in the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.760
 daylight saving time and to program just 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 sin that tobi will have the levels there goes 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.910
 have 10 where you are programming and he 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:39.150
 It's enough for sleep to reread for now. 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.760
 showing is on or off for 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.400
 program just press pro as I already said

 in case I'm going to put here good Saturday 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.870
 Saturday and Sunday programming account 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.159

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.360

 will be on Sunday 1st schedule 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.709
 carpets want to know more programming already 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.579
 just click here it will change that 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.790

 off and so on the back 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.810

 have to test the equipment will connect 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.990
 to vote for lack the mate you tighten 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:43.140
