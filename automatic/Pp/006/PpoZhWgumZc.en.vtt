so let's preserve nature let's leave it
how<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.740> found<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.449> want

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
how we found it I know you really want

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
how we found it I know you really want
to<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.900> touch<00:00:28.140> those<00:00:28.380> tufa<00:00:28.680> towers<00:00:28.820> but<00:00:29.820> don't

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
to go touch those tufa towers but don't

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
to go touch those tufa towers but don't
leave<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.599> 2<00:00:30.750> 4<00:00:30.990> towers<00:00:31.349> alone<00:00:31.800> let's

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
leave the 2 4 towers alone let's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.030 
leave the 2 4 towers alone let's
preserve<00:00:32.790> them<00:00:33.059> forever<00:00:33.770> for<00:00:34.770> all<00:00:34.890> the

visitors<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> enjoy<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> might<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.440> wondering

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
visitors to enjoy you might be wondering

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.790 
visitors to enjoy you might be wondering
what<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> heck<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> tufa<00:00:38.910> tower<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.800> Eric

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
what the heck is a tufa tower and Eric

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
what the heck is a tufa tower and Eric
is<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> guy<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> ask<00:00:41.520> Eric<00:00:42.210> being<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is the guy to ask Eric being a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.260 
is the guy to ask Eric being a
naturalist<00:00:43.250> what<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.550> heck<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.850> tufa<00:00:45.239> towers

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
naturalist what the heck are tufa towers

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.139 
naturalist what the heck are tufa towers
and<00:00:45.899> why<00:00:46.230> should<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.739> touch<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.250> good

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
and why should we not touch them good

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.650 
and why should we not touch them good
question<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.050> Tuva<00:00:49.469> tower<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
question so a Tuva tower and is a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
question so a Tuva tower and is a
limestone<00:00:51.660> formation<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.920> actually

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
limestone formation it's actually

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.479 
limestone formation it's actually
created<00:00:53.699> under<00:00:53.940> Mono<00:00:54.360> Lake<00:00:54.449> surface

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
created under Mono Lake surface

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.209 
created under Mono Lake surface
limestone<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.730> calcium<00:00:56.940> carbonate<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.219> Moana

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
limestone is calcium carbonate and Moana

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
limestone is calcium carbonate and Moana
Lake<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.609> actually<00:01:00.210> filled<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.780> carbonate

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
Lake is actually filled with carbonate

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
Lake is actually filled with carbonate
one<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:02.550> chemicals<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> of

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
one of the the two chemicals of the of

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
one of the the two chemicals of the of
limestone<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> other<00:01:06.750> half<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
limestone and so the other half of the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
limestone and so the other half of the
equation<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.860> calcium<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.729> where<00:01:08.880> does

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
equation then is calcium and where does

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.960 
equation then is calcium and where does
that<00:01:09.060> come<00:01:09.180> from<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> answer<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
that come from and the answer is that

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.130 
that come from and the answer is that
underground<00:01:11.970> Springs<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.570> bubbling<00:01:12.960> up

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
underground Springs are bubbling up

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.950 
underground Springs are bubbling up
underneath<00:01:13.530> Mono<00:01:13.950> Lake<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.390> carrying<00:01:15.750> just

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
underneath Mono Lake and carrying just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
underneath Mono Lake and carrying just
little<00:01:16.229> amounts<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> calcium<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
little amounts of calcium with them and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.200 
little amounts of calcium with them and
these<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.330> waters<00:01:18.659> mix<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.369> actually

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
these two waters mix and they actually

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.120 
these two waters mix and they actually
react<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.110> form<00:01:22.580> limestone<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.930> tufa<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
react and form limestone and tufa and so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
react and form limestone and tufa and so
we<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> call<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.060> fossilized<00:01:27.659> Springs

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we like to call these fossilized Springs

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
we like to call these fossilized Springs
and<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:29.159> they're<00:01:29.549> they're<00:01:30.240> sort<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and because they're they're sort of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
and because they're they're sort of
building<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.590> top<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.950> themselves<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
building on top of themselves as the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.710 
building on top of themselves as the
spring<00:01:33.119> flows<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.540> underneath<00:01:33.930> Mono<00:01:34.320> Lake<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
spring flows up underneath Mono Lake and

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
spring flows up underneath Mono Lake and
but<00:01:36.720> you'll<00:01:36.840> notice<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.520> tufa<00:01:38.520> towers<00:01:38.549> can

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
but you'll notice that tufa towers can

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.350 
but you'll notice that tufa towers can
only<00:01:39.210> form<00:01:40.140> underwater<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.220> anywhere<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> see

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
only form underwater so anywhere you see

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.530 
only form underwater so anywhere you see
an<00:01:42.420> exposed<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.170> fit<00:01:43.380> our<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
an exposed to fit our and you know that

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.969 
an exposed to fit our and you know that
the<00:01:45.840> lake<00:01:45.990> must<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.350> been<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:46.530> least<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the lake must have been at least that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.399 
the lake must have been at least that
high<00:01:47.159> back<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> early<00:01:48.030> 1940s<00:01:48.570> before<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
high back in the early 1940s before the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
high back in the early 1940s before the
water<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:50.460> diverted<00:01:50.909> away<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.149> Ronal

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
water was was diverted away from Ronal

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.560 
water was was diverted away from Ronal
lake<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.470> lake<00:01:52.500> level<00:01:52.920> dropped<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
lake and the lake level dropped and so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.969 
lake and the lake level dropped and so
now<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.930> they're<00:01:55.170> exposed<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.740> really

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
now that they're exposed it's really

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.590 
now that they're exposed it's really
important<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> protect<00:01:56.969> them<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.509> know

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
important to protect them you know

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440 
important to protect them you know
they're<00:01:57.780> obviously<00:01:57.960> exposed<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.920> an<00:01:59.450> erosion

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
they're obviously exposed to an erosion

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.020 
they're obviously exposed to an erosion
in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> form<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.320> wind<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.799> rain<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.909> also

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
in the form of wind and rain but also

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.660 
in the form of wind and rain but also
the<00:02:03.270> people<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:04.920> ask<00:02:05.070> tourists<00:02:05.490> not

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the people and so we do ask tourists not

much down here what are some of the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.520 
much down here what are some of the
other<00:02:19.830> natural<00:02:20.100> highlights<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:20.970> area

other natural highlights of this area

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.840 
other natural highlights of this area
Moana<00:02:22.530> Lake<00:02:22.770> has<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> really<00:02:23.340> amazing

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
Moana Lake has a really amazing

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.690 
Moana Lake has a really amazing
ecosystem<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.870> there's<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.130> incredible

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
ecosystem and there's not an incredible

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
ecosystem and there's not an incredible
diversity<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.420> species<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.020> live<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.410> Mono

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
diversity of species that live in Mono

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.980 
diversity of species that live in Mono
Lake<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> numbers<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.180> them<00:02:30.330> are<00:02:30.570> really

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
Lake but the numbers of them are really

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990 
Lake but the numbers of them are really
incredible<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> first<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.610> those<00:02:32.730> is

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
incredible and so the first of those is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.190 
incredible and so the first of those is
the<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:35.340> alkali<00:02:35.910> fly<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.540> lives<00:02:36.720> all<00:02:36.930> around

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the the alkali fly that lives all around

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830 
the the alkali fly that lives all around
the<00:02:37.560> shores<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:38.040> Mono<00:02:38.220> Lake<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.660> there's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the shores of Mono Lake and so there's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.870 
the shores of Mono Lake and so there's
millions<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.440> these<00:02:40.590> flies<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.730> been

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
millions of these flies and it's been

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
millions of these flies and it's been
their<00:02:42.000> entire<00:02:42.330> life<00:02:42.810> right<00:02:43.320> at<00:02:43.440> Mono<00:02:43.620> Lake<00:02:43.740> and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
their entire life right at Mono Lake and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.790 
their entire life right at Mono Lake and
and<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.300> there's<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.750> brine<00:02:46.320> shrimp<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and then there's the brine shrimp and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.650 
and then there's the brine shrimp and
the<00:02:47.250> brine<00:02:47.490> shrimp<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> most<00:02:48.090> abundant

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the brine shrimp is the most abundant

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.380 
the brine shrimp is the most abundant
species<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.290> Mono<00:02:49.560> Lake<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.209> there<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.360> be

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
species in Mono Lake and there can be

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.170 
species in Mono Lake and there can be
anywhere<00:02:51.870> from<00:02:52.110> four<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.770> ten<00:02:53.220> trillion<00:02:53.820> of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
anywhere from four to ten trillion of

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.570 
anywhere from four to ten trillion of
these<00:02:54.660> brine<00:02:55.170> shrimp<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.590> motor<00:02:55.800> oil<00:02:55.890> during

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
these brine shrimp in motor oil during

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.480 
these brine shrimp in motor oil during
peak<00:02:56.880> season<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.300> summer<00:02:57.530> yeah<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.190> both<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
peak season of summer yeah and both of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.030 
peak season of summer yeah and both of
these<00:02:59.760> species<00:03:00.570> make<00:03:00.990> really<00:03:01.410> excellent<00:03:01.740> bird

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
these species make really excellent bird

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
these species make really excellent bird
food<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.270> course<00:03:03.330> Moana<00:03:03.959> lake

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
