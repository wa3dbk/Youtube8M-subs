00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.350
 very nice cars, kids, welcome 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.879
 nenas to my channel is the creever and we're 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 they are counted in targets 2 and I bring you one 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.000
 new nuclear in this case as you see 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.980
 using the to him is to this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 light machine gun and many good me 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.040
 sad that if there was a game from 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 the start then I bring it here 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.449
 guys this game has started with the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 counter to zero as you see in the beginning 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.689
 of the gameplay we had not killed anyone 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 there was no point in the game 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.529
 had just started and well then as 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 you see then if I have that bm 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.130
 after 20 seconds since 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.439
 start killing because I already got the v6 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.690
 the pm and starts guys the streak of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.820
 nuclear as you see is practically 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.579
 pretty easy to get a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.320
 bone if you have the situation controlled 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.090
 As you can see I get into hot spot 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 tried to catch the maximum points 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 possible and get out if I see that the enemy 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 come in then kill the enemy I turn to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.309
 get to the point to take it in the 200 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.050
 extra points and I go back out like that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.760
 until I get the wizard and I can 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.300
 control the situation well of a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.129
 let's say that more ordered does not 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.629
 try not to go where they do not call me and 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 Do not catch me in the back etc. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.160
 so you'll say many many 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 you will say is better said than because 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.530
 used with the elstat the half point 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.060
 Red 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.920
 this strange is worth it because I'm 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.530
 using this and I do not have anything else 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.330
 the truth is that I do not know either had 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.640
 many accessories unlocked and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.049
 I tried the nuclear two or three times and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.970
 Well, I think the third game 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.430
 I think this is the third game 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.830
 I came out this nuclear I take it with point 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.130
 red and butt seems to me therefore 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.780
 well I do not know the big charger either 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.729
 I see it necessary in a shrapnel from the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.049
 light, much less then I think 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.149
 that these two accessories go a long way 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.810
 I could have put the search engine 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.939
 of whites but I saw the comments 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.429
 the people already flaming telling me piggy 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.770
 sorry I do not know that I do not know more and good 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.690
 apart from not having it unlocked I do not 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.640
 I thought about putting it for more than anything 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.830
 avoid those comments not since I 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.420
 normally not only did not know how to carry 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.039
 rapid fire in the module apart from is 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.289
 my last battle that kind of thing then 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.850
 I did not like them and here we say that 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.159
 the bad reputation that the search engine has taken 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.450
 I do not like whites too much, not the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.549
 white finder that is an accessory 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.069
 like any other it's worth that people do not 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.410
 use it for let's say in quotes 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.840
 to keep as the accessory does not have 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.519
 any blame but already has her 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560
 put that piggy name and that is going to 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.390
 be the look 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 of seeker then white then 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.290
 I prefer to avoid comments and really 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.880
 Well, I do not mind not wearing this type 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.760
 since you did not notice much of the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.080
 difference I do not need a search engine 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.200
 of white as you can see I can do 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.120
 perfectly to the nuclear without money not 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.340
 I want here to show off or hesitate 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.780
 but it is proven that I can do 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.349
 nuclear mineral without white finder 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.880
 and he has little left or is a 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.830
 pretty fast game happened some 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.599
 moments on camera so faster because 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 well you just saw a moment in the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.910
 that the man throws himself down the ravine and 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.340
 I mean, you mean, you give me the whole round 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.739
 I make myself follow you make me follow you to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.720
 end up pulling the ravine I stayed 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.330
 so in plan voucher or champion come 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.799
 you can be good I'm sorry for not 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.660
 have uploaded videos every day 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.250
 I preferred to do other things I was overwhelmed 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.099
 a little bit with the channel and so on since 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.420
 I have received many messages, let's say 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.880
 I needed a couple of days of rest 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.620
 so well I took them and but 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.780
 well we return with more strength than ever 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.160
 as you have not noticed these two days the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.290
 want to upload videos and good here 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.820

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.900
 I liked you and with much more desire 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.090
 to bring you tomorrow another video the truth 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.010

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.570
 this one of a nuclear that tells me with the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.840
 broadcast of playing with a kid of ping 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.010
 ping gaming so good because I already 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.600
 you will see quite well this morning 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.850
 I hope you've liked nuclear 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.200
 so nothing guys here are going to give me 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.609
 the nuclear as soon as I killed this man 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.069
 I took it quite calmly 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.359
 truth must admit so nothing 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.730
 that you liked guys a greeting to 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.260

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.260

 goodbye
