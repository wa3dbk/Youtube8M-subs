so<00:06:56.110> since<00:06:56.320> Carol's<00:06:56.710> Daughter<00:06:56.950> has<00:06:57.220> so<00:06:57.520> many

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
so since Carol's Daughter has so many

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.970 
so since Carol's Daughter has so many
products<00:06:58.150> for<00:06:58.270> curled<00:06:58.600> hair<00:06:58.870> and<00:06:59.110> I<00:06:59.500> felt

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
products for curled hair and I felt

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.250 
products for curled hair and I felt
since<00:07:00.490> I<00:07:00.640> don't<00:07:00.700> have<00:07:00.910> extremely<00:07:01.510> curly<00:07:01.930> hair

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
since I don't have extremely curly hair

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.380 
since I don't have extremely curly hair
and<00:07:02.470> maybe<00:07:02.860> not<00:07:03.220> benefiting<00:07:03.910> from<00:07:04.150> them

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
and maybe not benefiting from them

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.450 
and maybe not benefiting from them
completely<00:07:05.140> because<00:07:05.470> my<00:07:05.590> hair<00:07:05.800> isn't<00:07:05.980> that

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
completely because my hair isn't that

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.550 
completely because my hair isn't that
curly<00:07:06.940> and<00:07:07.000> it's<00:07:07.180> just<00:07:07.330> more<00:07:07.570> of<00:07:07.930> a<00:07:08.260> natural

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
curly and it's just more of a natural

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.740 
curly and it's just more of a natural
wave<00:07:09.160> so<00:07:09.730> I<00:07:09.790> figured<00:07:10.120> I<00:07:10.240> would<00:07:10.390> go<00:07:10.510> ahead<00:07:10.600> and

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
wave so I figured I would go ahead and

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.500 
wave so I figured I would go ahead and
