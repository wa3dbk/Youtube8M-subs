00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.760 
okay I'm going to pull that foam over
the<00:03:56.620> top<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.970> notice<00:03:58.300> if<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.570> just<00:03:58.840> kind<00:03:59.710> of

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
the top and notice if I just kind of

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.680 
the top and notice if I just kind of
leave<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.250> as<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.610> is<00:04:00.640> it'll<00:04:01.360> be<00:04:01.510> fairly<00:04:01.900> bulky

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
leave it as it is it'll be fairly bulky

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.970 
leave it as it is it'll be fairly bulky
so<00:04:04.690> what<00:04:04.840> I'm<00:04:04.900> going<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.080> do<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.380> put<00:04:05.800> some

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
so what I'm going to do is put some

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.500 
so what I'm going to do is put some
tension<00:04:06.400> on<00:04:06.460> that<00:04:06.520> not<00:04:06.880> too<00:04:07.120> much<00:04:07.330> because

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
tension on that not too much because

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.670 
tension on that not too much because
this<00:04:07.690> stuff<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.020> little<00:04:08.110> break

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
this stuff a little break

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.550 
this stuff a little break
pull<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.550> forward<00:04:09.730> with<00:04:10.030> your<00:04:10.150> other<00:04:10.300> hand

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
pull it forward with your other hand

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.970 
pull it forward with your other hand
drop<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.710> bobbin<00:04:12.100> over<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.370> other<00:04:12.490> side<00:04:13.980> give

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
drop the bobbin over the other side give

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.640 
drop the bobbin over the other side give
it<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.190> couple<00:04:15.490> good<00:04:15.640> wraps<00:04:16.109> when<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.170> cut<00:04:17.500> this

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
it a couple good wraps when I cut this

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.190 
it a couple good wraps when I cut this
off<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:18.040> want<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.250> pull<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.549> tight<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.150> clip<00:04:20.049> as

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
off I want to pull it tight and clip as

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.070 
off I want to pull it tight and clip as
close<00:04:20.500> as<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:20.799> can<00:04:21.660> then<00:04:22.660> I'll<00:04:22.780> keep<00:04:22.930> that

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
close as I can then I'll keep that

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.890 
close as I can then I'll keep that
material<00:04:23.620> from<00:04:23.740> crowding<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.580> head<00:04:24.900> I'm

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
material from crowding the head I'm

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.670 
material from crowding the head I'm
going<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.080> take<00:04:26.260> these<00:04:26.440> buyouts<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:28.560> they<00:04:29.560> are

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
going to take these buyouts and they are

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.950 
going to take these buyouts and they are
going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> just<00:04:30.400> go<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.090> edge<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.360> that

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
going to just go on the edge of that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:41.310 
going to just go on the edge of that
foam<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:34.120> I'll<00:04:34.180> put<00:04:34.360> one<00:04:34.660> on<00:04:34.840> one<00:04:34.870> side<00:04:40.320> the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
foam so I'll put one on one side the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:51.360 
foam so I'll put one on one side the
other<00:04:41.530> away<00:04:41.800> from<00:04:42.100> me

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.370 

and<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:52.000> tie<00:04:52.180> these<00:04:52.240> off<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:52.780> like<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.080> reinforce

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
and to tie these off I like to reinforce

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.800 
and to tie these off I like to reinforce
them<00:04:53.770> back<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.010> little<00:04:54.190> bit<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:55.270> so<00:04:55.360> they<00:04:55.570> stay

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
them back a little bit just so they stay

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.300 
them back a little bit just so they stay
locked<00:04:56.020> down<00:04:56.260> so<00:04:57.220> I'll<00:04:57.280> use<00:04:57.460> some<00:04:57.610> thread<00:04:57.940> and

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
locked down so I'll use some thread and

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:12.260 
locked down so I'll use some thread and
tie<00:05:00.310> back<00:05:00.669> over<00:05:01.300> those<00:05:02.199> buttons

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.510 

wit<00:05:13.270> finish<00:05:15.300> go<00:05:16.300> back<00:05:16.680> cut<00:05:17.680> those<00:05:17.890> as<00:05:18.040> close<00:05:18.340> as

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
wit finish go back cut those as close as

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.970 
wit finish go back cut those as close as
I<00:05:18.640> can<00:05:22.980> that's<00:05:23.980> your<00:05:24.190> finished<00:05:24.370> product
