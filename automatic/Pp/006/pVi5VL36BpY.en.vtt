00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
it's call this background test and let's

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.640 
it's call this background test and let's
go<00:00:29.099> okay<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.240> basically<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.439> most

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.889 
effects and elaborate Orioles or a lot
of<00:01:14.310> project<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.850> require<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.329> to<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.509> mass

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
of project will require you to use mass

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.289 
of project will require you to use mass
to<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:17.219> some<00:01:17.399> stuff<00:01:17.609> in<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:17.969> stuff<00:01:18.179> up

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to get some stuff in get some stuff up

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.539 
to get some stuff in get some stuff up
ok<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> click<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.829> Q<00:01:20.070> tool<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
ok so I'm going to click the Q tool and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.760 
ok so I'm going to click the Q tool and
that's<00:01:21.149> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.329> accurate<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:21.869> mask<00:01:22.079> now<00:01:22.679> if

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that's going to accurate the mask now if

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.899 
that's going to accurate the mask now if
you<00:01:22.859> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.039> interchange<00:01:23.280> between<00:01:23.549> mass

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you want to interchange between mass

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.880 
you want to interchange between mass
because<00:01:24.270> default<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:25.079> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.289> have<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
because default you're going to have the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.099 
because default you're going to have the
rectangular<00:01:26.549> mask<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.539> just<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:27.869> kill

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
rectangular mask you just could kill

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.779 
rectangular mask you just could kill
again<00:01:28.170> until<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:29.009> your<00:01:29.130> desired<00:01:29.219> mass

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
again until you get your desired mass

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.380 
again until you get your desired mass
which<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.149> in<00:01:30.719> this<00:01:30.929> case<00:01:31.170> daily<00:01:31.380> lips<00:01:31.649> O'Toole

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
which is in this case daily lips O'Toole

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.649 
which is in this case daily lips O'Toole
okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> nice<00:01:34.229> mask<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
okay so let's like a nice mask and you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.980 
okay so let's like a nice mask and you
go<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> move<00:01:40.139> it<00:01:40.229> around<00:01:40.319> and<00:01:40.619> edit<00:01:40.859> it<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
go is move it around and edit it and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.980 
go is move it around and edit it and
let's<00:01:42.990> invert<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.710> mask<00:01:44.359> so<00:01:45.359> now<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.600> dark

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
let's invert this mask so now the dark

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.379 
let's invert this mask so now the dark
is<00:01:46.109> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.319> outside<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.039> now<00:01:47.149> let's<00:01:48.149> feather

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
is on the outside and now let's feather

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.169 
is on the outside and now let's feather
it<00:01:48.630> by<00:01:48.749> clicking<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.200> small<00:01:49.350> arrow<00:01:49.679> and

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
it by clicking the small arrow and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.779 
it by clicking the small arrow and
increasing<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.329> amount<00:01:51.600> feather<00:01:52.789> this

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
increasing the amount feather this

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.639 
increasing the amount feather this
allows<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> fade<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:55.139> I<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
allows you to fade in now I don't have a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.010 
allows you to fade in now I don't have a
strong<00:01:56.069> gradient<00:01:56.639> but<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.060> still<00:01:57.539> adds<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
strong gradient but it still adds a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.859 
strong gradient but it still adds a
little<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.350> than<00:01:58.590> nice<00:01:58.799> touch<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.429> my<00:01:59.549> blue

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
little bit than nice touch to my blue

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
little bit than nice touch to my blue
okay<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:00.929> this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.679> method<00:02:01.889> now<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
okay so this is just one method now I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.550 
okay so this is just one method now I
could<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.119> add<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> nice<00:02:03.869> texture<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> the
