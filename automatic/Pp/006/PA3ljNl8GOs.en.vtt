00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you've got the Karaka bun here and I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.960 
you've got the Karaka bun here and I
wish<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.620> could<00:02:17.770> break<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.520> but<00:02:18.670> we'll<00:02:18.820> do

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
wish I could break into it but we'll do

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.110 
wish I could break into it but we'll do
that<00:02:19.090> with<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.390> bite<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.600> guess<00:02:21.120> underneath

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that with the bite I guess underneath

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.420 
that with the bite I guess underneath
just<00:02:22.480> looks<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.870> mayo<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.260> lettuce<00:02:23.860> which

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
just looks like mayo and lettuce which

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.060 
just looks like mayo and lettuce which
if<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.420> order<00:02:25.750> kind<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.050> like<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> tonkatsu<00:02:26.500> or

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
if you order kind of like a tonkatsu or

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.550 
if you order kind of like a tonkatsu or
cut<00:02:27.280> okay<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.510> most<00:02:28.960> of<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.230> time<00:02:29.410> you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560

that's a little bit of an improvement so

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.810 
that's a little bit of an improvement so
it's<00:03:34.740> just<00:03:34.920> kind<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.190> sauce<00:03:35.459> on<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.790> inside

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
it's just kind of sauce on the inside

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.090 
it's just kind of sauce on the inside
which<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.570> me<00:03:36.720> kind<00:03:36.990> of<00:03:37.110> doesn't<00:03:37.290> feel<00:03:37.440> filling

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
which to me kind of doesn't feel filling

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.729 
which to me kind of doesn't feel filling
if<00:03:38.520> it<00:03:38.700> was<00:03:38.850> potato<00:03:39.240> on<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.600> inside<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.350> would

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
if it was potato on the inside I would

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.130 
if it was potato on the inside I would
feel<00:03:40.950> quite<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.510> was<00:03:42.630> filling<00:03:42.989> but

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
feel quite I think it was filling but

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.530 
feel quite I think it was filling but
it's<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.530> kind<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.800> like<00:03:43.890> creamy<00:03:44.340> sauce<00:03:44.730> when

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it's just kind of like creamy sauce when

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.680 
it's just kind of like creamy sauce when
you<00:03:45.630> get<00:03:45.810> gratin<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.440> has<00:03:47.090> pasta<00:03:48.090> inside<00:03:48.480> which

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you get gratin it has pasta inside which

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.090 
you get gratin it has pasta inside which
is<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.959> filler<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.410> maybe<00:03:49.620> there's<00:03:49.920> some

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
is the filler so maybe there's some

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.410 
is the filler so maybe there's some
pasta<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.580> here

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.000 

it's<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:58.110> there<00:03:58.590> that's<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> sauce

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.630

this<00:04:14.280> stuff<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.640> frozen<00:04:15.169> it's<00:04:16.169> not<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.760> whole

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
this stuff in frozen it's not a whole

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.949 
this stuff in frozen it's not a whole
sin<00:04:18.030> which<00:04:18.180> would<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.389> bite<00:04:18.540> into<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.780> with

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
sin which would you bite into it with

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.449 
sin which would you bite into it with
the<00:04:19.079> mayonnaise<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.100> bread<00:04:20.310> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
the mayonnaise and with the bread and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.700 
the mayonnaise and with the bread and
everything<00:04:20.790> it's<00:04:21.120> quite<00:04:21.269> good<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.380> I

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
everything it's quite good it's like I

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.240 
everything it's quite good it's like I
think<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.580> kind<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.730> Awesome<00:04:23.910> tasting<00:04:24.540> but

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
think it's kind of Awesome tasting but

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
think it's kind of Awesome tasting but
just<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.370> sauce<00:04:26.610> alone<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:27.240> kind<00:04:27.450> of

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
just the sauce alone it's kind of

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.220 
just the sauce alone it's kind of
there's<00:04:30.270> nothing<00:04:30.360> going<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.840> there<00:04:31.080> and

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
there's nothing going on there and

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.960 
there's nothing going on there and
that's<00:04:31.350> how<00:04:31.740> gratin<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.250> usually<00:04:32.760> when<00:04:32.880> you

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
that's how gratin is usually when you

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.360 
that's how gratin is usually when you
get<00:04:33.120> gratin<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.660> it's<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.680> whole<00:04:34.830> blend<00:04:35.160> of

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
get gratin it it's the whole blend of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.010 
get gratin it it's the whole blend of
the<00:04:35.490> cheese<00:04:35.760> and

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.830 

the<00:04:41.470> cheese<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.070> pasta<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.090> sauce<00:04:43.120> I

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
the cheese and the pasta and the sauce I

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.170 
the cheese and the pasta and the sauce I
want<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.380> see<00:04:44.530> if<00:04:44.620> it'd<00:04:44.740> be<00:04:44.860> okay<00:04:45.400> with<00:04:45.610> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
want to see if it'd be okay with the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.360 
want to see if it'd be okay with the
cheese<00:04:46.420> one<00:04:46.660> besides<00:04:46.990> now<00:04:47.890> that<00:04:48.070> we've<00:04:48.190> had

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
cheese one besides now that we've had

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.100 
cheese one besides now that we've had
that<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.610> think<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.000> cheese<00:04:49.210> probably<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.900> the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that I think the cheese probably is the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.810 
that I think the cheese probably is the
way<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.290> go<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.770> gives<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.280> little<00:04:51.370> more<00:04:51.520> kick

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
way to go it gives it a little more kick

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.090 
way to go it gives it a little more kick
of<00:04:52.000> flavor<00:04:52.030> I'm<00:04:52.480> assuming<00:04:52.960> yeah<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:54.040> think

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
of flavor I'm assuming yeah so I think

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.390 
of flavor I'm assuming yeah so I think
this<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.670> identical<00:04:55.560> yep<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.860> little<00:04:57.160> more

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
this is identical yep a little more

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.390 
this is identical yep a little more
sauce<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.910> looks<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.390> lot<00:04:58.660> more<00:04:58.900> sauce

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
sauce it looks it's a lot more sauce

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.610 
sauce it looks it's a lot more sauce
because<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.490> didn't<00:05:00.670> soak<00:05:00.940> into<00:05:01.150> me<00:05:01.480> yeah<00:05:01.660> but

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
because it didn't soak into me yeah but

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.840
