are under 50 bucks down from 150 their
waterproof<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.229> weatherproof<00:01:46.590> they've

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
waterproof and weatherproof they've

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.400 
waterproof and weatherproof they've
never<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.310> sold<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:47.940> price<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.479> high<00:01:49.229> as

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
never really sold for a price as high as

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.320 
never really sold for a price as high as
150<00:01:49.979> they<00:01:50.100> usually<00:01:50.340> retail<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.729> 80<00:01:51.060> when

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
150 they usually retail about 80 when

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.840 
150 they usually retail about 80 when
Amazon<00:01:51.780> has<00:01:52.440> them<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.770> sale<00:01:52.830> they're<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.460> 60

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
Amazon has them on sale they're like 60

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.560 
Amazon has them on sale they're like 60
bucks<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.330> they're<00:01:54.570> never<00:01:55.220> under<00:01:56.220> 50<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:57.300> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bucks but they're never under 50 so this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
bucks but they're never under 50 so this
is<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.110> system<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.530> why<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> think<00:01:59.310> it's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
is the system and why I think it's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
is the system and why I think it's
special<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> has<00:01:59.910> two<00:02:00.240> adjustable<00:02:00.600> motion

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
special it has two adjustable motion

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.320 
special it has two adjustable motion
sensors<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.190> detect<00:02:02.789> different

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
sensors so you can detect different

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.389 
sensors so you can detect different
areas<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.410> property<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
areas of your property if you see you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.279 
areas of your property if you see you
can<00:02:05.550> turn<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:05.970> one<00:02:06.360> pointing<00:02:06.930> toward<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
can turn them one pointing toward this

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.600 
can turn them one pointing toward this
way<00:02:07.470> one<00:02:07.649> pointing<00:02:08.009> another<00:02:08.220> way<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.399> that's

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
way one pointing another way so that's

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.300 
way one pointing another way so that's
significant<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.869> also<00:02:09.989> four<00:02:10.649> LEDs

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
significant there are also four LEDs

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
significant there are also four LEDs
that's<00:02:11.850> significant<00:02:12.480> because<00:02:12.570> many<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.930> these

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
that's significant because many of these

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.830 
that's significant because many of these
systems<00:02:14.220> usually<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.940> LED<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> four<00:02:15.810> I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
systems usually have one LED the four I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.930 
systems usually have one LED the four I
think<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> pivotal<00:02:17.340> point<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.700> what<00:02:17.790> makes

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
think is a pivotal point of what makes

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.270 
think is a pivotal point of what makes
this<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.209> great<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.420> did<00:02:18.690> see<00:02:18.840> some<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:20.070> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this so great I did see some not so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
this so great I did see some not so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
fantastic reviews of an earlier version

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.080 
fantastic reviews of an earlier version
of<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.680> system<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.489> tested<00:02:23.940> we

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
of this system the one that I tested we

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.640 
of this system the one that I tested we
tested<00:02:24.420> four<00:02:24.720> different<00:02:25.140> ones<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.500> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
tested four different ones from this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430 
tested four different ones from this
batch<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.549> performed<00:02:27.209> great<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:28.019> come<00:02:28.290> with

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
batch all performed great they come with

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.570 
batch all performed great they come with
the<00:02:28.530> remote<00:02:28.799> control<00:02:29.190> which<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.459> actually

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the remote control which I actually

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
the remote control which I actually
think<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.000> great<00:02:30.239> point<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
think is a great point and it's the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.979 
think is a great point and it's the
equivalent<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.799> 75<00:02:32.489> watt<00:02:32.519> LED<00:02:33.330> halogen<00:02:33.810> bulb

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
equivalent of a 75 watt LED halogen bulb

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.710 
equivalent of a 75 watt LED halogen bulb
so<00:02:34.769> that's<00:02:34.950> awesome<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:36.090> want<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.330> grab<00:02:36.510> this
