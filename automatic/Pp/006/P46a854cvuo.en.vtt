was<00:01:13.550> working<00:01:13.850> on<00:01:13.940> when<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.420> was<00:01:14.600> sick<00:01:14.899> one<00:01:15.530> of

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
was working on when I was sick one of

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.660 
was working on when I was sick one of
the<00:01:15.710> things<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.100> find<00:01:16.369> really

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the things that I find really

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
the things that I find really
interesting<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:18.440> human<00:01:19.160> behavior<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:20.420> you

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
interesting is human behavior if you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.170 
interesting is human behavior if you
have<00:01:21.170> taken<00:01:21.590> psychology<00:01:22.190> or<00:01:22.460> if<00:01:22.940> you're

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
have taken psychology or if you're

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.420 
have taken psychology or if you're
interested<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.720> psychology<00:01:24.020> then<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.310> would

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
interested in psychology then you would

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.780 
interested in psychology then you would
likely<00:01:25.670> bump<00:01:26.210> into<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.690> iceberg<00:01:27.080> example<00:01:28.070> to

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
likely bump into the iceberg example to

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.260 
likely bump into the iceberg example to
kind<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.200> explore<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.470> human<00:01:30.799> behavior<00:01:31.280> what

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
kind of explore the human behavior what

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.590 
kind of explore the human behavior what
I<00:01:32.299> have<00:01:32.479> first<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.350> all<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.940> this<00:01:34.940> shape<00:01:35.360> it's

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
let's see let's put a boat there for me

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.740

the iceberg and you'll find that you can
see<00:01:59.180> 10%<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.110> iceberg<00:02:00.590> whereas<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.270> rest

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
see 10% of the iceberg whereas the rest

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.359 
see 10% of the iceberg whereas the rest
of<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.750> iceberg<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.500> do<00:02:03.710> not<00:02:03.830> see<00:02:04.130> is

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
of the iceberg that you do not see is

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.240 
of the iceberg that you do not see is
actually<00:02:05.000> about<00:02:05.240> 90%<00:02:06.080> so<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.770> majority<00:02:07.070> of

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
actually about 90% so the majority of

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.600 
actually about 90% so the majority of
the<00:02:07.490> iceberg<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.450> actually<00:02:08.840> hidden<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
the iceberg is actually hidden the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.850 
the iceberg is actually hidden the
basics<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.269> what<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.660> iceberg<00:02:12.049> represents<00:02:12.709> is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
basics of what the iceberg represents is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.970 
basics of what the iceberg represents is
that<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:14.209> show<00:02:14.510> only<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> fraction<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
that we show only a fraction of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.940 
that we show only a fraction of
ourselves<00:02:16.519> in<00:02:17.030> our<00:02:17.360> daily<00:02:17.420> lives<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.799> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
ourselves in our daily lives so it's the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.100 
ourselves in our daily lives so it's the
way<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.370> present<00:02:19.549> ourselves<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
way that we present ourselves it's the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.539 
way that we present ourselves it's the
way<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.470> dress<00:02:21.650> it's<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> way<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.489> we

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
way that we dress it's the way that we

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.690 
way that we dress it's the way that we
act<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.150> that's<00:02:23.900> kind<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:25.100> tip<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
act and that's kind of the tip of the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.330 
act and that's kind of the tip of the
iceberg<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.360> our<00:02:26.540> personality<00:02:27.260> an<00:02:27.470> example

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
iceberg of our personality an example

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
that I'm going to use is something that

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.440 
that I'm going to use is something that
I've<00:02:30.470> experienced<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.190> my<00:02:31.280> life<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.850> that's

I've experienced in my life and that's

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.720 
I've experienced in my life and that's
difficulty<00:02:33.320> accepting<00:02:33.980> compliments<00:02:34.340> now

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
difficulty accepting compliments now

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.360 
difficulty accepting compliments now

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
it's taken me quite a few years to come

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.420 
it's taken me quite a few years to come
to<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> point<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:38.380> actually<00:02:39.380> fully<00:02:39.709> accept

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
so what often happened was that if

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.610 
so what often happened was that if
somebody<00:02:56.209> would<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.420> say<00:02:56.659> oh<00:02:56.840> he<00:02:57.290> did<00:02:57.409> a<00:02:57.500> good

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
on that project

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.789 
on that project
then<00:03:01.310> I'd<00:03:01.760> shrug<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.329> off<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.510> say<00:03:02.870> yeah<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.620> was

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
then I'd shrug it off and say yeah I was

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.410 
then I'd shrug it off and say yeah I was
okay<00:03:04.159> I<00:03:04.189> could<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.819> done<00:03:04.879> better<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.299> these

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
okay I could have done better in these

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.809 
okay I could have done better in these
areas<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.260> don't<00:03:06.620> really<00:03:06.769> fully<00:03:07.099> accept<00:03:07.670> a

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
areas so I don't really fully accept a

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.970 
areas so I don't really fully accept a
compliment<00:03:08.329> from<00:03:08.689> another<00:03:08.959> person<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:09.500> I

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
kind of down a down play anything that

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.069 
kind of down a down play anything that
I've<00:03:12.500> done<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:13.940> always<00:03:14.299> great<00:03:14.810> to

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
I've done now it's it's always great to

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.170 
I've done now it's it's always great to
be<00:03:15.109> critical<00:03:15.709> for<00:03:16.250> your<00:03:16.400> work<00:03:16.579> so<00:03:16.609> that<00:03:16.879> you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
be critical for your work so that you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.270 
be critical for your work so that you
can<00:03:17.329> improve<00:03:17.690> yourself<00:03:18.230> but<00:03:18.889> when<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.129> comes

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
can improve yourself but when it comes

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.520 
can improve yourself but when it comes
to<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> point<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:20.019> rejecting<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.139> person's

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
to a point of rejecting a person's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.740 
to a point of rejecting a person's
compliment<00:03:22.159> because<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:23.569> feel

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
compliment because you feel

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.369 
compliment because you feel
uncomfortable<00:03:24.470> then<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.220> becomes<00:03:26.379> that

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
uncomfortable then that becomes that

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.199 
uncomfortable then that becomes that
could<00:03:27.680> become<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.310> problem<00:03:28.579> what<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.030> was

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
could become a problem what I was

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.360 
could become a problem what I was
showing<00:03:29.480> was<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:30.139> was<00:03:30.370> difficulty

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
showing was that I was difficulty

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.490 
showing was that I was difficulty
accepting<00:03:31.849> compliments<00:03:32.319> some<00:03:33.319> of<00:03:33.439> the

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
accepting compliments some of the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.129 
accepting compliments some of the
reasons<00:03:33.950> why<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.939> could<00:03:35.150> be<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.540> reason<00:03:35.870> of

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
reasons why is it could be the reason of

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.149 
reasons why is it could be the reason of
a<00:03:36.319> fear<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.590> failure

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
a fear of failure

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.460 
a fear of failure
it's<00:03:37.849> kind<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.659> whole<00:03:38.810> aspect<00:03:39.319> of

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
it's kind of like the whole aspect of

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.649 
it's kind of like the whole aspect of
having<00:03:39.980> lower<00:03:40.370> expectations<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:41.510> you're

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
having lower expectations so you're

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.309 
having lower expectations so you're
never<00:03:42.109> disappointed<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:44.000> that's<00:03:44.930> where<00:03:45.139> fear

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
never disappointed and that's where fear

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.710 
never disappointed and that's where fear
the<00:03:45.440> fear<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.769> failure<00:03:46.010> comes<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.609> so<00:03:47.510> another

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the fear of failure comes in so another

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.970 
the fear of failure comes in so another
common<00:03:47.989> thing<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.769> I've<00:03:49.010> found<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.760> fear<00:03:50.389> of

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
common thing that I've found the fear of

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.610 
common thing that I've found the fear of
seeming<00:03:52.209> egotistical<00:03:53.209> if<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:54.049> friend<00:03:54.319> were<00:03:54.470> to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
seeming egotistical if a friend were to

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
can be proud of that so there is that

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.240 
can be proud of that so there is that
fear<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.479> what<00:04:30.110> will<00:04:30.199> people<00:04:30.320> think<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.889> then

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
fear of what will people think and then

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.649 
fear of what will people think and then
the<00:04:31.370> other<00:04:31.520> one<00:04:31.729> another<00:04:32.000> example<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.630> I

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
the other one another example that I

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.810 
the other one another example that I
would<00:04:32.840> use<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.770> accepting<00:04:34.520> compliments

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
would use is that accepting compliments

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.080 
would use is that accepting compliments
will<00:04:35.330> equal<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.409> accepting<00:04:37.010> my<00:04:37.159> best<00:04:37.430> what<00:04:38.060> I

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
will equal to accepting my best what I

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.120 
will equal to accepting my best what I
mean<00:04:38.330> by<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.380> if<00:04:39.620> somebody<00:04:39.979> were<00:04:40.070> to

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
mean by that is that if somebody were to

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.879 
mean by that is that if somebody were to
say<00:04:40.310> oh<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.669> project<00:04:41.360> was<00:04:41.510> great<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.080> I

say oh that project was great and I
would<00:04:42.949> accept<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.760> then<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.539> fear<00:04:44.840> or<00:04:45.169> what

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
would accept it then the fear or what

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.250 
would accept it then the fear or what
what<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.099> might<00:04:46.310> think<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:47.150> oh<00:04:47.360> they<00:04:48.020> think

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
what I might think is that oh they think

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.070 
what I might think is that oh they think
that's<00:04:48.469> the<00:04:48.710> best<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.099> can<00:04:49.159> do<00:04:49.460> so<00:04:50.210> where<00:04:50.779> is<00:04:50.900> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.280 
understand where a person's behavior
stems<00:05:04.010> from<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:05.360> more<00:05:05.600> we<00:05:05.870> can<00:05:06.020> further

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
stems from the more we can further

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.890 
stems from the more we can further
accept<00:05:06.920> and<00:05:07.130> respect<00:05:08.000> others<00:05:08.420> for<00:05:08.780> their

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
complete opposite it doesn't mean that

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
coming from it's a matter of perspective

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.830 
coming from it's a matter of perspective
so<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.920> come<00:05:31.100> across<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.430> situation<00:05:31.840> where

you don't agree with but whether you

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.400 
you don't agree with but whether you
know<00:05:36.740> them<00:05:36.890> or<00:05:36.980> not<00:05:37.480> it<00:05:38.480> can<00:05:38.600> be<00:05:38.720> very<00:05:38.900> easy<00:05:39.170> to

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
know them or not it can be very easy to

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.370 
know them or not it can be very easy to
say<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.890> person<00:05:40.400> is<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.640> bad<00:05:40.880> person<00:05:41.110> but<00:05:42.110> just

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.760 
say that person is a bad person but just
consider<00:05:42.820> why<00:05:43.840> you<00:05:44.840> think<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.290> person<00:05:45.650> is<00:05:45.680> a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
consider why you think that person is a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.310 
consider why you think that person is a
bad<00:05:45.890> person<00:05:45.950> and<00:05:46.430> why<00:05:46.760> they<00:05:47.030> actually<00:05:47.450> did<00:05:47.690> did

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
bad person and why they actually did did

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.490 
bad person and why they actually did did
those<00:05:48.500> things<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:48.950> think<00:05:49.280> that<00:05:49.900> we<00:05:50.900> can't<00:05:51.140> just

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
those things I think that we can't just

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.560 
those things I think that we can't just
put<00:05:51.680> a<00:05:51.710> band-aid<00:05:52.160> over<00:05:52.340> problems<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:53.300> solve

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
put a band-aid over problems to solve

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.400 
put a band-aid over problems to solve
them<00:05:53.810> for<00:05:54.020> example<00:05:54.980> if<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:56.630> were<00:05:56.840> to<00:05:56.990> be<00:05:57.080> stabbed

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
them for example if I were to be stabbed

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.010 
them for example if I were to be stabbed
in<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.650> stomach<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.910> was<00:05:59.030> bleeding<00:05:59.540> you

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
in the stomach and I was bleeding you

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.510 
in the stomach and I was bleeding you
could<00:06:00.140> easily<00:06:00.350> put<00:06:00.620> a<00:06:00.680> band-aid<00:06:01.070> over<00:06:01.220> top

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
could easily put a band-aid over top

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.310 
could easily put a band-aid over top
that's<00:06:01.850> not<00:06:02.060> really<00:06:02.270> gonna<00:06:02.390> fix<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.870> problem

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
that's not really gonna fix the problem

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.500 
that's not really gonna fix the problem
what<00:06:03.740> you<00:06:04.430> need<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.700> do<00:06:04.850> is<00:06:05.060> actually<00:06:05.270> go

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
what you need to do is actually go

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.240 
what you need to do is actually go
inside<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:06.170> see<00:06:06.470> where<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.830> bleeding<00:06:07.130> is

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
inside and see where the bleeding is

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.970 
inside and see where the bleeding is
coming<00:06:07.430> from<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:08.180> then<00:06:08.930> deal<00:06:09.500> with<00:06:09.530> it<00:06:09.860> from

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
coming from and then deal with it from

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.280 
coming from and then deal with it from
the<00:06:10.130> inside<00:06:10.490> out<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:11.000> that's<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.780> same<00:06:11.990> with

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
the inside out and that's the same with

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.860 
the inside out and that's the same with
social<00:06:12.890> behavior<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:14.150> can't<00:06:14.390> just<00:06:14.660> put<00:06:14.840> a

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
social behavior you can't just put a

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.250 
social behavior you can't just put a
blanket<00:06:15.380> judgment<00:06:15.980> and<00:06:16.190> blanket<00:06:17.150> a<00:06:17.330> solution

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
blanket judgment and blanket a solution

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.130 
blanket judgment and blanket a solution
over<00:06:18.770> any<00:06:19.100> issue<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:20.030> really<00:06:20.690> kind<00:06:20.870> of<00:06:20.930> have

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
over any issue you really kind of have

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.580 
over any issue you really kind of have
to<00:06:21.290> go<00:06:21.440> in<00:06:21.620> in<00:06:21.950> deeper<00:06:22.640> and<00:06:22.790> ask<00:06:23.390> what<00:06:24.380> are<00:06:24.410> the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
to go in in deeper and ask what are the

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.610 
to go in in deeper and ask what are the
core<00:06:24.830> reasons<00:06:25.340> why<00:06:25.460> a<00:06:26.090> person<00:06:26.240> chooses<00:06:27.230> to<00:06:27.440> do

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
core reasons why a person chooses to do

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.160 
core reasons why a person chooses to do
what<00:06:27.830> they<00:06:27.950> do<00:06:28.120> otherwise<00:06:29.120> we're<00:06:29.600> just<00:06:29.630> going

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
what they do otherwise we're just going

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.820 
what they do otherwise we're just going
to<00:06:30.290> go<00:06:30.410> through<00:06:30.440> a<00:06:30.680> cycle<00:06:30.950> of<00:06:31.810> behavior

band-aid<00:06:33.830> behavior<00:06:34.370> band-aid<00:06:34.820> and<00:06:35.860> it

band-aid behavior band-aid and it

band-aid behavior band-aid and it
doesn't<00:06:37.130> really<00:06:37.250> solve<00:06:37.520> anything
