can find in the NQ chamber I wanna start
by<00:00:12.160> showing<00:00:12.520> you<00:00:12.730> this<00:00:13.059> model

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.800 

here<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.800> projector<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> light<00:00:29.759> is<00:00:30.449> not

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
here this a projector and light is not

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.910 
here this a projector and light is not
visible<00:00:31.230> unless<00:00:31.919> you<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:32.850> smoke<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
visible unless you get some smoke in the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.750 
visible unless you get some smoke in the
path<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.520> light<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.550> can

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
path of this light you see here you can

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
path of this light you see here you can
see<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> passage<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.809> light<00:00:43.019> when<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
see the passage of the light when the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.790 
see the passage of the light when the
smoke<00:00:43.830> is<00:00:44.040> present

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.770 

this<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.950> because<00:00:52.340> smoke<00:00:52.730> scatter<00:00:53.150> back<00:00:53.540> the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
this is because smoke scatter back the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.740 
this is because smoke scatter back the
light<00:00:53.990> when<00:00:54.560> there<00:00:54.740> is<00:00:54.830> no<00:00:55.040> smoke<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.580> air<00:00:55.820> the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
light when there is no smoke and air the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.870 
light when there is no smoke and air the
light<00:00:56.960> passes<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:57.650> affected<00:00:58.400> but<00:00:58.610> when

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
light passes and affected but when

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.200 
light passes and affected but when
smokes<00:00:59.300> or<00:00:59.600> dust<00:00:59.990> is<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.710> way<00:01:00.970> light<00:01:01.970> is

smokes or dust is in the way light is

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.570 
smokes or dust is in the way light is
scattered<00:01:02.450> and<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:03.380> can<00:01:03.620> see<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.040> passage<00:01:04.430> of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
scattered and we can see the passage of

the maximum then we'll start to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.540 
the maximum then we'll start to

to<00:01:35.030> improve<00:01:35.509> our<00:01:35.720> visibility<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:37.190> can<00:01:37.460> move

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
to improve our visibility we can move

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.660 
to improve our visibility we can move
the<00:01:38.030> location<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.380> light<00:01:39.590> from<00:01:40.369> side<00:01:40.640> to

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
the state lab slightly up and down so we

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.880 
the state lab slightly up and down so we
examine<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.360> wider<00:01:53.570> area<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.290> a<00:01:54.380> short<00:01:54.620> time

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
examine a wider area and a short time

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.830 
examine a wider area and a short time
and<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.670> brain<00:01:55.909> we<00:01:56.150> can<00:01:56.330> collect<00:01:56.750> data

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
and in the brain we can collect data

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.569 
and in the brain we can collect data
more

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.370 

it's<00:02:03.579> always<00:02:03.759> recommended<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.689> see<00:02:05.109> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
it's always recommended to see the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.919 
it's always recommended to see the
echoes<00:02:05.979> flare<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:06.789> lower<00:02:06.969> part<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.659> the

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
echoes flare in the lower part of the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.020 
echoes flare in the lower part of the
antechamber<00:02:10.830> avoiding<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.980> papillary<00:02:12.430> area

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
antechamber avoiding the papillary area

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.440 
antechamber avoiding the papillary area
but<00:02:13.860> personally<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.890> found<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.489> more<00:02:15.700> easy<00:02:16.060> to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
but personally I found it more easy to

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.009 
but personally I found it more easy to
see<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.319> flare<00:02:18.390> opposite<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> papillary

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
see the flare opposite the papillary

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.729 
see the flare opposite the papillary
area<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:21.610> were<00:02:21.670> recommending<00:02:22.510> not

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
area they were recommending not

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.309 
area they were recommending not
examining<00:02:23.739> in<00:02:23.920> front<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.519> pupil<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.319> avoid

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
examining in front of the pupil to avoid

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.130 
examining in front of the pupil to avoid
the<00:02:26.650> appearance<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.670> lens<00:02:27.879> flare<00:02:28.420> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the appearance of the lens flare that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.080 
the appearance of the lens flare that
may<00:02:30.510> disturb<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:32.080> make<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:33.580> wrong

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
may disturb you or make you get a wrong

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.000 
may disturb you or make you get a wrong
impression<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.500> cause<00:02:35.709> flare

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
impression that there is a cause flare

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.300 
impression that there is a cause flare
but<00:02:36.549> actually<00:02:37.239> as<00:02:37.599> I<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:38.260> tell<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.799> were<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
but actually as I can tell it were the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.220 
but actually as I can tell it were the
antechamber<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.269> were<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> balance<00:02:40.989> and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
antechamber and were a balance and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.319 
antechamber and were a balance and
personally<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.130> always<00:02:42.160> search<00:02:42.880> for<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
personally I always search for the

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:54.720 
personally I always search for the
echoes<00:02:43.690> flare<00:02:44.019> in<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.980> papillary<00:02:45.459> area

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.360 

it<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.880> important<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.870> follow-up<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.890> cases

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
it is important for follow-up of cases

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.260 
it is important for follow-up of cases
to<00:02:58.640> use<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:59.209> same<00:02:59.480> length<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.130> same

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
to use the same length and the same

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.110 
to use the same length and the same
width<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.840> beam<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.530> example<00:03:07.120> you

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
width of the beam in this example you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.860 
width of the beam in this example you
can<00:03:08.330> see<00:03:08.569> here<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.900> section<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.739> cornea<00:03:10.870> you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
can see here a section in the cornea you

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.620 
can see here a section in the cornea you
see<00:03:12.140> light<00:03:13.010> hair<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.430> coming<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.030> an<00:03:14.180> angle

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
see light hair is coming with an angle

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.339 
see light hair is coming with an angle
so<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.560> section<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.480> widen<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:18.080> see

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
so the section is widen and you can see

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.280 
so the section is widen and you can see
more<00:03:18.860> details<00:03:19.400> here<00:03:19.849> it's<00:03:20.090> aimed<00:03:20.390> on<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.050> this

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
more details here it's aimed on so this

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.559 
more details here it's aimed on so this
section<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.920> cornea<00:03:22.400> looks<00:03:22.430> very<00:03:22.880> thin<00:03:22.970> and

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
section the cornea looks very thin and

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.110 
section the cornea looks very thin and
as<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.410> notice<00:03:24.769> here<00:03:25.220> there<00:03:25.849> are<00:03:25.940> some

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
as you notice here there are some

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.750 
as you notice here there are some
elevation<00:03:26.840> on<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.019> surface<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.950> iris<00:03:28.370> not

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
elevation on the surface of the iris not

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.570 
elevation on the surface of the iris not
visible<00:03:29.239> here<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.530> keep<00:03:30.799> in<00:03:30.950> mind<00:03:31.220> all<00:03:31.519> the

visible here so keep in mind all the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.539 
visible here so keep in mind all the
time<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.450> bring<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.110> light<00:03:33.319> from<00:03:33.860> an<00:03:34.069> angle

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
time to bring the light from an angle

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.270 
time to bring the light from an angle
and<00:03:34.760> special<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.450> be<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> wide<00:03:35.900> angle<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:37.010> will

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
and special to be a wide angle this will

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.069 
and special to be a wide angle this will
give<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.730> better<00:03:38.890> perform<00:03:39.890> a<00:03:40.010> shoe
