00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.729 
illness in them all right so would you
say<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.909> you<00:01:01.269> played<00:01:01.569> the<00:01:01.780> character<00:01:01.929> or<00:01:02.499> do

you become the character I play the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.430 
you become the character I play the
character

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
character

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.740 
character
well<00:01:06.070> sure<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.580> don't<00:01:06.850> believe<00:01:07.060> anybody<00:01:07.329> says

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
well sure I don't believe anybody says

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.060 
well sure I don't believe anybody says
they<00:01:07.869> become<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.350> be<00:01:08.409> honest<00:01:08.649> with<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
they become it to be honest with you and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.319 
they become it to be honest with you and
believe<00:01:09.189> it<00:01:09.430> for<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.579> second

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
believe it for a second

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.819 
believe it for a second
so<00:01:10.659> would<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.840> categorize<00:01:11.229> yourself<00:01:11.469> as<00:01:11.799> a

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
so would you categorize yourself as a

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.630 
so would you categorize yourself as a
method<00:01:12.219> actor<00:01:12.610> no<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:14.229> think<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.860> every<00:01:15.070> actor

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
method actor no I think that every actor

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.039 
method actor no I think that every actor
what<00:01:15.969> I<00:01:16.000> always<00:01:16.149> said<00:01:16.479> but<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:16.630> says<00:01:16.869> that

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
what I always said but that says that

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.719 
what I always said but that says that
every<00:01:17.259> act<00:01:17.439> has<00:01:17.619> got<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.799> little<00:01:17.979> method<00:01:18.219> and

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
every act has got a little method and

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.330 
every act has got a little method and
that's<00:01:19.420> cool<00:01:19.719> and<00:01:20.020> if<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.860> works<00:01:21.039> for<00:01:21.219> them

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
that's cool and if it works for them

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.789 
that's cool and if it works for them
that's<00:01:21.640> fine<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:22.180> mean<00:01:22.360> some<00:01:22.990> people<00:01:23.259> take<00:01:23.469> it's

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
that's fine I mean some people take it's

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.560 
that's fine I mean some people take it's
but<00:01:24.009> it's<00:01:24.189> all<00:01:24.280> about<00:01:24.460> research<00:01:24.759> actually<00:01:25.210> you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
but it's all about research actually you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.389 
but it's all about research actually you
know<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.469> some<00:01:26.890> actors<00:01:27.189> take

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
know and if you some actors take

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.630 
know and if you some actors take
research<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:28.119> a<00:01:29.020> different<00:01:29.439> place

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
research to a different place

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.080 
research to a different place
I<00:01:32.219> used<00:01:33.219> to<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.750> really<00:01:35.109> really<00:01:35.350> subtly<00:01:35.710> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I used to it's really really subtly and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.730 
I used to it's really really subtly and
nobody's<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:37.600> more<00:01:37.869> difficult<00:01:38.079> for<00:01:38.590> me

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
nobody's it's more difficult for me

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.219 
nobody's it's more difficult for me
because<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.549> can<00:01:39.939> t<00:01:40.030> really<00:01:40.119> good<00:01:40.450> tip<00:01:40.719> pops<00:01:40.930> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
because I can t really good tip pops and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.859 
because I can t really good tip pops and
you<00:01:41.890> know<00:01:42.280> bars<00:01:42.609> or<00:01:42.850> whatever<00:01:42.909> I'm<00:01:43.180> gonna<00:01:43.359> see

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
you know bars or whatever I'm gonna see

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.090 
you know bars or whatever I'm gonna see
the<00:01:43.990> sort<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.229> people<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.500> want<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.710> look<00:01:44.890> at

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
the sort of people I want to look at

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.919 
the sort of people I want to look at
with<00:01:45.399> it<00:01:45.579> been<00:01:45.759> there<00:01:46.390> watched<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.280> observer

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
with it been there watched the observer

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.870 
with it been there watched the observer
became<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.079> observed<00:01:50.409> in<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:51.039> end<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.700> that's

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
became the observed in the end so that's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.160 
became the observed in the end so that's
the<00:01:52.030> kind<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.270> that's<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> been<00:01:52.750> in<00:01:52.899> my<00:01:52.990> life

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
the kind of that's the been in my life

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.870 
the kind of that's the been in my life
but<00:01:53.469> so<00:01:53.740> most<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.009> my<00:01:54.100> research<00:01:54.250> in<00:01:54.549> other<00:01:54.640> days

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
but so most of my research in other days

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.569 
but so most of my research in other days
is<00:01:55.060> through<00:01:55.450> literature<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.560> videotapes<00:01:57.460> and

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
is through literature and videotapes and

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.450 
is through literature and videotapes and
stuff<00:01:57.820> like<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.590> still<00:01:59.859> think<00:02:00.249> it's<00:02:00.399> a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
stuff like that but I still think it's a

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.459 
stuff like that but I still think it's a
very<00:02:00.579> very<00:02:00.759> important<00:02:01.270> thing<00:02:01.509> that<00:02:01.780> important

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
very very important thing that important

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.709 
very very important thing that important
thing<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.799> know<00:02:02.979> where<00:02:03.369> you're<00:02:03.549> from<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:04.600> you

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
thing to know where you're from when you

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.899 
thing to know where you're from when you
start<00:02:04.960> any<00:02:05.229> movie<00:02:05.710> even<00:02:06.310> if<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:06.640> doesn't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
start any movie even if that doesn't

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.160 
start any movie even if that doesn't
come<00:02:07.060> up<00:02:07.210> even<00:02:07.390> if<00:02:07.539> it's<00:02:07.600> nobody<00:02:07.899> alive<00:02:08.020> and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
come up even if it's nobody alive and

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.419 
come up even if it's nobody alive and
even<00:02:08.320> if<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.440> don't<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:09.009> it's

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
even if you don't see that it's

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.280 
even if you don't see that it's
important<00:02:09.850> for<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.210> all<00:02:10.300> where<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.690> come

film I don't learn lines that much I

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.479 
film I don't learn lines that much I
don't<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.709> not<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:29.069> say<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.370> instance

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
don't it's not like say for instance

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.160 
don't it's not like say for instance
that<00:02:29.670> Shakespeare<00:02:30.090> piece<00:02:30.299> where<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.049> to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that Shakespeare piece where you have to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.559 
that Shakespeare piece where you have to
know<00:02:31.319> every<00:02:32.129> line<00:02:32.310> every<00:02:32.549> comma

it's<00:02:34.019> definitely<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.769> with<00:02:35.010> film<00:02:35.340> but

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
it's definitely with with film but

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.789 
it's definitely with with film but
particularly<00:02:36.299> more<00:02:36.569> than<00:02:36.690> film<00:02:36.930> because<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
particularly more than film because you

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.410 
particularly more than film because you
you<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.489> opportunity<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> improvise

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
you have the opportunity to improvise

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.569 
you have the opportunity to improvise
and<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.379> an<00:02:40.530> awful<00:02:40.829> lot<00:02:40.920> looser<00:02:41.190> all

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
and it's an awful lot looser all

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.319 
and it's an awful lot looser all
situations<00:02:42.269> an<00:02:42.360> awful<00:02:42.569> lot<00:02:42.659> looser<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:44.329> I'm

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329
