search<00:02:01.500> results<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.040> there's<00:02:02.189> only<00:02:02.310> one

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
search results but there's only one

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
search results but there's only one
pattern<00:02:02.850> called<00:02:03.240> sixes<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.810> threes<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
pattern called sixes and threes on

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
pattern called sixes and threes on
Ravelry<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> pattern<00:02:05.969> there

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
Ravelry and that's the pattern there

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.059 
Ravelry and that's the pattern there
sure<00:02:06.960> enough<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> choose<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
sure enough so I'm going to choose that

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.770 
sure enough so I'm going to choose that
pattern<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.700> takes<00:02:11.910> me<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
pattern and then it takes me to kind of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.370 
pattern and then it takes me to kind of

colorway and the closest color and it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.740 
colorway and the closest color and it
gives<00:03:29.130> me<00:03:29.220> choices<00:03:29.730> for<00:03:29.880> die<00:03:30.210> alot<00:03:30.480> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
gives me choices for die alot and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.620 
gives me choices for die alot and
everything<00:03:31.260> else<00:03:31.490> where<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.520> purchased<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.360> the

everything else where I purchased it the

purchase date the total paid etc and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.420 
purchase date the total paid etc and
also<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.700> project<00:03:38.940> has<00:03:39.390> multiple

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
also because this project has multiple

also because this project has multiple
yarn<00:03:41.430> colors<00:03:41.790> used<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.270> would<00:03:42.450> want<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.690> click

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
yarn colors used I would want to click

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.870 
yarn colors used I would want to click
Add<00:03:43.080> yarn<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.830> go<00:03:44.340> through<00:03:44.580> those<00:03:44.730> steps

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
Add yarn and go through those steps

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.390 
Add yarn and go through those steps
again<00:03:45.360> choosing<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.230> other<00:03:46.530> color<00:03:46.890> way<00:03:47.100> this

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
again choosing the other color way this

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.890 
again choosing the other color way this
this<00:03:47.550> pattern<00:03:47.850> actually<00:03:47.970> uses<00:03:48.390> three<00:03:48.600> colors

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
this pattern actually uses three colors

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.900 
this pattern actually uses three colors
so<00:03:48.930> go<00:03:49.260> through<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.560> three<00:03:49.740> times<00:03:50.010> choosing

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
so go through it three times choosing

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.090 
so go through it three times choosing
the<00:03:51.000> different<00:03:51.120> colorways<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.959> then<00:03:52.950> when<00:03:53.070> I

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
the different colorways and then when I

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.010 
the different colorways and then when I
get<00:03:53.220> down<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> notes<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.480> can<00:03:54.660> type<00:03:54.870> in

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
get down here to the notes I can type in
