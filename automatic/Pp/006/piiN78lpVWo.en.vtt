 hello to all today I will explain the 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.670
 spring summer 2015 trends by 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.530
 mac cosmetics as you know does something 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 one month I was in the store mac valÃ¨ncia 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.340
 doing a course with maite to set him 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.230
 I asked about the trends that were coming 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.450
 for this season and I explain them 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.520
 delighted so today I 'm going to 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.160
 explain to you the mac cosmetics 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.110
 makes the presentation of the four 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.270
 trends you've seen in the parades 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.640
 the presentation of the trends tends 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.410
 be spring summer and then autumn 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 winter as you know the trends are 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
 they take out of the parades so that each 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.070
 make-up artist aims at what more 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 repeat in the parades he attends 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.030
 and then they put it in common once they do 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.739
 the sharing between all the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.160
 makeup artists attending the parades 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.780
 see the four most marked trends 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 of each season the first trend 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 this season is called review the king 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.630
 of this trend is the eyeliner in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.149
 catwalk have seen many delineated 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.980
 be it the delineated classic to delineated 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.559
 a little more transgressors with some 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 aerodynamic brush that gives a roll 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.680
 a little more novel the other 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.810
 undisputed protagonist of this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 trend is the eyelash are the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.830
 very marked eyelashes 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.470
 and mask even in some parades it 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.790
 has seen even with small gobs of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.400
 mask that this I do not think what 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.780
 we get to see on the street but it's 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.460
 important that you know it is 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 using half-tabs or eyelashes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.320
 individual the half lashes is not 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 more than a normal tab cut by 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.550
 half and only one of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.690
 these two halves this season has 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.370
 changed a little the subject of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.590
 tabs since now instead of 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.780
 apply in the outer third as 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.180
 applied before apply in the center 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 of the eye to give more volume to this 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.350
 zone and it seems that you have the eye a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 little bigger the second trend is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 in light in it is to illuminate the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.650
 skin the lighting of this season is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.050
 has seen in a very subtle way but 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.270
 always with products or in cream or 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.770
 well fluids the powder has also been 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.150
 seen but to a lesser extent in others 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.190
 seasons we saw that apart from 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.869
 illuminate the skin was contoured with 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.490
 some dark product for example here 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.050
 under the cheekbone or in the area of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.780
 jaw this season is not 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.979
 outlined the face with dark tones 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.110
 they have only limited themselves to giving points 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.850
 of light with light tones in the areas that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.120
 We want the volume to be more 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.129
 third trend is tripathi 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.500
 try to combine earth tones in the 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.200
 eyes with brighter tones as you can 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.030
 be the green or the lilac tones all 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.769
 tones between them are very blurred 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 although there is color remains in a way 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.920
 as very integrated into the skin and very 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.810
 subtle the latest trend is the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.530
 tendency to no makeup already concerning the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.900
 skin 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.500
 we have been seeing it for several seasons now 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.299
 consists of applying products 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.159
 translucent on the skin so that we 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.349
 let see through them our 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.360
 own skin so that they are products 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.640
 always with a very light finish and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.829
 They are usually quite juicy on the catwalk 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.079
 What they have done this time is respect the 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.569
 Skin model without trying plugging 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.489
 freckles nor use very 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.109
 currents for dark circles one thing that 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.359
 I was struck by the photographs 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.280
 that was teaching me maite is that the 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.590
 Blusher looks super natural on the skin 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.700
 and super integrated and told me that this 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.650
 they had done it in a different way 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.359
 The first thing they did was apply the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.370
 blusher with bare skin without 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.560
 make up and then it 's applied in the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.299
 moisturizer then finally and 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.829
 they applied the makeup base always 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.019
 a foundation of makeup as I say 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.760
 light so you can see the blusher 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.489
 what's below and the truth is that 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.880
 it looked super nice and super 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.370
 natural because 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.340
 it shows that you wear rouge but not 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.380
 you would know how to say neither which nor how 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.940
 applied to make it so natural 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.980
 Well, these are the four 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.710
 trends of this season as you see 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.840
 there is no relative tendency to 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.180
 lips or eyebrows as I commented 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.130
 this is because most of the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.440
 parades wore very lips 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.190
 natural as hydrated simply 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.720
 with balsam it has not been seen as in 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 other seasons than all the lips 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.140
 will be in fluorine tones or the reverse is 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.670
 season seems like it's all a bit 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.100
 as more discreet and more natural 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.730
 then the eyebrows also told me that 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.840
 they were like naturals, but without 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.240
 be neither too profiling nor 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.860
 wild is a naturalness a 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.360
 little bit controlled about the color of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.760
 nails this season what has been most 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.650
 seen are natural tones that melt 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.810
 with the skin of the finger in some parade in 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.910
 concrete that has been seen apart from the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.190
 nail in nude tone a bit of glitter 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.910
 so that the nail reflects a little 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.890
 light 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.480
 I hope you liked the video and I 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.730
 have also liked the tendencies of 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.380
 this season 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.790
 please leave a comment here below 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.580
 telling me what our trend is 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.100
 favorite and undoubtedly mine is that of 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.470
 light have because the illuminator applies 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.110
 in a very subtle way and only 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.030
 applying light tones without applying the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.030
 dark tones as you see I never land 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.550
 outlining my face because I do not see it 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.200
 necessary and I like it much more how 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.060
 it remains if you only illuminate that if also 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.370
 you apply a dark tone on the skin another 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.140
 part that I love is that it is given 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.240
 prominence in the tab to me 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.100
 they like the eyelashes very marked but 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 that did not look artificial could not 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.060
 end the video without first giving 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.150
 thanks to maite to set for explaining 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.350
 the trends of this new season 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.480
 thank you very much maite for dedicating me 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.310
 a little bit of your time and a big kiss 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.930
 huge because what I said I hope that I have 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.900
 liked the video and see you the week 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.740
 coming on Tuesday with another new video 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.740
 see you later
