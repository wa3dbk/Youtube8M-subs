four years but it turns out we didn't

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.380 
four years but it turns out we didn't
really<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.430> any<00:01:56.640> cool<00:01:56.909> backstage

really get like any cool backstage

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.819 
really get like any cool backstage
passes<00:01:57.689> was<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.439> bummer<00:01:58.590> because

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
passes was just kind of a bummer because

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
passes was just kind of a bummer because
it<00:01:59.009> wasn't<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.369> his<00:01:59.579> shows<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> radio

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
stations show but I thought it was

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.430 
stations show but I thought it was
pretty<00:02:01.890> cool<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.460> randomly<00:02:02.880> ran

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
some fan and he told us about it and we

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.160
