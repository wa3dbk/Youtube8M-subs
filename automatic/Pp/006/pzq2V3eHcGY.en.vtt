00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.140 

I<00:00:05.750> think<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.839> heroine<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:08.240> somebody<00:00:09.530> who<00:00:10.530> is

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
I think a heroine is somebody who is

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.250 
I think a heroine is somebody who is
courageous<00:00:12.440> we<00:00:13.610> are<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.240> much<00:00:15.420> trouble<00:00:15.719> in

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260

the<00:00:16.320> world<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:19.170> would<00:00:19.830> be

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the world and I think that it would be

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.450 
the world and I think that it would be
great<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.820> shine<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.990> light<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.949> lot<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
great to shine some light on a lot of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.950 
great to shine some light on a lot of
heroines<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.150> don't<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:25.189> any<00:00:26.189> credits

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960

heroines that don't get any credits
including<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:31.219> woman<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.309> is

the<00:00:32.460> head<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> family<00:00:34.309> she<00:00:35.309> becomes<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the head of a family she becomes a
