00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.710
 Buch 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.050
 How was everyone, this guest of Daito Co., Ltd. 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.140
 It was the story of President Yoneya 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.489
 Mobile is a so-called mobile phone, and everyone holds 90% or more 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.530
 It is said that there 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 The so-called information terminal within 30 cm for 24 hours 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.930
 It is what a mobile phone 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:05.100
 And I think mobile email 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:07.250
 It's amazing that 75% of the weak signals check the new mail for that clothes 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.680
 It is a communication tool 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 But when from around about 10 years ago of multiple of the era is a mobile future is and e-mail is absolutely 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:24.080
 Any company's aggressive to say that I want to with promotional tool also a force in this mobile marketing 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 I put uh-but unfortunately it is almost a failure at the current stage 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 It says the reality is it is that I mean it was why 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:37.219
 I think that you all noticed in that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:41.090
 In fact, actually be marketing mobile phone rather than a mobile Puromoshon that mobile 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.970
 Most companies say that it is a so-called communication tool 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.770
 As a promotional tool 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.370
 Kape communication still is now but I think I was thinking mobile 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.650
 Mobile promotion as a tool or horse l 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:03.040
 Is it that you should think about marketing ? 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.150
 There is a registered member, who is in communication in reverse. 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.690
 Check 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:13.000
 It is possible to comprehensively exchange itself and also calf incident etc. 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:16.670
 Or Toka's impressions also that can return an e-mail in the form to Fu I mean I bought that it answer to the quiz 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.069
 As we make meatball soaked the situation, such as 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.359
 you have to 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:27.700
 The number of members increases 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:29.700
 To talk about then yeah Kai story to the survey this time that I'm lead to the unit price up 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.860
 That's what I got 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.310
 I love that I have a very interested For information on or rather full of marketing mobile 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.900
 Ne 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.349
 eh 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.379
 No doubt from now on mobile so-called smart phone Well today 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:46.579
 Although in an interview divided I'm such a smart phone 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:51.319
 The age of smartphones will come and 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:55.890
 Currently still is now the smart it is also getting more and more lower subscription rate of newspaper 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:00.180
 Because mobile marketing with a focus on phone is this is local 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.040
 Supermarket people become huge sales promotion tools and communication tools 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.170
 I think it means that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.920
 I think the problem is content I think it is very difficult to create content in the company 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.880
 That's why I completely outsource such things 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.530
 Outsourcing and being able to do without their own company will create it by themselves 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.470
 Outsourcing other things that can share information and delivering it more and more 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:29.050
 I think a way that says get is that I'm the best way 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.060
 And if it is possible thing that can share information and support as a communication tool 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.950
 Even more so 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.850
 Confirmation I think the probability that you can confirm the incoming call will increase more and more 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.819
 I am 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.469
 Lead pitcher 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:49.560
 How much can you make upfront investments after 5 years and 10 years 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:54.569
 Because it is not a big key in the future and in the sales promotion, it is absolutely mobile phone 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.049
 Because I I'm think mon not impassable and perhaps I mean the mobile is by all means 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.810
 Ne 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.470
 It seems that you have heard this interview 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.849
 In the Fu of hate from getting future full-scale also me before marketing after all 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.480
 Your company 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:12.060
 Or it is an opportunity this I Are You a manager to come seriously 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.060
 I think if you can think about it
