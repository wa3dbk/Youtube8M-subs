00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
nutrients that plants need for growth we

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
nutrients that plants need for growth we
dissolve<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:56.729> into<00:01:57.030> water<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:58.170> feed

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
dissolve them into water and we feed

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.289 
dissolve them into water and we feed
them<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> plans<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.399> reclaim<00:01:59.969> all

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
them to the plans and then reclaim all

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
them to the plans and then reclaim all
the<00:02:00.810> water<00:02:00.990> nutrients<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.680> used<00:02:01.890> by

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the water nutrients that are not used by

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.139 
the water nutrients that are not used by
plants<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.490> completely<00:02:02.850> closed

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
plants so it's a completely closed

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
plants so it's a completely closed
system<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> plants<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.200> absorb<00:02:04.500> what

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
system so the plants can absorb what

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.889 
system so the plants can absorb what
they<00:02:05.250> need<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> rest<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.360> recycled

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
they need and then the rest is recycled

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.150 
they need and then the rest is recycled
and<00:02:06.930> reused<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.590> absolutely<00:02:07.979> no

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and reused so we have absolutely no

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.529 
and reused so we have absolutely no
waste<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.149> growing<00:02:09.360> up
