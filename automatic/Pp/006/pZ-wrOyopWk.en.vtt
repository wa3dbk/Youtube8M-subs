 that the painter was born until 1815 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.180
 beyond these characters five different boats approaching 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.340
 the coast 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.170
 they seem to correspond to the figures 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.420
 five characters five ships 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.820

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.120
 the five people form a semicircle a curve that repeats in 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.920
 the mound of the coast pointing towards the nearest ship that already collects 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.990
 your candles to anchor 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.899
 beyond those curves to which the teacher was so fond are 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.170
 counterbalanced by the coordinates created by the horizon line and the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.509
 mast of the ship that divides the surface of the horizontal canvas and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.150
 vertically in the same center 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.330
 we are faced with a premonitory picture 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.180
