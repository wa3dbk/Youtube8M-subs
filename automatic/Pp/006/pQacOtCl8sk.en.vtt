00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.680
 good evening good morning or good 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.330
 noon depending on when you use this 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.610
 tutorial she is in that I show you 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.920
 as you watch here on your desktop 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.050
 a date display and other stuff 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.910
 but it can not be that cheap 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.279
 as seen with the windows mini 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.730
 mini-applications that you can do here then 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.140
 a watch holds nice blabla but what 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.059
 then I find something like me 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.519
 looks better, we need that 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.800
 program where a tenant we can 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.269
 download here free link too 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.890
 again in the description then 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.510
 you install this program 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.769
 if you have that installed you have to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.479
 take care that we do not have the 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.360
 portable version but the whole 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.040
 normal version installed then starts 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.839
 the program easy and we the her 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.449
 a welcome screen 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.430
 time the date and other information 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.440
 Of course we can do that through the system 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.600
 still modify and change because so 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.400
 is not that nice here we can 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.320
 we make a right click on one 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.210
 the window does not matter which one I do 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.479
 in the middle and then go up here 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.539
 Electro what the standards are going and 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.399
 then select wellcome and do 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.500
 the welcome screen away and then in 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.859
 me again and make the same 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.420
 feeds screen away so if you have them 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.469
 of course you can also have it 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.329
 there are others too 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.250
 things that I'm going to do there again 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.200
 can for example network if one 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.520
 would not mingle and yes that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.289
 could then move here like you 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 but the whole thing is not so 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.070
 beautiful 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.409
 that's why the child is there for that 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.609
 There are two types of skins and I show 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.320
 Just like this one 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.689
 installed for that you go on the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.070
 while art gives wayne tenant search here 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.979
 a link again in the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.170
 description then you will already many 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.560
 skins I'll just take this one 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.409
 here 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.999
 There are two types of skins for this 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.439
 I think yes that are both easy 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.190
 to install just once 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.600
 download and save 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.810
 because the whole then downloaded 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.530
 did you have the skin here could that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.600
 because they open and then you see here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.820
 rms king.de amy the kid then you do 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.830
 here a right click on the file and 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.650
 click on installer tenant skin or 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.170
 just open with and then you choose 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.520
 as well as the program here 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.860
 if that does not work out here 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.620
 search and then where he wayne 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.660
 meter installed and there will be 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 you then the skin installer point excel 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.420
 open at once so here 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.130
 ok went to the gate and was already 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.020
 successfully installed that was the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.170
 first method there is also one 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.670
 another way if you have a skin 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.620
 download it can happen or is 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.350
 it is a file in this file to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.910
 folder that means somehow I call 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.880
 now here in the example once test 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.340
 so and this folder you have to then 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.980
 just to a certain point 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.490
 copy on your main 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.280
 volume username and then your own 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.230
 Documents or skins here you have to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.010
 just for example the folder test 1 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.910
 copy from the file if you have a skin 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.950
 installed the not point rm skin is 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.540
 in the folder can also be 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.739
 even be fund that is then there but 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.300
 again you have to just then 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.770
 I have to open and install 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.660
 but also something in other videos 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.430
 done so now we have the one 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.239
 Of course there are many 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.520
 other 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.410
 so you can place everything nicely 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.510
 because you can still many here 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.100
 For example, changes are made here 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.080
 Of course you have to go elementary 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.180
 then can go to the skins mix well 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.830
 we can mix it here as well but we 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.140
 then go first to elementary and 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.420
 For example, here is the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.800
 first date or the second date that 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.019
 looks a bit different then 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.739
 depending on how you like it or also 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:53.380
 Here you can, for example, here 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.860
 also change the time with seconds 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.600
 or or without and so on if we are 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.670
 then here for example already here 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.519
 our doing it the way we have 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.040
 I want to take this over again 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.960
 the first date I like it then 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.000
 Can you say this here as you write 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.580
 us too we have five u 13 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.890
 but in reality on 17 03 10 that is 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.250
 quite a only very small changes we 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.480
 go here on elementary and on 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 settings point 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.240
 percent is trusted here we have to 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.680
 just save a few pa to go there 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.190
 and then down here you have wayne meter 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.630
 in the air 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.880
 But you have to after the chin 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.710
 you also have to do it 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440
 just here if that's not kids 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.860
 already there is just updating everything 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.800
 do 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.600
 Now I have to change days there 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.360
 now i have to update too and 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.570
 now I have already 17 clock 30 17 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.010
 13 instead of 5 13 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.540
 then I would say that need here 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.320
 I you can not then 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.050
 of course also in the wegschalten 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.880
 alimentari what is this here 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.110
 could be right now we have here 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.550
 Of course, some options 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.510
 We can do it then 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.490
 course again system 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.200
 Add information that you can 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.760
 which of course can ventilate everything 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.740
 now here at the settings the 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.880
 position but I want to 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.940
 that is also quite easy with the 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.250
 I place the transparency I have 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.930
 here also 0 percent then if times the 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.669
 mouse over it goes on the disappearance 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.450
 or the move is possible me 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.680
 I think I have a nice one now 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.720
 position found 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.310
 now i can do that now i can 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.540
 but do not move the lower one anymore 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.790
 upper one still then one here 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.040
 right click on the upper settings 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.430
 Move settings also possible 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.780
 do 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.700
 now it is not anymore 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.500
 movable and then there are also here 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.960
 save positions 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.820
 By clicking, of course, so too 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.220
 Can you already click through here 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.080
 So relaxed and it's natural 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.479
 really only on the desktop and here in 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.090
 is the browser or other applications 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.010
 not in the upper level for it now 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.780
 always women is displayed that was 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.540
 actually so the most important thing could be here 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.790
 I like rain tenants 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.430
 you can install skins 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.440
 can still a few settings yes 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.030
 if I forget something important 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.950
 I still knew something 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.200
 you want to be able to do it in the 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.300
 Write and write comments 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.729
 please in the comments who of you 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.950
 watched this video on 1080p and 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.590
 If I have the next videos synonymous in 1080p 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.630
 or if you 're all just 720 anyway 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.010
 or less cook 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.010
 so far until next time
