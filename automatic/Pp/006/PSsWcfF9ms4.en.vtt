00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020

 ice rink for the fourth and last 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.910
 huskies and the red devil from bad 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.340
 nauheim 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.110
 while the huskies are currently on one 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.150
 soothing second table space with 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800
 good prospects on the play offs 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 the middle-hessen always have to lie 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.529
 still to participate in the final round 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
 fear 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.830
 the huskies began to watch before 4473 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 promising a capital 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.130
 ball loss in the game structure of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.510
 Middle Hessen had then it's in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 the third minute the first good 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.130
 occasion of the game but failed 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.950
 twice at the nauheim gatekeeper 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.230
 jan durica but not 60 seconds later 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 The nauheimer also showed that they were with 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.379
 the intent to take something countable 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.480
 had come to Kassel 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 a blow of import defenders 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 corey mapes missed easily falsified 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 the housing guarded by michael bien 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 and instead struck in the behind the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.469
 gang 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.050
 it was better that the nauheimer de die 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.579
 loan alexander thiel at numerical 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.530
 he used one superiority 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 carelessness in the kasseler defensive 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.900
 and turned dry into the long corner 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.909
 For the first time Rabin was 0 to 1 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.710
 the north hessen was defeated in the backlog 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.810
 the huskies showed up in the wake 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.820
 but do not be shocked again and again 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.869
 They got the new engine in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 to bring danger 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.580
 daniel failed in the 14 minute minute 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.939
 SchmÃ¶lz after fine play by Thomas 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 Sony from the best position and also Lina 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.770
 thomas oli managed it in the 15 minute 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.790
 not his huge blow in the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.560
 to accommodate the gate 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 the best chance of compensation 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.840
 forgave shortly before the third however 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.299
 Mike Collins is a great solo with only 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 a loud klink on the rod green 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.970
 could so it went with the intermediate 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.259
 from 0 to 1 for the first break 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.479
 in the second third, the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 nauheimer first, that always happens 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.869
 Again , they used the mess in the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.640
 kasseler cover harmless 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.280
 in the morning 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.979
 logically, they were raised by ecm 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.520
 coach petri kujala first on two 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.619
 to zero 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.320
 max campell had an exemplary 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.869
 preparatory work by vitalij aab in the 25th 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 minute successfully completed and the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.810
 Around 300 fans are always in the mood 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 brought 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.890
 Not three minutes later, it came for the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.290
 husky fans even thicker wiedermal stg 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.390
 loan alex goal of even 3 0 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.770
 increased 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.239
 but finally the huskies also found 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.790
 a suitable answer 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.730
 quasi by post a christian pass found 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.819
 in austin further its customer the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.260
 kita finally in the 29 minute the first 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.600
 times could overcome 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 the spell was broken the huskies 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.590
 seem like unleashed and also defensive 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.640
 it was now the club did not even know 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.019
 brings in the 32 minute saved jan 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.300
 spectacular against dusan frog 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.850
 two minutes later was to tobias 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.590
 shot the latte to the spot and the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.170
 kassel huskies had before third 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.790
 another one in the quiver just after one 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.140
 another blue-white powerplay 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.180
 had passed without success 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.850
 who will regional a gully jerry 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 brown to 2 3 hits and 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 With that, it finally guaranteed hope 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.290
 camp of north hessian ice hockey fans 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 and almost that hope would have come 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.880
 beginning of the third third meets new 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.400
 husky matthias mÃ¼ller had in the 42 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.049
 minute of equalization before eyes gave but 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.079
 again only the rod 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.640
 the huskies pressed for compensation 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.329
 but could rarely the direct way 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.799
 to the gate 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.350
 and where is often worthwhile in 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.269
 individual actions in the middle of the kasseler 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.850
 high pressure phase, it came to but then 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.500
 Hunchback for the huskies on frog 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.230

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.570
 action in the 52 minute das 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.109
 deciding 2 too much for the red ones 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.000
 devil 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.859
 that's just my one and a half minutes 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.079
 even more in duplicate 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.920
 still the result reaches also 25 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.510

 Husky fans treat their charges with one 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.130
 warm applause of the pain of the
