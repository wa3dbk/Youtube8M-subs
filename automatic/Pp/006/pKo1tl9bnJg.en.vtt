really<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.340> run<00:00:26.580> he<00:00:27.029> advised<00:00:27.420> me<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
really be run he advised me that the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.800 
really be run he advised me that the
water<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.160> over<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.670> good<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.359> time<00:00:30.600> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
water is up over is good at this time to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
water is up over is good at this time to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
tie snow come in water a long time so I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.899 
tie snow come in water a long time so I
guess<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.300> about<00:00:33.690> time<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:35.100> had<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909
