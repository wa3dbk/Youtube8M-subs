on there so I stuck with these colors
here<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.019> they're<00:00:25.170> bright<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.619> easy<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

plane yet you get quite a distance away

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
plane yet you get quite a distance away
and<00:00:53.820> until<00:00:54.090> it'll<00:00:54.300> subside<00:00:54.449> err<00:00:54.629> upside<00:00:55.530> down

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and until it'll subside err upside down

and until it'll subside err upside down
or<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:55.920> side<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.370> by<00:00:56.719> what<00:00:57.719> type<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.550> design

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
or right side up by what type of design

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.220 
or right side up by what type of design
there<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> good<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.390> top<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> gonna<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.020> if

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there is good on top is gonna have if

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.689 
there is good on top is gonna have if
you<00:01:01.350> remember<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> other<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you remember on the other one the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.050 
you remember on the other one the
checker<00:01:03.000> boards<00:01:03.420> coming<00:01:03.660> across<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
checker boards coming across and so I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
checker boards coming across and so I
have<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.450> laid<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.530> side

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
have this one laid out now on this side

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.359 
have this one laid out now on this side
here<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.340> did<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.390> took<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:10.369> three

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
inch piece here and I laid it across the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.890 
inch piece here and I laid it across the
covering<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> used<00:01:17.700> what's<00:01:18.479> called<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
covering and I used what's called the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
covering and I used what's called the
woodpecker<00:01:19.409> which<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> tool<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.850> here

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
woodpecker which is this tool right here

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
woodpecker which is this tool right here
put<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.509> by<00:01:21.659> top<00:01:21.960> life<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.100> run<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
put out by top life and you just run it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
put out by top life and you just run it
across<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.960> pops<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.500> kinds<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
across here and it pops all kinds of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
across here and it pops all kinds of
little<00:01:26.369> holes<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.170> gas<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
little holes in it so that the gas that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.210 
little holes in it so that the gas that
is<00:01:29.270> created<00:01:30.270> from<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> heat<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> glue<00:01:31.560> has

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
is created from the heat on the glue has

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
is created from the heat on the glue has
some<00:01:32.549> place<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> escape<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.930> escapes

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
some place to escape to and escapes

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
some place to escape to and escapes
underneath<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.369> came<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.729> pretty<00:01:35.880> well

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
underneath and it came out pretty well

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
underneath and it came out pretty well
on<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.170> side<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:37.530> gonna<00:01:37.619> try<00:01:37.799> another<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
on this side I'm gonna try another a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.469 
on this side I'm gonna try another a
different<00:01:38.460> technique<00:01:39.000> where<00:01:39.270> we're<00:01:39.390> gonna

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
different technique where we're gonna

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
different technique where we're gonna
remove<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.200> center<00:01:40.560> section<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
remove this center section here and I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
remove this center section here and I
just<00:01:42.420> laid<00:01:42.750> down<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.200> bare<00:01:43.380> wood<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.770> you'll

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
just laid down with bare wood so you'll

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.170 
just laid down with bare wood so you'll
have<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> worry<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> gas<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.060> escaping

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
have to worry about the gas is escaping

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
have to worry about the gas is escaping
swear<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.049> from<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.320> side<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> other<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
swear it from one side to the other and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
swear it from one side to the other and
I<00:01:47.640> should<00:01:47.850> push<00:01:48.090> them<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:49.009> relatively

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I should push them all out relatively

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
I should push them all out relatively
good<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.570> I'm<00:01:51.659> gonna<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.960> I'm<00:01:52.079> using<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
good so what I'm gonna do is I'm using a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620 
good so what I'm gonna do is I'm using a
soldering<00:01:52.799> iron<00:01:53.149> because<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.299> gives<00:01:54.479> me<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
soldering iron because it gives me the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.870 
soldering iron because it gives me the
heat<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.590> make<00:01:55.920> my<00:01:56.040> cut<00:01:56.280> inside<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
heat and just make my cut inside the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.100 
heat and just make my cut inside the
lines<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:58.219> covering<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.399> overlap

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
lines there so my covering will overlap

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.920 
lines there so my covering will overlap
so<00:02:01.110> let's<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.890> it
