tutorial series in the lesson of today
we're<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.880> talk<00:00:09.179> about<00:00:09.630> genome<00:00:10.590> parison

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
we're going to talk about genome parison

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.070 
we're going to talk about genome parison
software<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:13.099> I'm<00:00:14.099> talking<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:15.080> parsing

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
software and I'm talking about parsing

in<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.700> example<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> use<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
in this example we're going to use a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.470 
in this example we're going to use a
very<00:00:41.520> popular<00:00:41.870> software<00:00:42.870> called<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.480> genome

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
very popular software called the genome

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and to access it as usual we type its

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.560

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
here genome scan at Google

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.850 
here genome scan at Google
and<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.850> hit<00:01:04.000> enter

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
and we hit enter

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.720 
and we hit enter
the<00:01:06.340> first<00:01:06.580> hit<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:07.210> our<00:01:07.690> software<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.920> there

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
the first hit is our software and there

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.160 
the first hit is our software and there
you<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:09.880> see<00:01:10.180> here<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:10.810> it's<00:01:11.530> hosted<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.670> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you can see here that it's hosted on the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280 
you can see here that it's hosted on the

MIT website or the Massachusetts and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.950 
MIT website or the Massachusetts and
secured<00:01:17.710> institute<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.400> technology<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.930> we

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
secured institute of technology so we

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.490 
secured institute of technology so we
clicking<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.190> first<00:01:21.430> head<00:01:22.390> here<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:23.290> is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
clicking on the first head here this is

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
clicking on the first head here this is
our<00:01:23.800> genome<00:01:24.340> scan<00:01:25.710> software<00:01:27.180> main<00:01:28.180> page<00:01:28.390> here

our genome scan software main page here

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.760 
our genome scan software main page here
so<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.689> have<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.990> make<00:01:32.109> sure<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.619> this

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
so you have to make sure that this

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.209 
so you have to make sure that this
option<00:01:33.549> organism<00:01:34.479> here<00:01:34.689> is<00:01:34.950> set<00:01:35.950> to

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
option organism here is set to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.090 
option organism here is set to
vertebrate<00:01:37.710> okay

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.710 

so<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.510> this<00:01:43.040> section<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.400> we're<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
so in this section here we're going to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.249 
so in this section here we're going to
paste<00:01:46.049> our<00:01:46.909> hour-long<00:01:47.909> DNA<00:01:48.600> sequence<00:01:49.049> here

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
paste our hour-long DNA sequence here

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
paste our hour-long DNA sequence here
and<00:01:51.470> it's<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.650> vertebrate<00:01:53.490> genome<00:01:54.090> sequence<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and it's a vertebrate genome sequence in

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.120 
and it's a vertebrate genome sequence in
a<00:01:54.780> FASTA<00:01:55.320> format<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.520> has<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.240> long

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
a FASTA format and it has to be a long

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.889 
a FASTA format and it has to be a long
enough<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.539> I'm<00:02:00.539> talking<00:02:01.140> about<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:02.340> than

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
enough and I'm talking about more than

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.700 
enough and I'm talking about more than
100,000<00:02:04.580> bases<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.670> pair<00:02:05.940> had<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.840> contain<00:02:07.200> at

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
100,000 bases a pair had to contain at

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.700 
100,000 bases a pair had to contain at
least<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.190> complete<00:02:08.729> gene

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
least one complete gene

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.690 
least one complete gene
and<00:02:11.540> alternatively<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.020> use<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:14.460> demo

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and alternatively you can use the demo

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
software okay in this second we're going

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.240 
software okay in this second we're going
that<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.020> paste<00:02:40.380> our<00:02:41.160> proteins<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
that you paste our proteins here and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.240 
that you paste our proteins here and
your<00:02:44.250> men<00:02:44.430> or<00:02:44.760> maybe<00:02:45.240> asking<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.380> proteins

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
your men or maybe asking what proteins

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.610 
your men or maybe asking what proteins
and<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:50.340> saying<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.810> also<00:02:52.050> need<00:02:52.590> to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and I'm saying that you also need to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.570 
and I'm saying that you also need to
have<00:02:53.330> protein<00:02:54.330> sequences<00:02:54.990> in<00:02:55.980> FASTA<00:02:56.430> format

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
have protein sequences in FASTA format

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.950 
have protein sequences in FASTA format
also<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.650> know<00:02:59.450> they<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.690> some

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
also that you know they have some

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.530 
also that you know they have some
significant<00:03:01.590> similarity<00:03:02.250> with<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.150> coding

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
significant similarity with the coding

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.030 
significant similarity with the coding
regions<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.200> your<00:03:04.470> DNA<00:03:04.980> sequence<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:06.980> how<00:03:07.980> we

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
regions in your DNA sequence and how we

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.450 
regions in your DNA sequence and how we
can<00:03:08.400> find<00:03:08.880> these<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.720> proteins<00:03:10.170> well<00:03:11.100> by

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
can find these that proteins well by

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.870 
can find these that proteins well by
using

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
using

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.250

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
will have our sequence here we copy it

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.390 
will have our sequence here we copy it
and<00:03:54.660> we'll<00:03:55.660> paste<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.050> here

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.820
