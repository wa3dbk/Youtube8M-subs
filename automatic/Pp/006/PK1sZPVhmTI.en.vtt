00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
shockwave you'll definitely see a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.580 
shockwave you'll definitely see a
difference<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.759> see<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.210> shockwave

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
difference there see this shockwave

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.370 
difference there see this shockwave
effect<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.579> nice<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:01.020> let's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
effect which is really nice and let's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.450 
effect which is really nice and let's
choose<00:02:02.159> unseen<00:02:02.820> abyss<00:02:03.799> similar<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.009> shockwave

a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.850> different<00:02:06.619> abstract<00:02:07.619> artist<00:02:08.129> let's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
a little different abstract artist let's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.010 
a little different abstract artist let's
try<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.170> that's<00:02:10.170> different<00:02:10.500> okay<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
try that that's different okay and of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.420 
try that that's different okay and of
course<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.530> drag<00:02:13.860> your<00:02:14.069> finger

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
course you can just drag your finger

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.710 
course you can just drag your finger
along<00:02:14.550> as<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.300> create<00:02:15.480> additional

along as well to create additional
effects<00:02:16.700> heavy<00:02:17.700> taps<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.410> really

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
effects heavy taps so you get a really

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.850 
effects heavy taps so you get a really
big<00:02:20.280> wave<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.209> then<00:02:21.959> last<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.770> not

board<00:02:33.510> now<00:02:33.660> let's<00:02:33.870> try<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.709> iPad<00:02:35.160> I

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
board now let's try it out on the iPad I

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.339 
board now let's try it out on the iPad I
definitely<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.690> looks<00:02:36.840> better<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
definitely think it looks better on the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.140 
definitely think it looks better on the
larger<00:02:37.709> screen<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.220> iPad<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:38.970> more

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
larger screen of the iPad it's just more

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.210 
larger screen of the iPad it's just more
suited<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.739> change<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
suited for that you can change the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580 
suited for that you can change the
friends<00:02:41.700> per<00:02:41.849> second<00:02:42.209> up<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.330> 60<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> iPad

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
friends per second up to 60 on the iPad

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.400 
friends per second up to 60 on the iPad
the<00:02:43.920> hardware<00:02:44.879> this<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> iPad<00:02:45.780> 3<00:02:46.050> or<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the hardware this is the iPad 3 or the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.740 
the hardware this is the iPad 3 or the
new<00:02:46.560> iPad<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.489> handle<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.660> then

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
new iPad so it can handle that and then

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.960 
new iPad so it can handle that and then
you<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:49.110> these<00:02:49.379> fingertips<00:02:50.190> notice<00:02:50.819> this

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970

theme here the fingertips and you can

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.540 
theme here the fingertips and you can
really<00:02:54.540> use<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.989> multi-touch<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.280> large

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
really use the multi-touch on that large

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.089 
really use the multi-touch on that large
screen<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> use<00:02:57.269> all<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.629> fingers<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.920> create

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
screen to use all your fingers to create

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.559 
screen to use all your fingers to create
the<00:02:59.400> water<00:02:59.610> effects<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.360> looks

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
the water effects and that really looks

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.170 
the water effects and that really looks
really<00:03:00.989> nice<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.220> largest<00:03:02.610> screen<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
really nice on the largest screen of the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
really nice on the largest screen of the
iPad<00:03:03.540> as<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.840> see<00:03:04.019> there<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:05.190> think<00:03:05.370> this

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
iPad as you see there so I think this

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.960 
iPad as you see there so I think this
this<00:03:05.940> theme<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.300> definitely<00:03:06.900> more<00:03:07.349> suited

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
this theme is definitely more suited

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.729 
this theme is definitely more suited
towards<00:03:08.970> only<00:03:09.450> eye<00:03:09.480> towards<00:03:10.200> usage<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
towards only eye towards usage on the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.190 
towards only eye towards usage on the
iPad<00:03:11.159> it<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.940> looks<00:03:12.150> better<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.659> iPad<00:03:13.050> is

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
iPad it just looks better the iPad is

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.250 
iPad it just looks better the iPad is
faster<00:03:13.769> than<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.159> iPhone<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:15.120> being<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.690> 4s

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
faster than the iPhone that being the 4s

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.030 
faster than the iPhone that being the 4s
or<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.590> iPhone<00:03:16.709> 4<00:03:17.159> of<00:03:17.280> course<00:03:18.769> again<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.800> just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
or the iPhone 4 of course again I just

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.619 
or the iPhone 4 of course again I just
can't<00:03:20.430> emphasize<00:03:20.670> enough<00:03:21.180> how<00:03:21.209> much<00:03:21.450> that

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
can't emphasize enough how much that

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.059 
can't emphasize enough how much that
bigger<00:03:21.840> screen<00:03:22.170> makes<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.500> difference<00:03:22.890> with

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
bigger screen makes a difference with

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.979 
bigger screen makes a difference with
the<00:03:23.159> effects<00:03:23.550> if<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.360> want<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.599> try<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.840> out

the effects if you want to try it out

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.300 
the effects if you want to try it out
for<00:03:25.140> yourself<00:03:25.590> then<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.890> know<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.099> to<00:03:26.190> do
