00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 the breed came into being in the 18th century and is of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.450
 british 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.550
 the first animals to tread on soil 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.889
 Brazil went to the Rio Grande do Sul 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.570
 South in the early 20th century 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.670
 some characteristics such as 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 rusticity and made a gesture in a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.730
 easy to adapt to the climate and race 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 the low-skinned cattle that will 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.980
 the color straw to brown the eyes popped 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.289
 and the animals not a horn 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.260
 but what attracts the most attention is the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.510
 docility of the breed a facilitator in the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.809
 barbecuing management field of slopes 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.570
 the temperate climate cold nights and days 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 but they stand up to any 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 temperature this herd with 150 animals 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.390
 It is from Rafael that the relation with the race is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.329
 family he says he spent almost 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 life with them and reveals what they feel 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.940
 by genius unrelated to segesp 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.730
 event and when I was a boy when I went 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.250
 began to grow on the farm after 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.309
 My father started to create and today I am 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.650
 creating the only agencies of love scotland 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 sentimental relationship with him many years 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 to that the race that proportion we have 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 good stuff 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.640
 one of the characteristics of the breed is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 longevity the average life span is 10 to 12 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 years 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.450
 the intimate is the oldest cow on the farm 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.590
 at age 15 she is in full activity 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.570
 in a few days another theory is born 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.570
 another trademark of the gesture is the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.640
 milk that is not for cutting is the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.590
 the second largest producer of the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.350
 world according to the association of the creators 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.780
 of cattle general mines jersey 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.729
 the cows of the rafael herd produce 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.399
 between 20 and 25 liters 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
 in total the production reaches 500 liters 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.100
 per day they are genetically 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.399
 improved and feed is grass silage 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.920
 and all these factors value the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.460
 value of milk the breeder sells the liter 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.560
 between 30 cents in r $ 1 milk cattle 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.320
 The milk has a high content of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 fat content to people 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.550
 obtain a price differential for the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.470
 greater milk resale 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.470
 then in that same commercially better
