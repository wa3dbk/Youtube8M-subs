00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.529
 hours earlier the digital call of duty 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.779
 modern warfare version can play 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 actually it is very simple i have that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850
 now with a disposable e-mail 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.750
 somehow there are private users 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 created in new zealand and you have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 a disposable e-mail used for that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.410
 account just enter google 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.940
 E-mail or find it already 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.680
 such programs and yes there you see us 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 actually only 31 at night 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.270
 sunday the 2 november and there is 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.640
 now only ten hours 8 minutes 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.650
 Can I play the game so that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.049
 12 hours earlier 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:12.390
 it may be the november was to sunday 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:18.320
 play yourself and yes, unfortunately it works 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.939
 then only in the New Zealand account 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.630
 but if you already train yourself 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.119
 and watch how the game behaves 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 not that eureka directly at the beginning 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.880
 goes to it and so well I hope the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.890
 zebras liked 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 new users can easily be found here 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.549
 ask if you have questions so you have 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.049
 you must also in the postel code and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.240
 specify address everything just looks in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.040
 google after you actually find everything 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 simply new zealand of your city 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.549
 raussuchen the houses in there then that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.649
 postel trauma contact and the province 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.420
 So it would have to specify everything when 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.430
 I create user-imagine the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.430

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.959
 since I am only at home in the evening 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.099
