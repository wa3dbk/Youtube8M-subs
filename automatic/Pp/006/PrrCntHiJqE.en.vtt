which<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.329> radar<00:01:48.720> stays<00:01:48.960> active<00:01:49.170> while<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
which the radar stays active while the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.219 
which the radar stays active while the
aiming<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.159> site<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.390> awesome<00:01:52.049> I've

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
aiming down site and that's awesome I've

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
aiming down site and that's awesome I've
been<00:01:52.979> killed<00:01:53.250> many<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> time<00:01:53.850> because<00:01:54.180> I've

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
been killed many a time because I've

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.819 
been killed many a time because I've
been<00:01:54.479> aiming<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:54.930> side<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:55.470> weapon<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
been aiming down side with my weapon and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.940 
been aiming down side with my weapon and
that'll<00:01:56.670> make<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.119> useful<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.869> its<00:01:58.439> cap

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that'll make it very useful also its cap

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
that'll make it very useful also its cap
out<00:01:59.130> ability<00:01:59.490> aside<00:01:59.759> from<00:01:59.880> increasing<00:02:00.329> damage

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
out ability aside from increasing damage

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600 
out ability aside from increasing damage
is<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> weapon<00:02:01.409> boosts<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:02.100> speed

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
is this weapon boosts more speed

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.780 
is this weapon boosts more speed
movespeed<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.840> fires<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> hair<00:02:05.310> trigger<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
movespeed and fires on a hair trigger so

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.830 
movespeed and fires on a hair trigger so
you<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.000> need<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> pull<00:02:06.329> down<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> trigger

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you don't need to pull down the trigger

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
you don't need to pull down the trigger
down<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.259> entire<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.429> could<00:02:08.640> be

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
down the entire way which could be

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.240 
down the entire way which could be
interesting<00:02:09.149> those<00:02:09.899> are<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> only<00:02:10.289> two<00:02:10.619> Scout

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
interesting those are the only two Scout

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.140 
interesting those are the only two Scout
rifles<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> database

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
rifles that are in the database

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.290 
rifles that are in the database
currently<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
currently that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.910 
currently that
I'm<00:02:13.390> assuming<00:02:14.050> they're<00:02:14.170> gonna<00:02:14.260> add<00:02:14.470> more<00:02:14.740> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I'm assuming they're gonna add more and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.560 
I'm assuming they're gonna add more and
if<00:02:15.010> they<00:02:15.130> don't<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.580> guess<00:02:15.820> I'll<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.120> okay<00:02:16.420> with

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
if they don't I guess I'll be okay with

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.880 
if they don't I guess I'll be okay with
it<00:02:16.600> those<00:02:17.050> two<00:02:17.230> weapons<00:02:17.590> are<00:02:17.680> kind<00:02:17.830> of

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
it those two weapons are kind of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.010 
it those two weapons are kind of
interesting<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:19.330> seems<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.930> be

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
interesting and it seems that I'm to be

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.630 
interesting and it seems that I'm to be
using<00:02:20.320> auto<00:02:20.500> rifles<00:02:20.920> more<00:02:21.070> than<00:02:21.190> Scout<00:02:21.430> rifles

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
using auto rifles more than Scout rifles

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
using auto rifles more than Scout rifles
now<00:02:21.940> because<00:02:22.390> I've<00:02:22.990> decided<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.710> was

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
now because I've decided that I was

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.740 
now because I've decided that I was
wrong<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> begin<00:02:24.670> with<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.180> auto<00:02:25.390> rifles

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
wrong to begin with and that auto rifles

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.080
