00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
miles away from the coastline so we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.889 
miles away from the coastline so we

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
evacuate where the wave hit even though

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
evacuate where the wave hit even though
they<00:00:51.780> were<00:00:51.840> telling<00:00:52.320> people<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.739> need<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> get

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they were telling people you need to get

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
away you need to get away from the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
away you need to get away from the
shorelines<00:00:54.899> need<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.410> away<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
shorelines need to get away from the
water<00:00:56.480> just<00:00:57.480> watching<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.020> wave<00:00:58.379> hit<00:00:58.800> and

buildings all around us as there were

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the ground it was something I you know I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.170 
the ground it was something I you know I
hope<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.479> never<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> hear<00:02:04.110> again<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
hope I never have to hear again but

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.740 
hope I never have to hear again but
unfortunately<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.299> keep<00:02:06.509> getting

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
unfortunately we keep getting

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.190 
unfortunately we keep getting
aftershocks<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.129> minute<00:02:08.879> or<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.660> far<00:02:09.959> enough

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
aftershocks a minute or so far enough

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.630 
aftershocks a minute or so far enough
probably<00:02:10.709> probably<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.190> other<00:02:11.310> ones<00:02:11.550> as

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
probably probably to be other ones as

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.809 
probably probably to be other ones as
well

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
well

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.729 
well
and<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> reality<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> mean<00:02:13.170> living<00:02:13.409> in

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and the reality is I mean living in

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.280 
and the reality is I mean living in
Japan<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.609> is<00:02:14.819> something<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.749> you're<00:02:16.260> very

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
Japan this is something that you're very

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.649 
Japan this is something that you're very
used<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.219> you<00:02:17.459> say<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.480> course

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
used to but as you say and of course

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.179 
used to but as you say and of course
there's<00:02:18.870> people<00:02:19.230> who've<00:02:19.530> lived<00:02:19.769> there<00:02:19.980> all

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
there's people who've lived there all

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.309 
there's people who've lived there all
their<00:02:20.219> lives<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.510> when<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.109> is

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
their lives they know when this is

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.420 
their lives they know when this is
different<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.129> felt<00:02:23.819> very<00:02:24.269> different

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
different and this felt very different

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.039 
different and this felt very different
it<00:02:26.430> absolutely<00:02:26.969> did<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.299> think<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.749> is<00:02:27.870> going

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
it absolutely did I think this is going

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.890 
it absolutely did I think this is going
to<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.670> tremor<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.879> remember<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> speak

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
to be a tremor to remember so to speak

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.390 
to be a tremor to remember so to speak
and<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.920> people<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.129> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> be

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and I think people are going to be

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
and I think people are going to be
talking<00:02:32.579> about<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.239> long<00:02:33.480> time<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
talking about this for a long time to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.140 
talking about this for a long time to
come<00:02:34.109> because<00:02:34.500> really<00:02:34.859> Tokyo<00:02:35.670> hasn't<00:02:36.030> seen

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
come because really Tokyo hasn't seen

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.470 
come because really Tokyo hasn't seen
anything<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.689> this<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.139> decades

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
anything like this in decades

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.449 
anything like this in decades
half<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> century<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.469> Matt<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.980> mentioned

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
half a century and Matt you mentioned

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.309 
half a century and Matt you mentioned
your<00:02:41.760> wife<00:02:41.939> is<00:02:42.150> Japanese<00:02:42.359> so<00:02:42.959> for<00:02:43.169> her

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
your wife is Japanese so for her

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.369 
your wife is Japanese so for her

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
presumably when when this quake hit she

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.099 
presumably when when this quake hit she
was<00:02:46.590> no<00:02:46.799> doubt<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.159> little<00:02:47.579> Karma<00:02:48.180> perhaps<00:02:48.659> the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
was no doubt a little Karma perhaps the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.649 
was no doubt a little Karma perhaps the
new<00:02:49.319> were<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:50.430> she<00:02:50.609> would<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.849> used<00:02:51.449> to
