 unnatural unchanged 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.140
 in a word brevity

 dating back to the second millennium BC 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.410
 they represent a dog that resembles 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.410
 very much to today's race 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.500
 for a long time the dog was a dog 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.720
 wild that lived the limits of the

 Bedouin camps approaching alone 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.250
 to steal some leftover food 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.909
 the canal doc standard requires a 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.320
 dog and vigorous pages suitable for the desert 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.360

 went that is typical of dogs 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.750
 primitives very wary of 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:03.049
 strangers is very sweet with the people who

 sensitivity comes to adapt his 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.819
 I pass on to them even though they are very small 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.099
 not to make them fall not only dogs 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.230
 young people but also adults support 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.030
 willingly turn into friends

 hairy puppy with two figures 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.830
 the dog at the dog is the only primitive dog 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.290
 to be used as a guard rather than 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.360
 It is hunting most dogs 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.150
 defends the house and the garden because 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.940
 They belong to his master ca nun them 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.280
 he defends because he considers them his and his 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.950
 all the people are the things that are 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.290
 found within the territory 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.510
 master understood with people who do not 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.690
 he knows the ca nun is wary and shy 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.550
 it is not easy to win the trust e 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.590
 he won't let himself be caressed either 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.590
 touch until it is granted 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.630
 the primitive dogs have equally 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.310
 developed the pist hearing and smell 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.620
 This allows the ca nun to alert 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.020
 a suspicious presence at a distance 5 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.930
 times greater than that detected in 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.210
 other races willingly befriends with 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.520
 dogs of different breed and endures 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.940
 patiently the puppies for boring that 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.280
 may be the ca nun is usually 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.840
 kind to other animals 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 his predatory instinct and rather 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.960
 moderate and to the man friend however who gives 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.480
 all of himself 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.180
 ghana is the typical dog of one 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.460
 master with the rest of the family e 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.140
 lovable and helpful but his heart 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.320
 only beats for the person you are 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.660
 choice this is not necessarily 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.360
 the one who feeds him 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.370
 he is not sold for so little and instead 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.590
 the person who is close to him 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.600
 he lives and works alongside him who knows how to 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.600
 talk to him and win his trust 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.440
 born for large spaces is a dog that has 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.660
 need to do a lot way is not 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.520
 it is essential to have a garden but 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.540
 you need to find the time to take it to 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.540
 run as often as possible 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.579
 and rather independent and can do 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.639
 long exploratory tours before returning 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.250
 from the master always as a good cognitive 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.410
 however, he does not know what a car is 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.060
 who considers a comfortable bed 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.250
 traveling 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.050
 about which we remember that for the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.270
 dog went that this word means 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.820
 ton 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.639
 he is a desert dog not a type to 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.220
 pillows and rivals don't even try to 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.620
 let him accept the classic and kill him 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.919
 it'll ignore it and it will manufacture a 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.919
 improper 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.350
 fall in love and at first sight of a 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.420
 primitive is not easy but when yes 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.500
 it almost begins to know them well 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:03.260
 impossible not to fall in love because it was there 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.290
 once the gap and fortunately there is 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.290
 yet
