 introduce version 4 of the profile vest 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.929
 a card or how to improve line 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.910
 improvable then to some 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 some small remarks clients I 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.350
 decided to completely redo the vest 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 so I still kept what 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.699
 worked well to know 80% of things 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.260
 I changed 1% others so what 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.179
 regarding the material I use 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.219
 always the same fabric to know a 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.489
 polyester ripstop the bottle base 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.380
 recycled for the color you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.379
 will also notice I went from 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.809
 beige to gray and gray a color I 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.190
 would rather say kamel so that suited 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 to people who told me that the Belgian 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 was too light and scratching too much 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 French so I decided between 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 two I added a small and small 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.699

 inside a nice series raffy in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.960

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.309
 peculiarities of this vest the big 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.310
 claimed by many we kept a 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.649
 clamping system here to detect 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.490
 walfoot rahmane we always have

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.950
 with the suction pad site for those who 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.950
 are afraid of losing their box 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.920
 this system has it in every pocket 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.289

 same if I reinforced the sam magnets 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.700
 had been claimed because the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.840
 found not strong enough the customers to 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.620
 rightly so the is strengthened is 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.739
 some also told me that it was 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.130
 too thick so I have a thick sister 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.190
 here and the other we will find at 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.630

 same pocket level here in our on the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.950
 side always the same system very 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:23.340
 practice that finally allows fishing 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:26.620
 to remove his vest with one hand 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.270
 which we find this pocket here that has 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.720

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.480
 note of some of you on

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.460
