00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 the following is just a parody 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.370
 and should not hurt a real person 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 embody or make recognizable 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:18.439
 humble and please think as well 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 the special features of the close to the 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 typical features of the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.769
 lyrical typical special features the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.830
 pronounced difficult features 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:38.579
 the most typically distinct 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.059
 Irish, just as it is now 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.899
 just able to explain to me 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:49.190
 like aids or what it is at the poem 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.190
 analysis arrives 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:05.320
 laura seriously we are talking in 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.510
 this case of a comparison or 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 but rather of the reification as 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.369
 rhetorical device 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.560
 it would have the comparison are very accurate 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.560
 it is the reification and that's why 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.670
 okay i think the job is 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.640
 Clearly here now found on this text 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.460
 to interpret 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.270
 after analyzing him that means yes 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.090
 all right 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.090
 you will now be the first 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.899
 Features the features 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.899
 write out any abnormalities 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.930
 then interpret what it is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.600
 can act as you open up the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.970
 text goes to a please 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.380
 you look at the features and the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.840
 special features 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.450
 then you will be in one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 summary text or in one 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.100
 coherent in a flowing 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.070
 text the office we understood 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.520
 we've got that , I know everything okay 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.890
 clear 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.920
 and then you will be there 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.900
 on the other hand, we can then go into macro 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.090
 form it can be almost circular 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.060
 You can call the diagram so you can call it all 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.830
 The picture is not perfect here 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.630
 you can see that is pretty nice here 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.640
 how I did that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.959
 it's about content 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:43.860
 function and the formal aspects of everything 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:45.060
 everything revolves ok, peter already 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.390
 finished with the tasks 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.239
 well then let me see that yes sees 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.430
 well out of it, just keep doing it 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:02.530
 and then 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.580
 should that be correct then there's 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.860
 Please the sheet on what underneath 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.090
 fallen it is just her now 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.940
 serious but 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.110
 where friends that 's it already is it 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.550
 maybe noticed that 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.260
 on the one hand always the same t-shirt 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.480
 including when I played teacher 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.879
 on the other hand , one of you would have 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:30.459
 Such teacher situation where you look 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:31.870

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.599
 You definitely need to know which school you are 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.019

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.940

 it's fun and yes it is 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.660
 simply it's just my view as 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.750

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.400

 means I thought so cool and 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:06.700

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.160

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.510
