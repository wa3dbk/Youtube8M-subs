00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.400
 I hope the form of one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.019
 quality settings to everything great 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.310
 is working 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 We are here and south of LÃ¶wenstein 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.510
 Do not hesitate, we will go through here 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.050
 they make the quest is the area 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.329
 Bloodstream coast 45 to 55 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 we are little secret that is 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.510
 Just show me where I needed it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 Stone as a cool thing on the storm 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 cliffs islands 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 Let's start north and here is one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.020
 craft points and from there shows 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840
 now just 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.140
 Of course, it starts off great 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 event 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.399
 but no matter because shit now just 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.609
 on it because I'm here in a portal 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.140
 the raging reporter asset and easy 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.609
 sometimes just here which you can see the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 In any case, the event is running 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.930
 then one can also nice to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.460
 killing types if you have not already 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.810
 then you just go 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 Continue straight ahead with ted com 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 as you can see I am level 55 right now 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.780
 actually it gets a bit too high 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.180
 but it is always very pleasant 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.950
 so here at the end you will find a port of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.830
 I also said interest oh 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.040
 come so confused that they have a portal 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.390
 the portal went through 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 Now you can enter an instance 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 the holy hall of secrets and 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.960
 As you can see there is a single point 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
 of interest and that's it 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.409
 cool thing is that here are 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 somehow so many people and here 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 friendly people jump out of left 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.640
 jump out around when the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.520
 are friendly 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.079
 but here she goes maybe she is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 later still I do not know much 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.299
 too much I found her cool all over 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.700
 secrets and if you can too 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.290
 talk to the people and so and help 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.689
 you test them so weird a huge 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.549
 earth in the world that is not honest 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.259
 earth is every guy is facing the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.660
 south portal tells me you come him 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.340
 scream and up here is a roller 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 this is the name of the valent war before the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.220
 planet and these are not to the wall 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.420
 said you are not in the order and soja 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.970
 Do you want to get angry or should not I? 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.739
 once over away namely smooth as well 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 here on the right as on the left there is the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.950
 point of interest but you can get there 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.129
 not there so I know now 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.120
 at least with 550 serenade and yes he 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.709
 just go times back here 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.810
 and just at that moment drove 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.840
 has run against this has the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.610
 Point of interest for me activated and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.290
 has the whole area discovered something cool 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.420
 then I got a chest and 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.769
 opened with this troupe and has 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 My 8000 experience is easy 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.489
 so free of charge because I just stop it all 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.959
 i have discovered territory 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.610
 then the tour got no was no 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.650
 item in it or something just just 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.629
 the 8000 experience but then I just 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.790
 thought that is a very good thing 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.530
 limited here if not impassable 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.150
 should happen well but as I said 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.590
 that was enough for us we have 8000 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.980
 get experience and when we get out of there 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.750
 went 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.849
 bergkamen people shows it is easy times 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.440
 that made me really short 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.470
 video but that's just right 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:23.760
 re-upload and yes I will have fun 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:25.230
 until then and now there are still like me 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.739
 look of color smells a bit 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.319
 funny 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.319
 yes that was it then
