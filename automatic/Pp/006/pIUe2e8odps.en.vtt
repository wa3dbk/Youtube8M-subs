00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello girls hello everyone what a pleasure 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:08.360
 greet them as always today I'm going to 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.299
 present a very easy design of 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.660
 make a very color with neon color 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:19.029
 vibrant and we're going to need our 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.970
 nails already know clean completely dry 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.710
 totally free of any chemical and 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.400
 we are going to apply an enamel base 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.349
 transparent subsequently a glaze 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.520
 colorful already know that the choice of 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.629
 color is very particular and subsequently 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.059
 let's apply what is the tape 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.920
 isolate in this case or any tape 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.530
 that serves them for 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.739
 divide your nail in half shape 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.420
 vertical and only from one side we're going to 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.449
 apply as you appreciate here in 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.479
 the images the cracked enamel in 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.129
 this case I am using black enamel 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.199
 the tape will be very useful 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.210
 so that the enamel is not watered by 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.460
 where we do not want 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.710
 we apply it calmly we hope that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.820
 dry out you know it's only one pass 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.890
 so you can stay perfectly 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.220
 we do it calmly we release the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.590
 isolate tape and we will stay 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.440
 this way only half of the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.430
 nail cracked and then we will 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.860
 use fantasy rhinestones 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.650
 and I 'm going to occupy these little squares so 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.730
 nice ones that are silver and 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.530
 black color I will apply them from the side 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.220
 where the nail is free where there is no 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.330
 glaze craquelure and at the end and super 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.780
 important is to apply a top coat to 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.300
 give duration and resistance to our 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.400
 design 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.250
 As you can appreciate the design is very 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.370
 easy is very simple the truth is that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.170
 it looks very good it 's very showy I hope that 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.380
 I have been to your liking I send you a kiss 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.380
 very large See you soon bye
