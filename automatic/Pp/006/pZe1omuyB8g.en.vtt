discovered<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.439> we<00:01:26.500> were<00:01:26.619> having<00:01:26.770> some

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
discovered that we were having some

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.800 
discovered that we were having some
nitrous<00:01:27.490> distribution<00:01:28.210> issues<00:01:28.509> with<00:01:28.689> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
nitrous distribution issues with the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.929 
nitrous distribution issues with the
factory<00:01:29.229> intake<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.039> we<00:01:30.159> decided<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.670> put<00:01:30.820> the

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
factory intake so we decided to put the

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.029 
factory intake so we decided to put the
boss<00:01:31.179> intake<00:01:31.570> manifold<00:01:31.990> back<00:01:32.200> on<00:01:32.439> and<00:01:32.859> it

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
boss intake manifold back on and it

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.590 
boss intake manifold back on and it
seems<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.460> have<00:01:33.549> cured<00:01:33.820> our<00:01:33.939> problems<00:01:34.420> and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
seems to have cured our problems and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.760 
seems to have cured our problems and
we're<00:01:34.719> going<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:34.929> find<00:01:35.200> out<00:01:35.320> when<00:01:35.469> we<00:01:35.560> take<00:01:35.679> it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
we're going to find out when we take it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.859 
we're going to find out when we take it
down<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:35.950> track<00:01:36.159> yeah<00:01:36.399> absolutely<00:01:36.609> 100%<00:01:37.359> now

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
down the track yeah absolutely 100% now

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.810 
down the track yeah absolutely 100% now
as<00:01:38.170> far<00:01:38.500> as<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> tune<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.070> concerned<00:01:39.429> what<00:01:39.640> kind

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
as far as a tune is concerned what kind

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.370 
as far as a tune is concerned what kind
of<00:01:39.880> gas<00:01:40.060> we're<00:01:40.270> using<00:01:40.450> here<00:01:40.689> today<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.259> know

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
of gas we're using here today you know

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.169 
of gas we're using here today you know
we<00:01:41.710> really<00:01:41.859> want<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.189> take<00:01:42.369> this<00:01:42.490> car<00:01:42.729> as<00:01:42.820> fast

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
we really want to take this car as fast

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.510 
we really want to take this car as fast
as<00:01:43.359> we<00:01:43.479> possibly<00:01:43.509> can<00:01:44.200> when<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.619> went<00:01:44.799> 10<00:01:45.070> 60s

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
as we possibly can when we went 10 60s

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.599 
as we possibly can when we went 10 60s
we<00:01:45.700> had<00:01:46.109> 85<00:01:47.109> in<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.439> but<00:01:48.159> we've<00:01:48.280> seen<00:01:48.549> some

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
we had 85 in it but we've seen some

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.120 
we had 85 in it but we've seen some
great<00:01:48.969> results<00:01:49.479> with<00:01:49.659> FTW<00:01:50.320> purple<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:51.039> we

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
great results with FTW purple so we

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.219 
great results with FTW purple so we
decided<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.579> put<00:01:51.789> some<00:01:51.939> FTW<00:01:52.479> purple<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:53.020> the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
decided to put some FTW purple in the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.169 
decided to put some FTW purple in the
car<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.829> we<00:01:53.920> picked<00:01:54.130> up<00:01:54.159> about<00:01:54.429> 10<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.820> 15

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
car and we picked up about 10 to 15

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.789 
car and we picked up about 10 to 15
wheel<00:01:55.359> horsepower<00:01:55.539> after<00:01:56.170> adjusting<00:01:56.619> our

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
wheel horsepower after adjusting our

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.380 
wheel horsepower after adjusting our
custom<00:01:57.189> tune<00:01:57.340> for<00:01:57.609> it<00:01:57.700> there<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:57.999> go<00:01:58.149> this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
custom tune for it there you go this

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.209 
custom tune for it there you go this
thing's<00:01:58.630> pretty<00:01:58.899> much<00:01:59.049> maxed<00:01:59.350> out<00:01:59.649> horsepower

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
thing's pretty much maxed out horsepower

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.279 
thing's pretty much maxed out horsepower

did that after our last track outing at

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.170 
did that after our last track outing at
Cecil<00:02:55.690> when<00:02:56.200> we<00:02:56.260> went<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.500> 10<00:02:56.710> 20<00:02:57.010> s<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.790> decided

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
Cecil when we went to 10 20 s we decided

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.230 
Cecil when we went to 10 20 s we decided
to<00:02:58.270> get<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> car<00:02:58.660> back<00:02:58.900> onto<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.470> dyno<00:02:59.760> we<00:03:00.760> did

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
to get the car back onto the dyno we did

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.330 
to get the car back onto the dyno we did
change<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.630> fuel<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.800> we<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.100> really

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
change the fuel and we just really

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.370 
change the fuel and we just really
focused<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:03.880> getting<00:03:04.360> every<00:03:04.600> last<00:03:04.780> horsepower

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
focused on getting every last horsepower

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.810 
focused on getting every last horsepower
out<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:05.920> thing<00:03:06.130> when<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.400> were<00:03:06.430> doing<00:03:06.700> our

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
out of this thing when we were doing our

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.670 
out of this thing when we were doing our
tune<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.210> absolutely<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.990> boss<00:03:08.140> manifold

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
tune on it absolutely the boss manifold

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
tune on it absolutely the boss manifold
seem<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.430> solve<00:03:09.760> our<00:03:09.940> nitrous<00:03:10.300> issues<00:03:10.630> right

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
seem to solve our nitrous issues right

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.180 
seem to solve our nitrous issues right
it<00:03:11.020> did<00:03:11.200> yeah<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.410> know<00:03:11.590> after<00:03:11.830> looking<00:03:12.010> at<00:03:12.070> all

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
it did yeah I know after looking at all

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.760 
it did yeah I know after looking at all
the<00:03:12.280> data<00:03:12.400> logs<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> dyno<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:14.230> then

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
the data logs on the dyno and then

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.440 
the data logs on the dyno and then
backing<00:03:14.980> up<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.460> what<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:15.700> saw<00:03:15.850> on<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> track
