00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.130 

so<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> big<00:00:02.730> fan<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.030> pumps<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:03.689> skimmers

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
so I'm a big fan of pumps with skimmers

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.530 
so I'm a big fan of pumps with skimmers
this<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> skimmer<00:00:05.310> it<00:00:05.850> basically<00:00:06.240> fits

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
this is a skimmer it basically fits

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.950 
this is a skimmer it basically fits
inside<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.290> pump<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.830> captures<00:00:08.960> chunks

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
inside of the pump and captures chunks

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.709 
inside of the pump and captures chunks
of<00:00:10.110> debris<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.580> captures<00:00:11.969> snails<00:00:12.360> it

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
of debris and captures snails it

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.049 
of debris and captures snails it
captures<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:14.099> fish<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.580> captures<00:00:14.969> just

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
captures little fish it captures just

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.820 
captures little fish it captures just
about<00:00:15.389> anything<00:00:15.660> big<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> solid<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.710> your

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
about anything big and solid in your

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.310 
about anything big and solid in your
system<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.730> could<00:00:17.940> damage<00:00:18.150> your<00:00:18.449> pump<00:00:18.690> now

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
system that could damage your pump now

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.840 
system that could damage your pump now
most<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.830> pumps<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.310> use<00:00:20.550> these<00:00:20.730> are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
most of the pumps that we use these are

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.560 
most of the pumps that we use these are
pool<00:00:21.060> pumps<00:00:21.480> come<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.529> skimmers<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
pool pumps come with skimmers and I'm a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.359 
pool pumps come with skimmers and I'm a
big<00:00:24.840> advocate<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.500> these<00:00:25.680> types<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.189> pumps

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
big advocate of these types of pumps

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
big advocate of these types of pumps
because<00:00:26.730> they're<00:00:27.119> reliable<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> long

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
because they're reliable in the long

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.570 
because they're reliable in the long
term<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> they're<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:28.680> inexpensive<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
term and they're very inexpensive and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.540 
term and they're very inexpensive and
the<00:00:30.179> fittings<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.320> very<00:00:32.040> easy<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the fittings for them are very easy to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.540 
the fittings for them are very easy to
find<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.739> any<00:00:35.070> spa

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
find so you can go just about any spa

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.240 
find so you can go just about any spa
store<00:00:36.110> or<00:00:37.110> hardware<00:00:37.320> store<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:37.950> find

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
store or hardware store and find

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
store or hardware store and find
fittings<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.210> pumps<00:00:39.570> they're<00:00:39.719> all

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
fittings for these pumps they're all

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.740 
fittings for these pumps they're all
pretty<00:00:39.960> standard<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.570> these

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
pretty standard so I like to use these

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.430 
pretty standard so I like to use these
inline<00:00:43.110> pumps<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.329> you<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:46.110> come<00:00:46.289> with

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
inline pumps and you know they come with

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
inline pumps and you know they come with
skimmers<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.129> occasionally<00:00:47.969> you'll

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
skimmers like this occasionally you'll

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
skimmers like this occasionally you'll
have<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.079> clean<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.190> basically

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have to clean these out so we basically

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.900 
have to clean these out so we basically
just<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:51.360> fit<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.590> pump<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
just they fit in the pump like so and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.610 
just they fit in the pump like so and
they<00:00:54.600> typically<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.710> covering<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
they typically have a covering a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.860 
they typically have a covering a
threaded<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.800> threaded<00:00:59.309> top<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.730> them<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
threaded a threaded top to them that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.330 
threaded a threaded top to them that
allows<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.920> down<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
allows you to kind of see down in the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.060 
allows you to kind of see down in the
pump<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> fits<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.619> there's<00:01:04.949> an

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
pump but it fits on like this there's an

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
pump but it fits on like this there's an
o-ring<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.000> seals<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
o-ring there and it seals and then that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.910 
o-ring there and it seals and then that
collar<00:01:08.450> threads<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.930> basically<00:01:10.500> tightens

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
collar threads on and basically tightens

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.410 
collar threads on and basically tightens
it<00:01:11.010> down<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it down so all you got to do is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020 
it down so all you got to do is
basically<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.290> collar<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> take

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
basically take that collar off and take

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
basically take that collar off and take
off<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> top<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.740> skimmer

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
off the top of your your skimmer

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.450 
off the top of your your skimmer
covering<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.920> take<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.189> skimmer

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
covering here and take out your skimmer

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
covering here and take out your skimmer
and<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.960> gave<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and this one we just kind of gave a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
and this one we just kind of gave a
little<00:01:22.470> rinse<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.939> earlier<00:01:24.330> but

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
little rinse out a little earlier but

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
little rinse out a little earlier but
you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:25.950> clean<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you know you can see it's pretty clean a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
you know you can see it's pretty clean a
lot<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.210> you'll<00:01:27.390> pull<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.689> out

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
lot of the time you'll pull these out

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
lot of the time you'll pull these out
it'll<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.350> full<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.680> gunk<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.210> want

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it'll just be full of gunk so you want

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.550 
it'll just be full of gunk so you want
to<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> hose<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> give<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> good

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
to take the hose and give them a good

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.910 
to take the hose and give them a good
rinse<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> gunk<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
rinse get that gunk out of there and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.899 
rinse get that gunk out of there and
it's<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> improve<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> efficiency<00:01:35.610> of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's going to improve the efficiency of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
it's going to improve the efficiency of
your<00:01:36.000> pump<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> nice<00:01:37.110> thing<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.380> these

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
your pump but the nice thing about these

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
your pump but the nice thing about these
of<00:01:37.860> course<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> prevents<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of course is that it prevents your the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.149 
of course is that it prevents your the
impellers<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.560> pump<00:01:40.770> from<00:01:40.950> being

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
impellers in your pump from being

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.410 
impellers in your pump from being
damaged<00:01:41.640> by<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.210> hard<00:01:43.280> big<00:01:44.280> solid<00:01:45.149> stuff

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
damaged by all this hard big solid stuff

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
damaged by all this hard big solid stuff
going<00:01:45.689> through<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.020> systems<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.790> if<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
going through your systems so if you're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
going through your systems so if you're
thinking<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.270> buying<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.720> pump<00:01:48.960> definitely
