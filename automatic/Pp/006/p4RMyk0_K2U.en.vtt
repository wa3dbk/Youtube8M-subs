00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Have a nice good day we look 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.629
 in this short video just like her 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.940
 in windows call the task manager 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 can order the performance once 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
 monitor your pcs 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.530
 please go directly to the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.509
 taskbar 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.330
 in general, the windows is quite 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.460
 arranged at the bottom and starts at the far left 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 with the windows symbol and stop altogether 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.240
 the right side with the time on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.680
 here only a part of my 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 taskbar in the video 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 therefore you will see the windows symbol 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 time now can not be here with them 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.780
 but it is also that they the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.940
 taskbar times to the right or left 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.129
 You can have it moved up in the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.290
 set windows then please go 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.149
 just with the mouse in the task bar 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.190
 where she is with them 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.300
 click once with the right mouse button 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.789
 in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.219
 then this selection menu opens and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.350
 Click here to start taskmanager 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.199
 then windows opens at them 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.859
 taskmanager mostly in the first one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.469
 rider applications or now here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.239
 me just in the rider performance because I 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.489
 previously called this one 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 had and windows has noticed 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.049
 and opens the task manager for me here 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.310
 again under power 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.799
 here you can see the one now 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.740
 utilization of your actual computer 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.750
 the cpu unit and if its cpu 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.970
 then has several cores, too 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.000
 for each core a small own 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.189
 diagram and front overall how much 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.479
 percent of the computing power 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.159
 is busy 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 below you will find the RAM 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.700
 It is also important here that up here 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.259
 RAM is available if you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.299
 RAM once completely 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.880
 it consumes windows then goes 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.170
 windows over in a so-called 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 paging file that is called windows 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.369
 puts on the hard disk even a 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 area ready as well 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.329
 RAM is used 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.040
 the big disadvantage is that this one 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.229
 Part of the then as memory 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 is used very slowly by the access 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 That is not the long way 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.860
 powerful as the really of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.149
 built-in memory 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 Here they can give to a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.740
 Check to what extent your computer from the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 is used to capacity and for 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.450
 other in how far her memory 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.039
 is consumed that is if you one 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.530
 the values ​​pretty far 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.099
 upper edge goes times over 80 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.200
 percent 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.209
 then your computer is very strong 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.250
 busy and they should check 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.680
 Maybe you have individual applications 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.480
 can close accordingly 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.579
 performance costs so others 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.540
 programs that are just important 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.220
 accordingly can run better yes 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.349
 so much short also task manager 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.310
 maybe a short note to the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.590
 random access memory 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.659
 So if you already have a swap file 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.099
 although it is working memory 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.510
 maybe not complete yet 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.700
 was consumed 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.170
 then maybe it could be that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 a part of your main memory 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.159
 broken is so a stuck one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 Memory modules no longer 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.000
 works one hundred percent and thereby 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.579
 accordingly windows in one 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.439
 then swap out swap file 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.450
 You should do that locally 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.220
 to be checked by a professional 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.260
 because if you do not have memory 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.599
 is completely available 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.129
 very strong on the performance, too 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.470
 on the speed of your computer 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.989
 and applications partially do not work 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.870
 stable or yes maybe support too 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.120
 Just leave this short info here for you 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.329
 also windows taskmanager and the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.870
 your pc's performance all the best from gerald
