00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.100
 these two cars apparently have 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.520
 only one thing in common 200 horses of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.319
 power 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.940
 but beyond the differences also a lot 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.830
 obvious bodywork price of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 mechanics I brought them here on 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 Apennines around happy camp because 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.350
 both have something to do with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.350
 the happiness of those who guide them 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.009
 represent two different ways of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.450
 conceive a sports car 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.070
 if you want they belong to two worlds 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.659
 several front-wheel drive against 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.770
 rear wheel drive and I think the 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.509
 renault clio rs is a great one 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.520
 representative of the category of 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.830
 so bad little front-wheel drive 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.450
 as the toyota gt 86 is the most worthy 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.190
 flag bearer of sporting traction vehicles 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 back but a few seconds you can 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.990
 choose which one to see in 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.880
 this video 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.740
 but before I tell you mine both 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.970
 that of having a very good gift 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 have fun without asking in return 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.070
 too many sacrifices in the life of all 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.930
 days 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.030
 as regards comfort consumption 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.259
 the clio rs while being more normal more 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.759
 similar to the utilities we are 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.710
 get used to and the one that wants to get you 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.630
 to immediately hear a pilot for the controls 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.789
 track gadgets and the ease with which 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.410
 makes its services available but 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.080
 I am a fix of the traction cars 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.340
 rear and with the toyota gta 86 is not 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.230
 just a matter of crossing them 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.610
 driving oversteer means being 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.480
 involved at all times by his 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.220
 reactions 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 through commands designed to put you 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.580
 in communication with all the mechanics 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.799
 and with a set up made for 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.480
 have fun because the road fails 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.250
 seems absurd but the secret of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 fun is all there and for me it is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.680
 fun and better than speed but 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.489
 now 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.489
 you choose
