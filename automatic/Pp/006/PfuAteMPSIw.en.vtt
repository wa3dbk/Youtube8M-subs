00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:37.870 

okay<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.090> start<00:01:33.869> by<00:01:33.990> taking<00:01:36.259> them<00:01:37.259> off

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
okay so I just start by taking them off

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
okay so I just start by taking them off
here<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.270> let's<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.680> left<00:01:43.920> eye

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
here is one and let's do my left eye

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
here is one and let's do my left eye
first<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> make<00:01:45.840> sure<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.290> put<00:01:46.500> on

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
first you have to make sure you put on

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
first you have to make sure you put on
the<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.159> lash<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.060> side<00:01:48.360> because

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the right lash on the right side because

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.469 
the right lash on the right side because
the<00:01:49.500> way<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.189> fit<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.420> eye

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the way that it's gonna fit on your eye

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
the way that it's gonna fit on your eye
is<00:01:51.689> gonna<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.229> different

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
is gonna be different

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.749 
is gonna be different
so<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> stack<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.979> small<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.549> on

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so what I do is I stack the small one on

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.770 
so what I do is I stack the small one on
top<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.270> big<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> should<00:02:01.680> line<00:02:02.009> up

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.860 

like<00:02:06.180> this

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
like this

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.440 
like this
so<00:02:08.470> they<00:02:08.590> sit<00:02:08.920> right<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.640> top<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:10.090> each<00:02:10.300> other

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
so they sit right on top of each other

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.850 
so they sit right on top of each other
like<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:11.730> since<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.940> first<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.860> smaller

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
like that since the first one is smaller

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.730 
like that since the first one is smaller
than<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.820> bottom<00:02:16.000> I'm<00:02:16.450> gonna<00:02:16.600> cut<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.410> bottom

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
than the bottom I'm gonna cut the bottom

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.640 
than the bottom I'm gonna cut the bottom
one<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.390> they<00:02:19.390> line<00:02:19.630> up<00:02:19.810> together<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.560> don't

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
one so they line up together you don't

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.930 
one so they line up together you don't
want<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.250> shorter<00:02:21.640> than<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.850> other

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
want one to be shorter than the other

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.390 
want one to be shorter than the other

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.570 
and that looks really weird so there we
go<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.300> cut<00:02:31.900> them<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.470> they<00:02:32.800> are<00:02:32.830> aligned

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
go I cut them so they are aligned

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:50.130 
go I cut them so they are aligned
together<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:49.090> right<00:02:49.300> one<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.930> have<00:02:50.020> to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
together the right one and you have to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.690 
together the right one and you have to
make<00:02:50.290> sure<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.650> don't<00:02:50.800> lose<00:02:51.040> them<00:02:51.250> sometimes

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
make sure you don't lose them sometimes

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.130 
make sure you don't lose them sometimes
I'm<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:51.970> moving<00:02:52.360> around<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.720> much<00:02:52.870> they<00:02:53.020> get

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
I'm like moving around so much they get

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.199 
I'm like moving around so much they get
caught<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.560> my<00:02:53.680> hair<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.190> when<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:54.850> lose<00:02:55.090> an

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
caught in my hair and when I lose an

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.770 
caught in my hair and when I lose an
eyelash<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.630> panic<00:02:56.200> because<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.310> want<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.330> magic

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
eyelash I panic because I want the magic

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.370 
eyelash I panic because I want the magic
wand<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.350> be<00:02:59.470> found<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:02.380> did<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.070> one

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
wand to be found so I did it to this one

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.270 
wand to be found so I did it to this one
get<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.590> glue<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.640> use<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.690> duo<00:03:08.010> one<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.190> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
get the glue I use the duo one with the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.340 
get the glue I use the duo one with the
brush<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.580> notes<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.940> called<00:03:10.150> dirty<00:03:10.390> but<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.049> use<00:03:11.320> a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
brush I notes I called dirty but I use a

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.940 
brush I notes I called dirty but I use a
duo<00:03:11.680> eyelash<00:03:12.120> glue<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:14.080> one<00:03:14.230> with<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.650> brush

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
duo eyelash glue the one with the brush

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.890 
duo eyelash glue the one with the brush
because<00:03:15.340> it's<00:03:15.700> easier<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:17.400> put<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.120> you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
because it's easier to be put on so you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.500 
because it's easier to be put on so you
just<00:03:20.799> put<00:03:21.070> your<00:03:21.100> eyelash<00:03:21.640> glue<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:23.340> touch<00:03:24.510> like

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
just put your eyelash glue on touch like

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.920 
just put your eyelash glue on touch like
this<00:03:29.790> make<00:03:30.790> sure<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.090> don't<00:03:31.180> put<00:03:31.420> too<00:03:31.630> much<00:03:31.660> on

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
this make sure you don't put too much on

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.330 
this make sure you don't put too much on
because<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.380> know<00:03:32.530> they'll<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:32.739> take<00:03:33.100> forever

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
because I know they'll just take forever

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.509 
because I know they'll just take forever
to<00:03:33.640> dry<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:35.200> dries<00:03:35.530> clear<00:03:35.769> notes<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.340> looks

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
to dry it dries clear notes it looks

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.800 
to dry it dries clear notes it looks
white<00:03:36.700> right<00:03:36.970> now<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.239> it<00:03:37.329> dries<00:03:37.480> clear<00:03:37.690> so

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
white right now but it dries clear so

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.390 
white right now but it dries clear so
like<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.290> much<00:03:39.480> blow<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.900> little<00:03:41.079> bit

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
like that much blow on it a little bit

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.920
