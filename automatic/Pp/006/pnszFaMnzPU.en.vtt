00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.870 
on the side and the old ones were
humongous<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> had<00:02:14.890> bad<00:02:15.100> peripheral<00:02:15.610> vision

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
humongous so I had bad peripheral vision

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.720 
humongous so I had bad peripheral vision
for<00:02:16.120> driving<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.590> new<00:02:18.069> ones<00:02:18.280> have<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.520> nice

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
for driving the new ones have a nice

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.810 
for driving the new ones have a nice
little<00:02:18.910> gap<00:02:19.239> right<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.680> seeing<00:02:21.489> out<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
little gap right here for seeing out the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.780 
little gap right here for seeing out the
side<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.330> they're<00:02:22.570> much<00:02:22.780> thinner<00:02:23.080> along<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
side and they're much thinner along the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.710 
side and they're much thinner along the
edge<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.050> look<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.260> on
