ago<00:02:19.140> do<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.330> Jeff<00:02:21.540> Hardy's<00:02:21.870> going

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
ago do I think that Jeff Hardy's going

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
ago do I think that Jeff Hardy's going
to<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.319> leaving<00:02:22.530> TNA<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> next<00:02:23.730> little

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
to be leaving TNA in the next little

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
to be leaving TNA in the next little
while<00:02:24.209> no<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.380> think<00:02:25.620> Jeff<00:02:25.800> Hardy's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
while no but I think Jeff Hardy's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.910 
while no but I think Jeff Hardy's
probably<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.640> atop<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.150> list<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.540> guys<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
probably have atop the list of guys that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.610 
probably have atop the list of guys that
TNA<00:02:28.920> wants<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> keep<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.880> TNA<00:02:30.410> doesn't<00:02:31.410> want<00:02:31.530> to

TNA wants to keep at TNA doesn't want to

Eric Bischoff's could walk out there and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.610 
Eric Bischoff's could walk out there and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
than likely not on the back of the day

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.120 
than likely not on the back of the day
this<00:03:00.720> was<00:03:00.930> during<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.260> Monday<00:03:01.410> night<00:03:01.590> worse<00:03:01.860> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
this was during the Monday night worse I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.130 
this was during the Monday night worse I
think<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.580> there<00:03:02.940> would<00:03:03.120> be<00:03:03.150> without<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
think that there would be without a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.740 
think that there would be without a
doubt<00:03:04.410> would<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.100> signed<00:03:05.340> him<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.269> TNA

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
doubt would have signed him just so TNA

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.809 
doubt would have signed him just so TNA
couldn't<00:03:07.319> have<00:03:07.410> had<00:03:07.590> him<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.160> don't<00:03:08.489> think<00:03:08.550> it

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
couldn't have had him I don't think it

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.870 
couldn't have had him I don't think it
that<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.510> think<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.530> Debbie<00:03:11.250> did<00:03:11.459> sign<00:03:11.730> them

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
that if I think if Debbie did sign them

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.790 
that if I think if Debbie did sign them
and<00:03:11.940> put<00:03:12.150> them<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.300> Monday<00:03:12.540> Night<00:03:12.720> Raw<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.200> think

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
and put them on Monday Night Raw I think

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.860 
and put them on Monday Night Raw I think
that<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.190> would<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.489> big<00:03:15.060> reaction<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
that it would be a big reaction that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.620 
that it would be a big reaction that
would<00:03:15.989> ripple<00:03:16.230> through<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.040> wrestling

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
would ripple through the the wrestling

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.240 
would ripple through the the wrestling
Twitter<00:03:18.630> pages<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.230> everybody's<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.829> posting

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
Twitter pages and everybody's be posting

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.740 
Twitter pages and everybody's be posting
on<00:03:20.459> Facebook<00:03:20.880> everything<00:03:21.209> like<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
on Facebook everything like that but I

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.720 
on Facebook everything like that but I
think<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.019> after<00:03:22.560> he<00:03:22.950> has<00:03:23.070> his<00:03:23.250> initial

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
think that after he has his initial

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.460 
think that after he has his initial
debut<00:03:24.239> whatever<00:03:24.630> they<00:03:24.720> would<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:25.019> with<00:03:25.170> them<00:03:25.320> I

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
debut whatever they would do with them I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.289 
debut whatever they would do with them I
think<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.130> honestly<00:03:26.250> by<00:03:26.610> Royal<00:03:26.880> Rumble

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
think that honestly by Royal Rumble

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.449 
think that honestly by Royal Rumble
especially<00:03:27.750> about<00:03:27.840> WrestleMania<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.680> AJ

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
especially about WrestleMania time AJ

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.009 
especially about WrestleMania time AJ
would<00:03:29.610> just<00:03:29.850> be<00:03:29.970> sort<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.390> guy<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.930> they

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
would just be sort of a guy that they

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.509 
would just be sort of a guy that they
would<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.320> under<00:03:31.560> contract<00:03:32.070> much<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.400> if

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
would have under contract much like if

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.460 
would have under contract much like if
you<00:03:32.610> look<00:03:32.760> at<00:03:32.910> Christian<00:03:33.420> or<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.200> look<00:03:34.350> at

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
Berta's clay over as a heel do I think

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.509 
Berta's clay over as a heel do I think
that<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.230> end<00:03:55.260> maybe<00:03:55.680> Xavier<00:03:56.130> might<00:03:56.310> get

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
that in the end maybe Xavier might get

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.940 
that in the end maybe Xavier might get
one<00:03:56.790> win<00:03:57.060> over<00:03:57.390> Brodus<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:58.019> it'll<00:03:58.500> shock<00:03:58.769> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
one win over Brodus that it'll shock the

it's not like he said be going on doing
that<00:04:13.890> um<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:15.209> know<00:04:15.299> Jeff<00:04:15.540> Hardy<00:04:15.870> more<00:04:16.079> than

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
that um you know Jeff Hardy more than

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.630 
that um you know Jeff Hardy more than
likely<00:04:16.320> i<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.769> gonna<00:04:16.890> keep<00:04:17.190> rustling

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
likely i think is gonna keep rustling

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.180 
likely i think is gonna keep rustling
for<00:04:17.880> TNA<00:04:18.239> he's<00:04:18.750> got<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.019> deal<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.650> believe<00:04:19.979> it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
for TNA he's got a deal I believe it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.520 
for TNA he's got a deal I believe it
that<00:04:20.370> that's<00:04:20.640> through<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.000> next

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that that's through the next

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.820 
that that's through the next
uh<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:22.220> know<00:04:22.280> next<00:04:22.820> year<00:04:22.970> in<00:04:23.210> 2015<00:04:23.900> which

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
uh you know next year in 2015 which

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.110 
uh you know next year in 2015 which
means<00:04:25.070> he<00:04:25.160> wouldn't<00:04:25.400> be<00:04:25.460> able<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.639> jump<00:04:25.910> till

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
means he wouldn't be able to jump till

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.070 
means he wouldn't be able to jump till
right<00:04:26.300> before<00:04:26.360> WrestleMania<00:04:27.260> 31<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:29.050> but<00:04:30.050> I

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
right before WrestleMania 31 on but I

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.320 
right before WrestleMania 31 on but I
think<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.500> definitely<00:04:30.710> if<00:04:31.669> he<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.120> sit

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
think that definitely if he is to sit

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.850 
think that definitely if he is to sit
down<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.660> taught<00:04:32.900> at<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.320> table<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.710> try<00:04:33.770> to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
down and taught at the table and try to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.520 
down and taught at the table and try to
retox<00:04:34.310> his<00:04:35.270> contract<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:35.930> get<00:04:36.020> an<00:04:36.139> extension

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
retox his contract and get an extension

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.530 
retox his contract and get an extension
with<00:04:36.800> TNA<00:04:37.160> I<00:04:37.190> think<00:04:37.490> easy<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.910> run<00:04:38.210> into<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
with TNA I think easy to run into the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.060 
with TNA I think easy to run into the
same<00:04:38.690> problem<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.110> AJ<00:04:39.470> had<00:04:39.680> where<00:04:39.889> they<00:04:40.010> are

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
same problem that AJ had where they are

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.280 
same problem that AJ had where they are
trying<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.490> cut<00:04:40.760> costs<00:04:41.240> more<00:04:41.810> than<00:04:41.960> likely<00:04:42.139> i

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
trying to cut costs more than likely i

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.720 
trying to cut costs more than likely i
would<00:04:42.440> say<00:04:42.680> that<00:04:42.710> Jeff<00:04:43.010> Hardy<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.340> probably

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
would say that Jeff Hardy is probably
