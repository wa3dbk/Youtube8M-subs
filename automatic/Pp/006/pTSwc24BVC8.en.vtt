i'm going to be doing the ocean and we
decided<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.270> do<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.480> because<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:07.049> have

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
decided to do this because we have

decided to do this because we have
channels<00:00:07.620> are<00:00:07.740> relatively<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> same<00:00:08.400> size

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and subscribers so we thought we would

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.049 
and subscribers so we thought we would
both<00:00:10.710> benefit<00:00:11.190> from<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.460> little<00:00:11.490> more<00:00:11.759> exposure

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
both benefit from a little more exposure

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.459 
both benefit from a little more exposure
from<00:00:12.240> each<00:00:12.420> other's<00:00:12.690> channels<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> help
