7 8 9 C 3 &amp; 9 zeros and just go okay and

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.300 
7 8 9 C 3 &amp; 9 zeros and just go okay and
make<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> new<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.909> D<00:01:50.909> word<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.860> call<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> max

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
make a new one D word and call it max

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.340 
make a new one D word and call it max
connection

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.430 

per<00:02:00.670> one<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.810> score<00:02:03.220> zero<00:02:04.220> server<00:02:05.140> okay<00:02:06.140> so

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
per one on the score zero server okay so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.859 
per one on the score zero server okay so
that's<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.710> little<00:02:06.890> different<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:08.060> make<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.479> max

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
that's a little different so make it max

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.840 
that's a little different so make it max
connection<00:02:09.500> per<00:02:09.740> one<00:02:10.039> on<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> scores<00:02:10.670> your

server right click your modify which is

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.449 
server right click your modify which is
decimal<00:02:14.720> again<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> same<00:02:15.440> thing<00:02:15.650> it's

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
decimal again and the same thing it's

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.730 
decimal again and the same thing it's
three<00:02:16.730> with<00:02:16.910> nine<00:02:17.090> zeroes<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:20.080> he<00:02:21.080> okay<00:02:21.560> make

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
three with nine zeroes and he okay make

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.550 
three with nine zeroes and he okay make
sure<00:02:21.770> he<00:02:22.010> okay<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.209> go<00:02:23.600> hit<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> five

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
sure he okay and then just go hit a five

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.949 
sure he okay and then just go hit a five
so<00:02:25.100> just<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.430> refreshing<00:02:25.820> everything<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.510> then

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
so just a refreshing everything and then
