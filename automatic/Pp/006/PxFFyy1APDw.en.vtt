00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.980 
fora tv' the world is thinking my
favorite<00:00:08.460> part<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.179> chip<00:00:09.389> genome<00:00:09.750> paper

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
favorite part of the chip genome paper

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.169 
favorite part of the chip genome paper
was<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> little<00:00:11.280> table<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.880> don't<00:00:11.940> think<00:00:12.030> it

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
was a little table and I don't think it

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.610 
was a little table and I don't think it
was<00:00:12.240> everybody<00:00:12.570> else's<00:00:12.840> favorite<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.440> it

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
was everybody else's favorite because it

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740 
was everybody else's favorite because it
was<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:14.070> next<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.969> last<00:00:15.150> page<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
was on like next to last page of the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.769 
was on like next to last page of the
paper<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.410> my<00:00:17.310> favorite<00:00:17.699> part<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.600> little

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
paper but my favorite part was a little

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.150 
paper but my favorite part was a little
table<00:00:19.580> in<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:22.260> listed<00:00:22.680> 15<00:00:23.189> genes<00:00:23.900> where

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
table in which we listed 15 genes where

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
table in which we listed 15 genes where
the<00:00:26.160> gene<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.609> associated<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> human

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the gene was associated with a human

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.109 
the gene was associated with a human
disease<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.730> genes

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
disease so we know that that genes

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
disease so we know that that genes
involved<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.900> creating<00:00:31.439> disease<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.070> humans

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
involved in creating disease and humans

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
involved in creating disease and humans
and<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.390> humans<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> disease<00:00:34.410> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and not all humans get the disease so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
and not all humans get the disease so
common<00:00:35.100> diseases<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.700> diseases<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.210> don't

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
common diseases but diseases that don't

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.080 
common diseases but diseases that don't
occur<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.430> commonly<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:38.969> people

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
occur and that commonly so some people

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.720 
occur and that commonly so some people
get<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.809> people<00:00:39.840> don't<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.730> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
get them and some people don't and that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
get them and some people don't and that
there's<00:00:42.420> evidence<00:00:42.719> people<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.500> already

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
there's evidence people have already

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
there's evidence people have already
done<00:00:43.860> individual<00:00:44.610> studies<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.329> genes

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
done individual studies of these genes

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.389 
done individual studies of these genes
and<00:00:45.989> shown<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.879> chimp<00:00:48.360> version<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.399> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and shown that the chimp version is the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.880 
and shown that the chimp version is the
one<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.879> creates<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> disease<00:00:52.110> state<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.770> in

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
one that creates the disease state so in

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
one that creates the disease state so in
other<00:00:52.980> words<00:00:53.219> they're<00:00:53.489> humans<00:00:54.000> walking

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
other words they're humans walking

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.729 
other words they're humans walking
around<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> earth<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.559> have

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
around the earth and some of them have

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979 
around the earth and some of them have
the<00:00:55.980> human<00:00:56.309> version<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.969> new<00:00:57.180> human<00:00:57.809> version

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the human version the new human version

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
the human version the new human version
and<00:00:58.320> some<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> ancestral

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and some of them have the ancestral

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.069 
and some of them have the ancestral
version<00:00:59.940> which<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> could<00:01:00.480> call<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> chimp

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
version which you could call the chimp

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.540 
version which you could call the chimp
version<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> key<00:01:02.399> those

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
version it's not that the key those

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.990 
version it's not that the key those
humans<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:03.030> chimps<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
humans are chimps but that they have a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.940 
humans are chimps but that they have a
version<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.780> works<00:01:06.930> fine<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> chin<00:01:07.770> but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
version that works fine and chin but

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
version that works fine and chin but
works<00:01:08.130> fine<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.580> our<00:01:08.670> ancestors<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.689> probably

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
works fine in our ancestors it probably

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
works fine in our ancestors it probably
works<00:01:10.200> fine<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.650> mice<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.830> other<00:01:11.159> mammals

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
works fine and mice and other mammals

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
works fine and mice and other mammals
but<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.960> some<00:01:13.140> reason<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> human

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
but for some reason in the human

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090 
but for some reason in the human
population<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.450> new<00:01:15.780> variant<00:01:16.229> has<00:01:16.470> arisen<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
population a new variant has arisen and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.679 
population a new variant has arisen and
it's<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.580> healthier<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> new

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it's actually healthier to have the new

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's actually healthier to have the new
one<00:01:18.900> compared<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> old<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
one compared to the old one and that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
one compared to the old one and that's
probably<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.500> something's<00:01:22.500> changed<00:01:23.040> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
probably because something's changed in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.630 
probably because something's changed in
our<00:01:23.549> environment<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.450> lifestyle<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:26.369> some

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
our environment our lifestyle or in some

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
our environment our lifestyle or in some
other<00:01:26.790> place<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> genome<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.350> makes

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
other place in the genome that now makes

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
other place in the genome that now makes
it<00:01:28.829> better<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.150> new<00:01:30.450> version<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it better to have this new version and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
it better to have this new version and
while<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.070> hard<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.369> nail<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> head

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
while it's hard to nail them on the head

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
while it's hard to nail them on the head
and<00:01:33.390> say<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> definitely<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.560> Darwin

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and say this is definitely what Darwin

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
and say this is definitely what Darwin
was<00:01:35.070> thinking<00:01:35.400> about<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:36.299> positive

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
was thinking about with positive

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
was thinking about with positive
selection<00:01:37.310> we're<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.490> sure<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.880> new<00:01:39.090> one

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
selection we're pretty sure this new one

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
selection we're pretty sure this new one
arose<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.380> pretty<00:01:40.590> high

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
arose and that it's at pretty high

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.020 
arose and that it's at pretty high
frequency<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> human<00:01:41.880> population

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
frequency in the human population

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
frequency in the human population
because<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.780> beneficial<00:01:43.159> well<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because it's beneficial well it's a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
because it's beneficial well it's a
little<00:01:44.549> bit<00:01:44.670> hard<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> nail<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> exactly

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
little bit hard to nail that exactly

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
little bit hard to nail that exactly
it's<00:01:47.100> pretty<00:01:47.430> obvious<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> that's<00:01:48.149> probably

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it's pretty obvious that that's probably

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's pretty obvious that that's probably
what's<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.409> these<00:01:49.560> 15<00:01:49.979> genes<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
what's going on with these 15 genes so

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
what's going on with these 15 genes so
we're<00:01:50.970> evolving<00:01:51.329> away<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.350> state<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
we're evolving away from a state that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
we're evolving away from a state that
used<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.430> fine<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.630> healthy

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
used to be fine and it's now not healthy

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
used to be fine and it's now not healthy
because<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.649> something<00:01:55.950> else<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.250> changed

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
because of something else that's changed

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.359 
because of something else that's changed
around<00:01:57.000> us<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.719> think<00:01:58.560> those<00:01:58.829> are<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:01:59.130> cool

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
around us I think those are pretty cool

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.719 
around us I think those are pretty cool
stories<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.170> there's<00:02:01.170> only<00:02:01.409> 15<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> them<00:02:02.579> in

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
stories and there's only 15 of them in

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
stories and there's only 15 of them in
this<00:02:02.790> table<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.509> I'm<00:02:03.659> pretty<00:02:03.840> sure<00:02:04.049> there's

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
this table but I'm pretty sure there's

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.740 
this table but I'm pretty sure there's
probably<00:02:04.409> some<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.969> genome<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
probably some more in the genome and the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
probably some more in the genome and the
reason<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.140> only<00:02:07.259> 15<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.860> there's<00:02:08.009> only

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
reason there's only 15 is there's only

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.430 
reason there's only 15 is there's only
15<00:02:08.520> cases<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.660> nail<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
15 cases we really can nail that the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.559 
15 cases we really can nail that the
gene<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.979> involved<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> disease<00:02:11.910> there's

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
gene is involved in the disease there's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.790 
gene is involved in the disease there's
a<00:02:12.660> lot<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> other<00:02:13.020> examples<00:02:13.379> where

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
a lot of other examples where

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
a lot of other examples where
humans<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.550> evolving<00:02:14.640> away<00:02:15.090> from<00:02:15.420> an

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
humans are evolving away from an

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.760 
humans are evolving away from an
ancestral<00:02:15.840> version<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.620> know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
ancestral version and we just don't know

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.000 
ancestral version and we just don't know
what<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> consequences<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.760> yet
