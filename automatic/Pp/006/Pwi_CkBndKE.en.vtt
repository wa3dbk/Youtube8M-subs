sets out overnight I'm gonna apply it to
the<00:03:29.110> hole<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.590> then<00:03:30.010> we'll<00:03:30.040> take<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> limit<00:03:31.269> it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
the hole and then we'll take a limit it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.170 
the hole and then we'll take a limit it
looks<00:03:31.570> like<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.950> hole<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.280> completely

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
looks like so the hole is completely

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.210

finished as dry and I've applied it and
it's<00:03:37.090> very<00:03:37.150> tricky<00:03:37.570> applying<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.320> because

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
it's very tricky applying it because

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.920 
it's very tricky applying it because
that<00:03:38.739> adhesive<00:03:39.280> tape<00:03:39.489> is<00:03:39.640> very<00:03:39.670> very<00:03:40.540> sticky

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
that adhesive tape is very very sticky

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.360 
that adhesive tape is very very sticky
so<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.290> have<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.560> put<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.830> off<00:03:41.920> very<00:03:42.070> carefully

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
so you have to put it off very carefully

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.940 
so you have to put it off very carefully
because<00:03:42.730> basically<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:44.019> only<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:44.440> one<00:03:44.680> shot

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
because basically you only have one shot

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.940 
because basically you only have one shot
at<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.400> two<00:03:45.760> at<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.090> most<00:03:46.269> but<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:47.079> be

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
at it two at the most but you just be

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.590 
at it two at the most but you just be
very<00:03:48.190> careful<00:03:48.579> when<00:03:48.670> you're<00:03:48.790> applying<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
very careful when you're applying it and

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.500 
very careful when you're applying it and
the<00:03:50.560> flip<00:03:51.010> flop<00:03:51.340> paint<00:03:51.670> has<00:03:52.090> come<00:03:52.360> in

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
the flip flop paint has come in

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.539 
the flip flop paint has come in
wonderfully<00:03:53.110> here<00:03:53.590> from<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.860> angle<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.280> can

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
wonderfully here from this angle you can

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.699 
wonderfully here from this angle you can
see<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:55.420> different<00:03:55.750> colors<00:03:56.079> pop<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.620> we'll

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
see the different colors pop and we'll

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.110 
see the different colors pop and we'll
rotate<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.160> around<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.519> little<00:03:57.610> bit<00:03:57.760> as<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.060> can

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
rotate it around a little bit as you can

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.470 
rotate it around a little bit as you can
see<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.630> kind<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:59.459> changes<00:04:00.459> we<00:04:00.640> swirl<00:04:01.180> it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
see it just kind of changes we swirl it

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800 
see it just kind of changes we swirl it
so<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:03.459> is<00:04:03.670> awesome<00:04:03.820> I'm<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:04.360> happy<00:04:04.690> with

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
so that is awesome I'm very happy with

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.319 
so that is awesome I'm very happy with
the<00:04:04.930> finish<00:04:05.200> result<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.880> I'll<00:04:06.970> do<00:04:07.150> these

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
the finish result I think I'll do these

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.789 
the finish result I think I'll do these
and<00:04:07.570> I'll<00:04:07.630> probably<00:04:07.870> sell<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.230> few<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:08.709> if

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
and I'll probably sell a few so if

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.590
