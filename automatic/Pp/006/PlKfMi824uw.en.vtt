00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
which at first I thought was kind of

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
which at first I thought was kind of
useless<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.390> I've<00:01:48.689> always<00:01:48.899> been<00:01:49.049> able<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
useless because I've always been able to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
useless because I've always been able to
take<00:01:49.799> pictures<00:01:50.250> without<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.909> tilting<00:01:51.390> screen

take pictures without a tilting screen
but<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.229> honest<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.860> came<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.310> handy<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
but to be honest it came in handy in a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
but to be honest it came in handy in a
lot<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.210> circumstances<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> wanted<00:01:55.799> to

display tilted towards me the only

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310

complaint<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
complaint that I have about it is that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.780 
complaint that I have about it is that
it's<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.799> stiff<00:02:05.130> when<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> want<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it's a little stiff when you want to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.819 
it's a little stiff when you want to
make<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> face<00:02:06.360> down<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:07.140> you'll<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.409> used<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
make it face down but you'll get used to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
make it face down but you'll get used to
it<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.250> next<00:02:08.580> thing<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.819> want<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> talk<00:02:09.270> about

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it the next thing I want to talk about

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.720 
it the next thing I want to talk about
is<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.080> manual<00:02:10.619> focus<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
is the manual focus if you want to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.650 
is the manual focus if you want to
manual<00:02:12.120> focus<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.050> hold

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
manual focus you have to hold

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.230 
manual focus you have to hold
the<00:02:13.900> autofocus<00:02:14.590> button<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.040> let<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.730> camera

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
the autofocus button and let the camera

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.330 
the autofocus button and let the camera
focus<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.990> then<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.620> use<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> manual

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
focus and then you can use the manual

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.070 
focus and then you can use the manual
focus<00:02:18.760> which<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.000> must<00:02:19.270> say<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.570> quite

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
focus which I must say is quite

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.120 
focus which I must say is quite
uncomfortable

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
uncomfortable

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.550 
uncomfortable
however<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.640> autofocus<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.600> very<00:02:22.930> fast<00:02:23.380> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
however the autofocus is very fast and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.950 
however the autofocus is very fast and
accurate<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.280> manual<00:02:24.670> focus<00:02:25.060> isn't<00:02:25.240> necessary

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
accurate so manual focus isn't necessary

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.900 
accurate so manual focus isn't necessary

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
mention in the review is that the camera

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.370
