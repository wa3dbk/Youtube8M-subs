 on the way creates and muffler on 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 key so it looks like but 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.160
 initially drone ehec with whom I drone 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.030
 of course no kill can do that and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 I 've reached 50 here is actually 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.670
 relatively much for something before but people 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 makes you not worry about going through 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.550
 really do not worry i have two three 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.579
 gameplay ability merkels achieved 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.350
 I and a higher fully in whom I 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.500
 I'm on the verge of a dna bomb twice 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 died today the fucking hell svf 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.030
 but good moment I have one 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 a 28 trick and what happens to people what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 the devil happens I only see 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.150
 ten seconds on the screen to me 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 I run nobody think I only had 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.490
 a minute at the end only a minute 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.009
 i had a 22 or so i'm around 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689
 my life ran my heart 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.950
 can not imagine my duke 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.720
 at the bmbf very dry biedermann me 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.320
 I got the circulation 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 but less good people come down to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.869
 I have to say he is gameplay 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.270
 Actually, I'm pretty handsome 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.820
 one of the most offensive play i am not 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 so the camper or so especially small 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.390
 roof chamber though I have to say that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.210
 go this one way or the other up there 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.310
 you squint but that's just why 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 I rarely say that when I'm up there 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.469
 i 'm good people i have to say the ak 12 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 is something of cool especially with sharp 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.710
 and silencers I will soon 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.159
 probably also a class setup 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.610
 do 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.730
 So I already have 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.479
 real horny classes must connect here 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.390
 I say 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.270
 and if you want to see it, leave it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.570
 I know it writes under the video 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.940
 In any case, an ice would be good of you 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.040
 What I have to say is that that 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.260
 gameplay here on the psv was earned 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.350
 and that is not my idea or how 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.220
 I also like to say it 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.840
 the xbox fanboy will go with the ps4 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.580
 probably also to lay but must 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.620
 I'll just take a look at mine 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.450
 older brother has lent me 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.180
 people you think may I have 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.640
 something warfali I bought did it 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.640
 Actually, I really wanted to 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.489
 my brother thought tesco 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.370
 this tesco has no call of duty 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.970
 Clear all he has left me 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.450
 looked at and what is ps4 before mine 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.180
 nose 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.480
 call of duty advance before your game 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.430
 and picture your opinion that went up 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.450
 the game is horny or shit and 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.989
 People 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.450
 I have to confess I have something for you 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.560
 confidant I'm addicted right now 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.530
 become 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 dg it definitely makes me so bock 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.120
 definitely have the old one 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.890
 call of duty feeling that feeling people 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.150
 this fight back in with i know 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.580
 not why i have again 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.530
 I'm really in the mood for it again 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.860
 fight again right you know 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.480
 and that means more for you, of course 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.610
 videos fifa I think it is actually 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.350
 relatively little to come but hardly 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.510
 I think the election will eventually 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.840
 but occasionally come call of duty 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.480
 of course a lot more good people mw said 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.900
 I have a lot more in any case 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.739
 Gameplays at the start and you will 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.709
 see you soon 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.660
 i also had on instinct game mode 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.470
 a blatant live with domination 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.350
 comments have been made but me 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.980
 I thought okay that the first call 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.070
 designed by duty as you can on yours 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.540
 if that arrives so well I was there 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.330
 Unnormal at cursing people you can 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.100
 believe me quietly and I thought so 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.229
 such an eternal you are so blatant 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.880
 curse 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.770
 it just can not be done that's easy 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.430
 did not comply with the gave 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:39.729
 Do you know what does that matter what you do in this 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 video saxony is not all video 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.510
 clear but good this gameplays too 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.699
 not bad that was more kills 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.900
 but only had good there 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.039
 Paladin reached and the other whole 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.169
 killstreaks So since I have to 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:57.639
 Killstreaks played there 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.889
 of course merkels but good people so much 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.400
 first, and of course I wanted 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.669
 also your opinion to play listening to find 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.190
 many flamen is yes i have it 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.199
 of course also clarified or flame is 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.930
 but still at the same time I think it is 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.449
 customer is just a bit strange but 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.789
 was always just like love call of 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.940
 Duty and let's just die 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:25.289
 it was always like this and in this game 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.060
 push we are then somehow on 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.930
 no idea something was natural to us 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.099
 do not like it but well describes it 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.979
 me in any case down in the 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.680
 comments on how you find the game and 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.539
 if you find shit also write 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.010
 below in the comments why and when 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.680
 you find it cool writes too 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.250
 also and in comments why niesky 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.229
 With 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.780
 So in the end, I have to say that 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.789
 think it's cool 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.880
 getting used to clearly there 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:59.620
 also holds the classic cd trails 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.370
 not anymore so it is completely different 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.030
 become 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.770
 walkways as in mw2 m w3b o2 gibbs even 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.789
 not so good 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.740
 Let's see that in the next one 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.780
 time will be 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.000
 I think 100 plus gameplay is already 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.919
 Honestly to 100 plus gameplay is 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.729
 I think that possible I think so 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.249
 not so 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:25.089
 So I already have , I can already do that 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:26.830
 very close to it I say so and maybe 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:30.039
 will you soon be 100 plus 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.379
 gameplay see age good people yes that 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.879
 Gameplay tends to rate the end 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.710
 The comment I remember 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.210
 I would definitely be happy and 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.680
 I would definitely say that up 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.680
 next time people go in 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.319
 bonus earned well
