00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
it's probably a better idea the question

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's probably a better idea the question
one<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.090> don't<00:02:16.210> know<00:02:16.390> tell<00:02:16.780> me<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.930> guys<00:02:17.110> feel<00:02:17.410> we
