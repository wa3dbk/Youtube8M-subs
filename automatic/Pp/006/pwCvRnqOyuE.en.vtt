00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and got something more valuable like a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
and got something more valuable like a
menu<00:01:29.220> change<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:30.119> something<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> four<00:01:31.259> point

2007<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:34.790> 2006<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> PlayStation<00:01:36.450> first

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
2007 or 2006 and the PlayStation first

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.130 
2007 or 2006 and the PlayStation first
came<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:39.180> whole<00:01:39.540> thing<00:01:39.930> being

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
came out so with this whole thing being

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
came out so with this whole thing being
just<00:01:40.380> stale<00:01:40.820> I'm<00:01:41.820> starting<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.210> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
just stale I'm starting to think that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.429 
just stale I'm starting to think that
somebody's<00:01:42.689> getting<00:01:42.869> lazy<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.290> their

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
somebody's getting lazy with their

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.899 
somebody's getting lazy with their
updates<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.920> mean<00:01:44.100> whenever<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.850> an

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
updates I mean whenever we do get an

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.950 
updates I mean whenever we do get an
update<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.450> probably<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
update now it's probably just like a
