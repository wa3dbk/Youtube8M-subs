hair about that big and wrapping the
wand<00:01:36.479> around<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.110> I'll<00:01:37.290> show<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.740> long

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
wand around and I'll show you how long

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
wand around and I'll show you how long
it<00:01:38.189> takes<00:01:38.430> when<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> still<00:01:39.720> warming

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it takes when the one is still warming

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
it takes when the one is still warming
up<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> keep<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> longer<00:01:41.579> side

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
up I kind of keep it on the longer side

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850 
up I kind of keep it on the longer side
but<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> usually<00:01:42.540> keep<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.229> between<00:01:43.409> 10

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
but I usually keep it there between 10

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.460 
but I usually keep it there between 10
and<00:01:43.890> 20<00:01:44.399> seconds<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.049> heats<00:01:46.290> up

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and 20 seconds but as the one heats up

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.679 
and 20 seconds but as the one heats up
you'll<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.100> gets<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.850> quick<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.390> towards

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you'll see it gets so quick so towards

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
you'll see it gets so quick so towards
the<00:01:48.810> end<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.110> takes<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.560> lot<00:01:49.710> less<00:01:49.829> time<00:01:50.070> but

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the end it takes a lot less time but

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.330 
the end it takes a lot less time but
yeah<00:01:50.729> there's<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.329> curl

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
yeah there's the first curl

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.340 
yeah there's the first curl
and<00:01:52.430> you're<00:01:53.060> just<00:01:53.240> gonna<00:01:53.329> keep<00:01:53.570> curling<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
and you're just gonna keep curling the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
see already that this curl took way last

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.700 
see already that this curl took way last
time<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.290> gonna<00:03:07.440> show<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.620> the

time so then I'm not gonna show you the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.050 
time so then I'm not gonna show you the
whole<00:03:07.890> head<00:03:08.070> cuz<00:03:08.280> it'll<00:03:08.460> take<00:03:08.670> forever<00:03:08.790> but

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
whole head cuz it'll take forever but

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.760 
whole head cuz it'll take forever but
then<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:09.960> you're<00:03:10.080> done<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.380> each<00:03:10.530> layer

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
then when you're done with each layer

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.270 
then when you're done with each layer
spray<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.580> do<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> same<00:03:12.000> method<00:03:12.270> and

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
spray it and do the same method and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.610 
spray it and do the same method and
again<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:18.330> make<00:03:18.780> sure<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.020> look<00:03:19.200> in<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.440> back

again and make sure you look in the back

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.260 
again and make sure you look in the back
because<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.070> always<00:03:20.370> tend<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.730> forget<00:03:20.880> pieces

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
because I always tend to forget pieces

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.820 
because I always tend to forget pieces
in<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> back<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.930> check<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.470> back<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.740> your

head<00:03:23.570> for<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> very<00:03:24.960> top<00:03:25.230> layer<00:03:25.440> once<00:03:25.740> you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
head for the very top layer once you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.590 
head for the very top layer once you
finally<00:03:26.250> get<00:03:26.400> there<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.640> fast-forwarded<00:03:27.090> I

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
finally get there I fast-forwarded I

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.150 
finally get there I fast-forwarded I
brush<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:28.800> usually<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
brush it a little because it's usually a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.280 
brush it a little because it's usually a
little<00:03:29.430> wonky<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:30.030> brush<00:03:30.570> out<00:03:30.720> anything<00:03:31.140> that

got<00:03:31.440> messed<00:03:31.680> up<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.970> want<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.239> curl

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
got messed up and then you want to curl
