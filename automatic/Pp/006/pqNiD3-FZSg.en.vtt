00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
and also light the room up so we can

and also light the room up so we can
actually<00:03:32.799> see<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.160> we're<00:03:33.280> doing<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:34.769> just

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
actually see what we're doing I just

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.199 
actually see what we're doing I just
want<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.130> make<00:03:36.220> sure<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.549> they<00:03:36.670> perish<00:03:37.060> your

want to make sure that they perish your
foot<00:03:37.389> against<00:03:37.660> me

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.080 

we'll<00:03:56.060> be<00:03:56.240> like<00:03:56.390> what<00:03:56.600> up<00:03:56.630> dude<00:03:57.760> he<00:03:58.760> must<00:03:58.940> be

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
we'll be like what up dude he must be

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.890 
we'll be like what up dude he must be
over<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.420> I<00:04:01.810> can't<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:02.930> him<00:04:04.690> he's<00:04:05.690> around

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
over here I can't see him he's around

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.860 
over here I can't see him he's around
here<00:04:06.080> somewhere<00:04:06.350> though

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
here somewhere though

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:22.740 
here somewhere though
is<00:04:08.349> he<00:04:08.500> stuck

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.980 

the<00:04:23.750> areas<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.140> could<00:04:24.200> see<00:04:24.470> math<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.770> over<00:04:25.040> here

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.250 

okay

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
okay

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.460 
okay
so<00:04:31.160> anyway<00:04:31.400> that's<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.640> last<00:04:31.700> guy<00:04:32.380> we<00:04:33.380> don't

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
so anyway that's the last guy we don't

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.110 
so anyway that's the last guy we don't
worry<00:04:33.740> about<00:04:33.800> them<00:04:34.010> anymore<00:04:34.070> but<00:04:34.970> come<00:04:35.090> over

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
worry about them anymore but come over

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.810 
worry about them anymore but come over
here<00:04:35.360> though<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.720> there's<00:04:36.140> some<00:04:36.520> mighty<00:04:37.520> fine

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
here though and there's some mighty fine

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.340 
here though and there's some mighty fine
goodies<00:04:38.300> over<00:04:38.540> there<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.020> there's<00:04:39.170> also

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
goodies over there and there's also

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:56.920 
goodies over there and there's also
another<00:04:39.530> set<00:04:40.210> in<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:42.110> other<00:04:42.230> cage

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.779 

this<00:04:57.530> one's<00:04:57.710> got<00:04:57.889> some<00:04:57.949> oozy<00:04:58.400> animal<00:04:58.729> hmm<00:05:00.789> and

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
this one's got some oozy animal hmm and

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.249 
this one's got some oozy animal hmm and
I'll<00:05:01.880> go<00:05:02.000> ahead<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.270> fill<00:05:02.479> my<00:05:02.600> life<00:05:02.780> up<00:05:03.080> I'm

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
I'll go ahead and fill my life up I'm

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:10.510 
I'll go ahead and fill my life up I'm
gonna<00:05:03.350> need<00:05:03.590> it

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.029 

okay<00:05:11.569> so<00:05:12.020> finally<00:05:12.319> we<00:05:12.440> got<00:05:12.560> all<00:05:12.650> that<00:05:12.770> all<00:05:12.919> the

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
okay so finally we got all that all the

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.210 
okay so finally we got all that all the
way<00:05:13.750> now<00:05:14.750> what<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:14.900> switch<00:05:15.199> does<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.830> it<00:05:16.009> also

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
way now what that switch does is it also

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.950 
way now what that switch does is it also
not<00:05:16.759> only<00:05:16.970> doesn't<00:05:17.150> open<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.509> cage<00:05:17.720> and

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
not only doesn't open the cage and

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.360 
not only doesn't open the cage and
illuminate<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.410> room<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.740> also<00:05:18.860> opens

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
illuminate the room but it also opens

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.430 
illuminate the room but it also opens
these<00:05:19.580> gates<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.180> lifts<00:05:20.569> these<00:05:20.720> platforms

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
these gates and lifts these platforms

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.219 
these gates and lifts these platforms
that<00:05:21.590> she's<00:05:21.919> standing<00:05:22.099> on<00:05:22.340> right<00:05:22.580> now<00:05:23.229> we

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
that she's standing on right now we

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.510 
that she's standing on right now we
could<00:05:24.349> come<00:05:24.560> in<00:05:24.680> here<00:05:24.860> there's<00:05:25.069> a<00:05:25.160> switch<00:05:25.490> that

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
could come in here there's a switch that

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.550 
could come in here there's a switch that
we<00:05:25.819> can<00:05:25.849> pull<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.720> it's<00:05:27.020> gonna<00:05:27.110> open<00:05:27.289> up<00:05:27.470> a

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
we can pull and it's gonna open up a

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.290 
we can pull and it's gonna open up a
door<00:05:27.770> somewhere<00:05:28.460> else<00:05:28.639> in<00:05:28.789> the<00:05:28.849> level<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.180> we

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
door somewhere else in the level that we

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.900 
door somewhere else in the level that we
need<00:05:29.449> to<00:05:29.539> go<00:05:29.660> to<00:05:30.039> however<00:05:31.039> when<00:05:31.490> we<00:05:31.580> open<00:05:31.880> that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
need to go to however when we open that

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.640 
need to go to however when we open that
when<00:05:32.120> we<00:05:32.210> flip<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.449> switch<00:05:32.569> these<00:05:32.900> these

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
when we flip that switch these these

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.980 
when we flip that switch these these
gates<00:05:34.009> are<00:05:34.130> gonna<00:05:34.190> fall<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:34.849> we<00:05:35.690> have<00:05:35.870> to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
gates are gonna fall so we have to

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.680 
gates are gonna fall so we have to
actually<00:05:36.759> prevent<00:05:37.759> them<00:05:37.970> from<00:05:38.000> falling<00:05:38.509> so<00:05:38.630> we

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
actually prevent them from falling so we

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.790 
actually prevent them from falling so we
can<00:05:38.840> actually<00:05:38.990> get<00:05:39.229> out<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.530> that's<00:05:39.650> what

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
can actually get out and that's what

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.070 
can actually get out and that's what
this<00:05:40.460> box<00:05:40.819> right<00:05:41.270> here<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.539> for<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:41.990> a

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
this box right here is for it's a

00:05:42.080 --> 00:06:07.240 
this box right here is for it's a
movable<00:05:42.349> box<00:06:05.380> push<00:06:06.380> this<00:06:06.620> basically

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
movable box push this basically

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.240 
movable box push this basically
underneath<00:06:07.669> that<00:06:08.229> gate<00:06:09.229> there<00:06:12.099> and<00:06:13.099> that's

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
underneath that gate there and that's

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.830 
underneath that gate there and that's
gonna<00:06:13.400> prevent<00:06:13.729> all<00:06:14.000> of<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.330> gates<00:06:14.539> right

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
gonna prevent all of the gates right

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.180 
gonna prevent all of the gates right
here<00:06:15.020> from<00:06:15.169> closing<00:06:15.440> when<00:06:15.740> I<00:06:15.770> flip<00:06:16.039> this

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
here from closing when I flip this

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:23.829 
here from closing when I flip this
switch<00:06:16.389> in<00:06:17.389> here

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:23.839 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.209 

it<00:06:24.839> also<00:06:25.020> opens<00:06:25.379> up<00:06:25.469> that<00:06:25.619> door<00:06:25.679> that<00:06:26.009> I<00:06:26.099> was

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
it also opens up that door that I was

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.409 
it also opens up that door that I was
talking<00:06:26.520> about<00:06:26.699> late<00:06:26.909> earlier<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.749> below

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
talking about late earlier and below

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.600 
talking about late earlier and below
this<00:06:30.419> also<00:06:30.719> spawned<00:06:31.379> three<00:06:31.769> guys<00:06:32.159> with<00:06:32.399> guns

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
this also spawned three guys with guns

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.329 
this also spawned three guys with guns
up<00:06:32.969> in<00:06:33.089> that<00:06:33.179> area<00:06:33.529> just<00:06:34.529> outside<00:06:34.679> the<00:06:35.069> store

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.339 
up in that area just outside the store

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:40.669 
up in that area just outside the store
so<00:06:36.330> we<00:06:36.360> have<00:06:36.479> to<00:06:36.749> be<00:06:36.869> very<00:06:37.139> careful<00:06:39.499> they<00:06:40.499> don't

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:40.679 
so we have to be very careful they don't

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:47.230 
so we have to be very careful they don't
they<00:06:40.949> don't<00:06:40.979> mess<00:06:41.189> around

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:07:23.730 

if<00:06:47.660> I<00:06:47.780> can't<00:06:47.990> get<00:06:48.139> one<00:06:48.289> from<00:06:48.470> standing<00:06:48.949> here
