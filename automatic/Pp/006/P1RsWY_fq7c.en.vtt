00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
in shape by running the races and I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.810 
in shape by running the races and I
think<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:55.770> tomorrow<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.610> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
on the shoes so to speak and I have to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.810 
on the shoes so to speak and I have to
do<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.769> culture<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.280> my<00:02:50.519> class

do it because the culture of my class

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.850 
do it because the culture of my class
depends<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.410> I've<00:02:52.470> spent<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:52.800> last

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
depends on it so I've spent these last

depends on it so I've spent these last
10<00:02:53.430> days<00:02:53.510> thinking<00:02:54.510> about<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.320> planning<00:02:56.420> for

10 days thinking about and planning for

10 days thinking about and planning for
the<00:02:57.870> kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.470> classroom<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.280> will<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the kind of classroom that will have the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.610 
the kind of classroom that will have the
culture<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.810> will<00:03:00.930> hopefully<00:03:01.019> elevate

culture that will hopefully elevate

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.100 
culture that will hopefully elevate
everyone<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:04.470> realize<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:06.239> there's<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
everyone and I realize that there's a

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.759 
everyone and I realize that there's a
mental<00:03:07.620> toughness<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.500> have<00:03:10.650> to

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
mental toughness that that you have to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.850 
mental toughness that that you have to
own<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.550> has<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.269> be<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.810> tolerance<00:03:13.620> for

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
own there has to be a tolerance for

own there has to be a tolerance for

ambiguity there has to be the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.530 
ambiguity there has to be the

risks and the the willingness to have a

risks and the the willingness to have a

beginner's mind sets you know there's a

lot I can't predict about tomorrow but I

you<00:03:43.890> know<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> still<00:03:44.310> ask<00:03:44.459> myself<00:03:44.730> though<00:03:45.180> where

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
you know I still ask myself though where

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.039 
you know I still ask myself though where
does<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.810> energy<00:03:46.230> come<00:03:46.440> from<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.920> where<00:03:47.310> I

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
does this energy come from and where I

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.000 
does this energy come from and where I
hope<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.200> there<00:03:49.350> in<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.590> morning<00:03:49.859> when<00:03:49.980> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
hope it's there in the morning when I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.470 
hope it's there in the morning when I
wake<00:03:50.220> up<00:03:51.859> but<00:03:52.859> then<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.160> look<00:03:53.760> at<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.060> class

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
wake up but then I look at this class

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.690 
wake up but then I look at this class
list<00:03:54.840> beside<00:03:55.290> me<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.739> see<00:03:55.950> these<00:03:56.100> names<00:03:56.400> a

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
list beside me and I see these names a

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.210 
list beside me and I see these names a
few<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.510> students<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.049> know<00:03:58.109> already<00:03:58.709> but

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
few of the students I know already but

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.890 
few of the students I know already but
most<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.970> them<00:04:00.090> i'm<00:04:00.299> going<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.600> get<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.870> meet

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
most of them i'm going to get to meet

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.140 
most of them i'm going to get to meet
tomorrow<00:04:01.200> for<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.650> first<00:04:01.920> time<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.459> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
tomorrow for the first time and I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.330 
tomorrow for the first time and I
realized<00:04:03.570> that's<00:04:03.810> exactly<00:04:04.709> where<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:04.980> energy

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
realized that's exactly where the energy

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.810 
realized that's exactly where the energy
comes<00:04:05.489> from<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:08.100> might<00:04:08.280> be<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.549> end<00:04:08.579> of

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
comes from so this might be the end of

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.720 
comes from so this might be the end of
the<00:04:08.910> countdown<00:04:09.299> but<00:04:10.170> now<00:04:10.980> it's<00:04:11.340> time<00:04:11.579> to

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
the countdown but now it's time to

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.710 
the countdown but now it's time to
implement<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.380> will<00:04:13.769> continue<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.760> vlog

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
implement so I will continue to vlog

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.699 
implement so I will continue to vlog
about<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:17.340> first<00:04:17.609> 10<00:04:18.030> days<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.780> trying<00:04:19.410> to

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
about the first 10 days of trying to

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.090 
about the first 10 days of trying to
implement<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.609> class<00:04:20.880> culture

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
implement this class culture

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.090 
implement this class culture
and<00:04:22.300> really<00:04:23.440> exercising<00:04:24.440> all<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.980> those
