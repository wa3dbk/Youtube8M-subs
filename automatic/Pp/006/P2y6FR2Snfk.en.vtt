00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello youtube friends today we are in the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.030
 review of a texture or rather a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.370
 texture and at the same time it is a shader that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.049
 true the shaders are identical to the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.080
 of the pc and they are in real time 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.390
 personally they are very nice but 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.689
 well let's start first of all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.100
 I will teach how to install these shaders 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 we have to download the file that they 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 I will leave in the description and then 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 they go to block launcher the key 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.309
 block launcher options for the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.350
 select textures package are going away 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.460
 where they were downloaded is this 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.969
 geither cip they go back they come back to 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.659
 block launcher and now we are going to this 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.210
 world only a little bit of lag remains 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.019
 not much but yes and see let had the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.019
 shine already 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.130
 see even though I'm with all the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.240
 maximum not long 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.850
 maybe it gives very little 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.620
 see everything looks very father looks a lot 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.570
 clearer the lighting here as 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.900
 you can see you see you see shadow in this 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 part in this part as we go 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070
 removing as you see more shadow as the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.040
 sun is on that side because you see the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.680
 shade so let's now see the water that is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.470
 something that is also very beautiful see 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.400
 what beautiful water the water is very 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 crystalline 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.890
 if we go down I think the fancy graphics 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.479
 I recommend you not download the fans and graph 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.170
 graphics good the nice graphics already 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.720
 if the water removed and will not be 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.229
 that with the fancy graphics activated it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.180
 see very very crystal clear with the fancy 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.310
 graphics disabled is seen even more 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.770
 crystalline as you can see so almost not 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.659
 it shows but in reality here there is water and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.899
 see the bubbles come out now let's 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.899
 to return 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 and because the truth is very nice since 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.780
 this is shader texture makes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.580
 our minecraft look more beautiful and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
 Well, nothing you know, I'll leave the link 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.380
 in the description and good friends that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.600

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.350
