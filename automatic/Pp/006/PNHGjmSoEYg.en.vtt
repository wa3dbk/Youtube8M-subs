00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.730 
which is down the back a sleeve
measurement<00:02:04.549> which<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:06.500> can

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
measurement which is here so you can

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.130 
measurement which is here so you can
take<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.369> measuring<00:02:08.149> tape<00:02:08.360> which<00:02:08.600> we<00:02:08.750> have<00:02:08.929> will

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
take a measuring tape which we have will

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.680 
take a measuring tape which we have will
demonstrate<00:02:09.410> should<00:02:10.160> be<00:02:10.280> now<00:02:10.610> yeah<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.480> can<00:02:11.600> do

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
demonstrate should be now yeah we can do

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.270 
demonstrate should be now yeah we can do
that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.110 
that
so<00:02:12.790> we<00:02:12.880> have<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> measuring<00:02:13.390> tape<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:14.020> shows

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
so we have a measuring tape that shows

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.350 
so we have a measuring tape that shows
how<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> would<00:02:16.360> measure<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:17.790> sharked<00:02:18.790> an<00:02:19.120> inch

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
how you would measure I sharked an inch

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.040 
how you would measure I sharked an inch
below<00:02:19.600> my<00:02:20.170> massive<00:02:20.620> our<00:02:20.770> whole<00:02:21.040> hand<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
below my massive our whole hand to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.280 
below my massive our whole hand to
measure<00:02:23.290> my<00:02:23.860> chest<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:26.080> one<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:27.520> exactly<00:02:28.290> 31

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
measure my chest this one is exactly 31

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.770 
measure my chest this one is exactly 31
inches<00:02:29.980> 31<00:02:30.640> interests<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.239> that's<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.569> half

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
inches 31 interests and that's on half

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.510 
inches 31 interests and that's on half
so<00:02:32.680> you're<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> want<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.220> double<00:02:33.489> that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
so you're going to want to double that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.290 
so you're going to want to double that
so<00:02:33.910> that's<00:02:34.000> 62<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.470> 5xl<00:02:36.370> she<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.209> go

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
so that's 62 for this 5xl she can go

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.360 
so that's 62 for this 5xl she can go
look<00:02:37.420> at<00:02:37.510> size<00:02:37.690> drive<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.350> pc<00:02:38.739> 61<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> bet
