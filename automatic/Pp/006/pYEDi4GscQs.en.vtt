00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.630
 and it's trivia about goten and trunks 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.760
 number 1 in the timeline of 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.110
 trunks of the future not notice does not exist 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.030
 because goku dies of a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.340
 heart disease before arrival 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.190
 of the androids since it was conceived 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.739
 shortly before the cell number games 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.720
 2 so far has never been reached 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.350
 truly know who it came to be 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.000
 stronger between the liter nqs number 312 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.010
 nor trunks could have been the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.290
 most powerful warriors in the universe 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.420
 of dragon ball z since both exceeded 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.730
 to his parents in many ways during 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.399
 his childhood but for a strange reason 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.490
 both stopped training seriously and 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.440
 they became average warriors 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.360
 number 4 noten at first was 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.399
 created by toriyama to replace 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.440
 goku so that and goian will take the 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.060
 role of main protagonist in the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.220
 series however the fans 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.310
 they rejected the idea that boko was 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 replaced number 5 at the end of 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.660
 lake ball z noten takes a haircut 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.759
 new that looks more like his brother 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.890
 goian since he has the same long hair 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.080
 messy that goian when he was young 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.150
 Akira did this so do not confuse 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.980
 with his father goku but as we have seen 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.440
 that several dragon things 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.780
 z were changed into dragon ball super 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.910
 maybe we can see it with the same cut 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.090
 that goku or even a more different one 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.100
 number 6 your friendship with trunks is the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.730
 reincarnation of goku friendship and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.650
 jim when they were kids number 7 trunks is 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.120
 the only sayayin of the series that does not 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.220
 has black hair or 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.410
 chestnut this is because the character 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.540
 akira's least favorite is vegeta and 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.730
 I wanted to hurt his pride knowing that the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.880
 bulma genes were superior to those 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.220
 of the number 8 in the special the two 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.530
 warriors of the future trong becomes 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.970
 in super sayayin to see goiÃ¡n dead 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.550
 but in the manga he could already 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.400
 transform into super sayayin before 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.530
 that the androids will kill goian number 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.360
 9 Tron's favorite food is 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.730
 grilled meat and he likes it very much 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.240
 attend the car racing number 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.520
 10 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.560
 unlike the trunk of the future this 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.480
 trunk is somewhat cowardly and spoiled by 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.780
 his upbringing in the peace period of the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.340
 land and living in a rich family 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.200
 good friends those were all 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.150

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.760
