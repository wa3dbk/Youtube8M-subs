 hello it will crackle of joy and rock 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.219
 giguère 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 welcome to this passion capsule 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 gardens so today we talk about 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.039
 what veronique today we have the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.189
 happiness to talk about news 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.539
 annuals for the 2004 season we are at 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 domain joly-de lotbinière 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.369
 where he is it's a lot of news 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.840
 new in the annual is going 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.090
 to be a pure pleasure for us from you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.579
 present them 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.850
 so I proud to show you saw a plan 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 which has always intrigued me since 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 the last two years since his 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.090
 exits 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 so these digital flames elimination 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.670
 so we see here it looks like our jt 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.270
 the traditional but much more 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 beautiful so we see here again the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.579
 plan growth seems like this alone 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.710
 little problem it's not a plant 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.270
 perennial that is a cross between 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.159
 digital elite plexus 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.689
 that's why we can not cultivate it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.000
 here only in zone 7 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.310
 but by cons I advise you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 because look at the first of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.810
 new flowers and it's really going 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.619
 intrigued your neighbor know without 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 doubt the angelo is a plant made of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.080
 cluster like this is rather directed 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 so today we present to you 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.820
 langella this trail in blue the name genia 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 who is going to be more trg then falling in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.689
 your stews like that we can add 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.110
 something that will give more 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.790
 well height will set her up bandaged 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.470
 to have a ground cover this plant 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.200
 love drought 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.649
 so if you go on vacation it's a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 Good choice 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.149
 here is a new verbena series 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 vivid here we do not red and pech 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.149
 since we find it interesting 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.000
 that she is still very much in bloom at this 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.009
 moment of the year in us because 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.439
 sometimes we observe that verbena 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.049
 can run out in mid-summer 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.009
 however empty life we see that she 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.840
 is very much alive 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.620
 here we have a beautiful tropical plant 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.409
 so novelty it's a salmon cat 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.129
 so very close to roommates and 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.140
 allocations 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.879
 so here we see the call sheet 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.819
 insults then it's pretty irregular 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.620
 and even some who say that the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.440
 leaf foliage is sick but not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.629
 it's a characteristic of the leaf 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.730
 and seen small spur site 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.040
 finish the sheet then a beautiful 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.280
 tropical plant to put in your 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.220
 amenities and give a little height 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.940
 here is a very nice roommate novelties 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.799
 2015 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:51.959
 the white lava we see that the band 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.480
 white happens after he becomes 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.700
 more mature so we had a few 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.739
 years the m6 reveals so far strips 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.959
 white were much later 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.209
 but now that's where we have a very 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.040
 beautiful contrast and in addition if you 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.810
 look here it does not reach july the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.590
 girl who gives all its charm to these 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.140
 big colocation yet another canoe 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.349
 who will make his 2015 entry will have 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.389
 also two channels b mauri it's a 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.799
 transfer of pretoria near workers 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.130
 who had a rather varied foliage 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.500
 with streaks as we see here that 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.819
 looks like tropicana and looks 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.769
 a little pink sanders 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.200
 but it's a canoe that goes a lot more 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.150
 enlarged and that will give a flame 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.310
 orange mail we see it there is a 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.680
 little compact then it's just a 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.569
 year it will make a beautiful a beautiful form 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.269
 compact in your bank 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.090
 so a really interesting canoe for 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.799
 2015 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.299
 so yes if we have a beautiful channel 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.299
 while he is part of the series 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.190
 that an anovo brand new series that 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.379
 should replace the tropical series to 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.639
 because of its greatness we see it's a 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.949
 canoe which is still quite high 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.629
 there is a little 10 hours here is red 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.430
 art the name of the leaf first god 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.199
 which makes a nice contrast with the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.220
 green leaf and there is roof color 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.519
 then a yellow 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.169
 here the rose is a village where the red and 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.299
 more floriferous but we show you the 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.849
 pink here because the plan is very beautiful 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.569
 then a plant to be born at home for 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.729
 2015 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.840
 so today we show you some 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.180
 novelties in annual plants 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.159
 who can complete trees the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.440
 perennial shrubs 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.120
 have fun it was veronique the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.870
 joy and to the Bulgarians who 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.870
 good gardening
