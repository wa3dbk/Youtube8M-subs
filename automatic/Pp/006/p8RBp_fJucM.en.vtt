the delay

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.219 
the delay
what's<00:01:29.810> edge<00:01:29.960> doing<00:01:30.320> here<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:32.110> could<00:01:33.110> be

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
what's edge doing here I could be

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.040 
what's edge doing here I could be
missing<00:01:33.350> something<00:01:33.920> but<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.820> slowed<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:35.810> song

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
missing something but I slowed this song

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.780 
missing something but I slowed this song
down<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.320> couple<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.890> songs<00:01:37.130> down<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.670> he

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
down a couple of the songs down and he

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.070 
down a couple of the songs down and he
changes<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.270> up<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.450> little<00:01:38.659> bit<00:01:38.810> here<00:01:39.020> and

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
changes it up a little bit here and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.930 
changes it up a little bit here and
there<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:39.290> in<00:01:39.590> general<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.160> think<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.820> is

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
there but in general I think this is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.960 
there but in general I think this is
pretty<00:01:41.150> active<00:01:41.800> alright<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.340> first<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.910> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
pretty active alright the first is a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.180 
pretty active alright the first is a
deep<00:01:44.270> D<00:01:44.690> chord<00:01:44.990> formation<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:45.650> keep<00:01:46.040> the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
deep D chord formation but keep the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.350 
deep D chord formation but keep the
third<00:01:46.460> finger<00:01:47.210> off<00:01:47.479> alright<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.030> again<00:01:50.030> we'll

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
third finger off alright so again we'll

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.840 
third finger off alright so again we'll
zoom<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:50.960> we'll<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.159> detailed<00:01:52.610> way

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
zoom in and we'll do it the detailed way

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.550 
zoom in and we'll do it the detailed way
so<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.270> can<00:01:53.450> see<00:01:53.690> everything<00:01:53.960> really

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
so you can see everything really

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.790 
so you can see everything really
carefully<00:01:55.390> okay<00:01:56.390> hopefully<00:01:56.869> that's<00:01:57.259> close

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
carefully okay hopefully that's close

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.120 
carefully okay hopefully that's close

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
little bit sometimes he does the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.370 
little bit sometimes he does the
following<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.480> start<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.959> D<00:02:15.110> string

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
following you start with the D string

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.680 
following you start with the D string
okay

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.180 

you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.190 

sometimes<00:02:23.910> he<00:02:24.000> does<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.920> GB<00:02:25.920> pause

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
sometimes he does that just GB pause

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.720 
sometimes he does that just GB pause
pause<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.190> e<00:02:29.660> be

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.300 

sometimes<00:02:35.730> he<00:02:35.969> plays<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.540> B<00:02:36.689> on<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> way<00:02:37.019> down

sometimes he plays the B on the way down

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.380 
sometimes he plays the B on the way down
meaning<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.879> what<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> probably

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
so that's DG string then the e again and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.740 
so that's DG string then the e again and
then<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> bees<00:04:36.420> G<00:04:37.880> okay
