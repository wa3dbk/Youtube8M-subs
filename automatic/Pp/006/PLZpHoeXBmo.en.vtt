me those are parthia and Egypt so I was
definitely<00:00:21.510> expecting<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.800> both

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
definitely expecting it to be both

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160 
definitely expecting it to be both
parthia<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.789> Egypt<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.359> not<00:00:24.630> both<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.080> at

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
least one of them so first of all if I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.979 
least one of them so first of all if I
want<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> talk<00:00:31.349> about<00:00:31.380> parthia<00:00:32.510> the<00:00:33.510> map<00:00:33.719> is

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
want to talk about parthia the map is

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
want to talk about parthia the map is
supposed<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> go<00:00:34.770> much<00:00:35.010> further<00:00:35.340> east<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
supposed to go much further east this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.100 
supposed to go much further east this
time<00:00:36.770> then<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.309> Rome<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.540> allows

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
time then in Rome one so that allows

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.970 
time then in Rome one so that allows
parthia<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.550> room<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.030> expand<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
parthia much more room to expand and

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
parthia much more room to expand and
parthia<00:00:43.980> definitely<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.760> potential<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
parthia definitely has potential to be a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.060 
parthia definitely has potential to be a
very<00:00:46.160> very<00:00:47.160> powerful<00:00:47.550> faction<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
very very powerful faction a

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
very very powerful faction a
particularly<00:00:50.070> late<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> game<00:00:51.829> once<00:00:52.829> they

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
particularly late in the game once they

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
particularly late in the game once they
know<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.730> conquer<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.660> lot<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> east

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
know they can conquer a lot of the east

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.779 
know they can conquer a lot of the east
I<00:00:55.559> don't<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.800> what's<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I don't know what's going to be to the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.420 
I don't know what's going to be to the
east<00:00:57.000> maybe<00:00:57.930> rebel<00:00:58.350> factions<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:59.039> don't<00:00:59.250> know

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
east maybe rebel factions i don't know

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
east maybe rebel factions i don't know
i'm<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.699> quite<00:00:59.969> sure<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.449> maybe<00:01:00.480> they'll

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
i'm not quite sure or maybe they'll

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
i'm not quite sure or maybe they'll
start<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.070> forward<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> east

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
start all the way forward to the east

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
start all the way forward to the east
because<00:01:03.210> historically<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.170> actually

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
because historically that's actually

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.580 
because historically that's actually
what<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.799> did<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.390> don't<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.540> exactly<00:01:07.290> where

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
what they did I don't know exactly where

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
what they did I don't know exactly where
Parthia<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.460> start<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Parthia will start but that is going to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.600 
Parthia will start but that is going to
be<00:01:12.360> found<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:12.930> once<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> game<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.560> released<00:01:13.830> so

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
be found at once the game is released so

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.210 
be found at once the game is released so
definitely<00:01:17.960> Parthia<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.470> become<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> powerful

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
definitely Parthia can become a powerful

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
definitely Parthia can become a powerful
faction<00:01:20.869> since<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.049> doubt<00:01:22.320> any<00:01:22.590> other<00:01:22.710> facts

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
faction since I doubt any other facts

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
faction since I doubt any other facts
any<00:01:23.580> other<00:01:23.880> major<00:01:24.150> faction<00:01:24.720> would<00:01:25.280> challenge

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
any other major faction would challenge

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
any other major faction would challenge
them<00:01:26.780> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.409> Far<00:01:28.680> East<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.210> Egypt<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:31.590> are

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
them in the Far East so Egypt they are

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.130 
them in the Far East so Egypt they are
the<00:01:31.890> other<00:01:32.070> faction<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.689> been<00:01:33.900> revealed

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the other faction that has been revealed

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.440 
the other faction that has been revealed
since<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.740> first<00:01:34.920> video<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:38.060> hopefully<00:01:39.060> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
since my first video and hopefully this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.649 
since my first video and hopefully this
time<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:40.310> Creative<00:01:41.310> Assembly<00:01:41.400> will<00:01:41.939> make<00:01:42.210> Egypt

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
time a Creative Assembly will make Egypt

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.060 
time a Creative Assembly will make Egypt
a<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:44.509> historical<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> time<00:01:46.070> they

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
a bit more historical of the time they

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.630 
a bit more historical of the time they
were<00:01:47.100> definitely<00:01:47.520> more<00:01:48.170> representative<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
were definitely more representative of

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.660 
were definitely more representative of
the<00:01:52.189> old<00:01:53.189> Egypt<00:01:53.790> before<00:01:54.140> Alexander<00:01:55.369> took<00:01:56.369> over

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the old Egypt before Alexander took over

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.740 
the old Egypt before Alexander took over
and<00:01:56.909> all<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:58.549> his<00:01:59.549> they<00:02:00.119> should<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.509> more

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and all that his they should be more

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.850 
and all that his they should be more
Greek<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:02.270> their<00:02:03.270> nature<00:02:04.070> for<00:02:05.070> both<00:02:05.250> gods<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
Greek in their nature for both gods and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.620 
Greek in their nature for both gods and
army<00:02:07.860> set<00:02:08.310> up

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.660 

we'll<00:02:11.410> see<00:02:11.680> what<00:02:11.980> they<00:02:12.100> have<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> do<00:02:12.430> there

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
we'll see what they have to do there

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.790 
we'll see what they have to do there
though<00:02:13.830> now<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.570> certain<00:02:17.320> factions

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
though now there are certain factions

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.690
