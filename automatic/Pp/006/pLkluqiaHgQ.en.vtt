it this thing called fume out goes to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.510 
it this thing called fume out goes to
the<00:02:39.440> outside<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:42.380> uses<00:02:43.160> basically<00:02:43.340> no<00:02:43.940> power

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
the outside it uses basically no power

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.070 
the outside it uses basically no power
but<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:47.180> super<00:02:47.360> fancy<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
but that that's super fancy and the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.740 
but that that's super fancy and the
Misses<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.910> probably<00:02:50.240> airtight<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:53.390> just

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
Misses it's probably airtight so it just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.400 
Misses it's probably airtight so it just
the<00:02:54.440> batteries<00:02:54.800> are<00:02:54.950> contained<00:02:55.460> in<00:02:55.700> there<00:02:56.410> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the batteries are contained in there and
