Special Forces for their selected
program<00:00:19.530> you'll<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.700> lot<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.970> emphasis<00:00:21.539> in

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
program you'll see a lot of emphasis in

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.690 
program you'll see a lot of emphasis in
different<00:00:21.990> areas<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.220> celite

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
different areas for one in a celite

different areas for one in a celite
unilateral<00:00:24.570> or<00:00:24.600> one-legged<00:00:25.050> exercises<00:00:25.740> this

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
unilateral or one-legged exercises this

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.530 
unilateral or one-legged exercises this
is<00:00:26.580> due<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:27.000> fact<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.510> both

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
is due to the fact that we're both

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.930 
is due to the fact that we're both
trying<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> help<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.830> hip<00:00:29.070> mobility<00:00:29.280> and

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
trying to help the hip mobility and

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.569 
trying to help the hip mobility and
lower<00:00:30.570> leg<00:00:30.870> stability<00:00:31.500> hip<00:00:32.040> mobility<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
lower leg stability hip mobility is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
lower leg stability hip mobility is
important<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.690> sure<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.989> these<00:00:34.079> guys

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
important to make sure that these guys

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
important to make sure that these guys
are<00:00:34.350> running<00:00:34.680> effectively<00:00:35.239> marching<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
are running effectively marching and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.200 
are running effectively marching and
have<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> decreased<00:00:37.350> risk<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.980> low<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.670> injury

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
have a decreased risk in low back injury

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360 
have a decreased risk in low back injury
you<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> lower<00:00:40.260> leg<00:00:40.530> dysfunction<00:00:40.920> is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you know the lower leg dysfunction is

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.189 
you know the lower leg dysfunction is
actually<00:00:41.699> pretty<00:00:42.030> prevalent<00:00:42.300> than<00:00:42.780> most

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
actually pretty prevalent than most

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.979 
actually pretty prevalent than most
people<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.800> gets<00:00:44.359> exasperated<00:00:45.359> by<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.659> fact

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
people but gets exasperated by the fact

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
people but gets exasperated by the fact
that<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.409> guys<00:00:46.679> are<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:47.070> through<00:00:47.219> trails

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that these guys are going through trails

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
that these guys are going through trails
and<00:00:47.909> other<00:00:48.289> train<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.499> often<00:00:49.890> quite

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and other train that's often quite

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.309 
and other train that's often quite
difficult<00:00:50.339> to<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:50.999> through<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
difficult to get through so this

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.869 
difficult to get through so this
emphasis<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> quite<00:00:53.100> important<00:00:53.640> you'll<00:00:53.760> also

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
emphasis is quite important you'll also

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.610 
emphasis is quite important you'll also
see<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.269> fact<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.659> we're<00:00:54.960> making<00:00:55.230> them<00:00:55.499> go

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
see the fact that we're making them go

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
see the fact that we're making them go
through<00:00:55.649> different<00:00:56.039> movement<00:00:56.519> patterns<00:00:56.909> by

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
through different movement patterns by

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
through different movement patterns by
going<00:00:57.719> through<00:00:57.809> different<00:00:58.230> patterns<00:00:58.739> their

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
going through different patterns their

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
going through different patterns their
ability<00:00:59.729> to<00:00:59.760> perform<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.449> agile<00:01:01.050> goes<00:01:01.350> way

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
ability to perform and be agile goes way

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889 
ability to perform and be agile goes way
up<00:01:02.120> common<00:01:03.120> mistake<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.629> lot<00:01:03.659> of<00:01:03.809> people

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
up common mistake that a lot of people

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
up common mistake that a lot of people
making<00:01:04.260> their<00:01:04.350> fitness<00:01:04.559> programs<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.280> get

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
making their fitness programs they get

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.360 
making their fitness programs they get
stuck<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.380> certain<00:01:07.380> movement<00:01:07.800> patterns<00:01:08.190> that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
stuck in certain movement patterns that

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.620 
stuck in certain movement patterns that
are<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.550> familiar<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.180> example<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
are very familiar for example in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
are very familiar for example in
cowbells<00:01:10.050> they'll<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> swing<00:01:11.130> they'll<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
cowbells they'll do a swing they'll do a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
cowbells they'll do a swing they'll do a
clean<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.630> snatch<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> relatively

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
clean the little snatch and relatively

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
clean the little snatch and relatively
speaking<00:01:14.219> these<00:01:14.460> movement<00:01:14.909> cards<00:01:15.149> are<00:01:15.240> very

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
speaking these movement cards are very

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
speaking these movement cards are very
similar<00:01:15.719> you're<00:01:16.619> also<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.219> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
similar you're also going to see that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
similar you're also going to see that
we've<00:01:17.700> used<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> ultimate<00:01:18.479> sandbag<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
we've used the ultimate sandbag and the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.219 
we've used the ultimate sandbag and the
TRX<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.369> lot<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> people<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.750> understand

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
TRX a lot of people don't understand

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.630 
TRX a lot of people don't understand
they<00:01:22.290> forget<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.829> they<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> only<00:01:23.490> way

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

to<00:01:23.700> make<00:01:23.909> progress<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.539> increasing<00:01:25.049> weight

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
to make progress is increasing weight

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.279 
to make progress is increasing weight
remember<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.850> progressive<00:01:27.509> resistance<00:01:27.659> not

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289
