00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.500
 good today I bring you a tutorial what 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.080
 pretty basic but good that one of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.129
 the guys have asked me for layers that 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.310
 some do not know and there could be 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.710
 comment on the benefit of this 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.550
 how to put sounds as they expand in the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.210
 sps but without a memory card 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.230
 the audio input that the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.230
 the battery back 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 well I have it connected to the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.770
 computer better said to the computer 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 at the entrance 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:39.410
 audio through a cable that is 35 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.410
 r has been commented with an adapter plus 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 and one of the most important things well 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.570
 be done 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
 that behind the battery has two 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.750
 selectors rather one with two 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.750
 positions 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.710
 one says it's a matter of impedance 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.230
 this as there is one with a computer 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.729
 connected you to keep leaving 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.440
 the right that says line because 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.590
 obviously it's a computer and not a 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.659
 microphone 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.120
 well I usually is the study 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 why 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.850
 it is only 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.310
 unlike the asx you can put a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.030
 sound per pad you can not mix 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.100
 or anything like that so if I have 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.680
 that I gain mixed sounds I mix it in 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.840
 the study and the steps as one here and in 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 the thing is easy enough only that 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.370
 have a couple of precautions and then 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.990
 he grabs her by the hand and he's ready 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:41.540
 this since I have a kit and I'm going to 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.790
 change the drum for one that I have here 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.690
 what is this since it is playing 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.690
 Take heed 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 the very easy procedure we go to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.820
 button 16 sampling here we press it to go to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 say select peace of destiny tocas 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.830
 the pad where you want to record the sound 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.930
 and will start reading standby 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.759
 here is nice that we have is 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.790
 a meter would be input 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.950
 to see this 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.109
 the amount of volume with which you are 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.879
 entering the sound source but in 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.480
 that this cable sends like the eyelet I have 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.480
 all broken now 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.090
 and this limits highlights this which is more 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.790
 visit is the technical limit when it is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.580
 surpassing and now going down volume things 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.010
 that nothing comes out saturated but what 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.720
 I will go up the volume a little bit 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.490
 thing that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.830
 I arrived 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.830
 as much as possible but without saturating what 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.130
 a little 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.069
 I'm going to more 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.860
 there is to pass 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.160
 and then the rest is very easy you 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.660
 says standby this has good that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.060
 out there with the wide ones with a fountain 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.740
 audio and not with the card is that the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.090
 damages are automatically trimmed which is 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.910
 this just start stop and say wait 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.760
 while there is nothing the asps wait 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.110
 to enter a sound source and there 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.250
 start recording it's like you 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.390
 trims automatically then 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.390
 we give play 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.840
 and ready we give you start stop you can 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.280
 change the name if you think I always what 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.250
 we cook total after he heard that it is 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.610
 each thing just interprets twinkling of 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.620
 action to breaking writing and ready and 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.620
 he and the bombo already have it here 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.989
 is the descent after this good me here 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.530
 because I have a sequence and then I 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.530
 I add a crack 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.110
 we repeat we click on assembly 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.019
 we select what we want 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.480
 start reading in standby start stop 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.110
 wait 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.030
 we reproduce creates a scratch we squeeze 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.470
 start stop 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.739
 we press center so that it is saved 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.739
 guard 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.940
 and ready the chicken 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.210
 Well I hope you have served this 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.560
 any of things consult me ​​by the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.389
 face session in the comments video 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.290
 and good to keep doing a bit of 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.290
 lucky boys noise
