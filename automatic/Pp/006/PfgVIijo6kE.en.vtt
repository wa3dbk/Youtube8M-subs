00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.540
 Roasted pork ribs 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 Ingredients: 1kg pork belly, 2 lemongrass, 50g ginger, 3 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.820
 fish sauce soup, 2 tablespoons Maggi sauce, 1 tablespoon thick soy sauce, 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.760
 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.620
 To make my pork ribs roast, 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.160
 I prepare the marinade a day in advance. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.540
 I take off the little hard end and the green part 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.650
 at the ends of the lemongrass stems. 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
 Then I thin them finely. 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.440
 I peel the ginger, 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 and I cut it into pieces. 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.880
 I crush the garlic cloves and then peel them. 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.100
 Now I'm going to pound the lemongrass, 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.710
 ginger and garlic in a mortar. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.680
 I start by crushing lemongrass. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.400
 When they are well pounded, I add the pieces of ginger, I continue to pound. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.780
 And I add the garlic cloves. 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.220
 I pour these three ingredients pounded on the pork. 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.239
 I add a tablespoon of sugar. 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.520
 A quarter of a teaspoon of salt, 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.980
 two tablespoons of fish sauce, 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.300
 two tablespoons of Maggi sauce, 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.020
 two tablespoons oyster sauce, 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.670
 a tablespoon of thick soy sauce, and a little ground pepper. 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.939
 I spread the marinade on all pork bones. 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.880
 Then I let them marinate for one night in the refrigerator. 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000
 After one night, I put the pork ribs in a dish. 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.180
 I preheat the oven to 200 Â°, thermostat 7. 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.040
 I put the pork bones to cook for 50 minutes. 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.000
 I return them halfway through cooking. 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420
 The pork bones are golden brown. 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.280
 I cut them into pieces. 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.680
 Serve with sticky rice or Thai flavored rice. 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.000
 Enjoy your meal.
