 hello and welcome to the live 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.650
 video of me I am to the app store 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.890
 and I froze for the first time today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.960
 my ipod touch fifth generation 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.920
 circuit is quite simply times and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.509
 Now you can see how the Sun 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.770
 looks like if we get an ipod touch that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.470
 first time starts and yes I want you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.910
 then it will be quite setup and it will be 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 Of course, more videos to the iPod 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.689
 Definitely this channel and the ipad 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.369
 mini if I order now so 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.250
 you can definitely get up, too 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.200
 videos for the ipad mini look forward 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.300
 then this is the first one here 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 Welcome Screen 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 there we have to unlock once you have to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.969

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.410
 Enter password 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.969

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.340
 I'm doing car services now 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.960

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.600
 Restore Backup 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 Now I have to come with me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.199
 sign up for my apple id 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.299
 if you do not have apple id around this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.520
 first time you have an apple product 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.869
 you create one 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.939
 I had an ipod touch system before 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.189
 do a backup of my old one now 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.750
 so after you with your apple id 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 accept 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 Now we have to select the backup 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.680
 but restore it and yes now 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.689
 it completely out of backup again 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.369
 made it takes a bit 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.110
 so after now has loaded briefly 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 Restore step from the backup 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 now it will unlock completely then 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.140
