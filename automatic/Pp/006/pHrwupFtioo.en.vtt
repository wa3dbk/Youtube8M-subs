00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 the cooling system serves to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.350
 control the engine temperature 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.030
 Do you know how it works when 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.759
 how it should be cleaned 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.410
 The Bahia showed up again today. 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 the vote will tell you about one more 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 superimportant subject today you go 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.350
 know a little more about the importance of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.750
 cleaning system 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 engine and singe will explain to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.920
 People sing it, how does that work? 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.449
 cleaning is important to be is the car 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.590
 When he comes from the factory he came 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.970
 engine coolant 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 popularly 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.399
 then there is a need for your 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.530
 every six months. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.020
 if the type was used under conditions 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.629
 severe and every year and normal conditions 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 why the importance of this is the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.129
 single investment and cool the engine 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 cause I bring the engine work and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.079
 lower temperature is to increase 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 life of the hose water pump 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.730
 power supply and one thing 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.579
 very important is how to use and how 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.079
 replace the recognition book always 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.210
 which is to use ipê farm 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 recognition seek to work with 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.650
 demineralized water because this water 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.630
 I did not count the chlorine and the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 chlorine is one of the main 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.280
 Bad faith when you put in the post 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.530
 the person puts the recognition book is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 so complete with ordinary water due to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.590
 our region but also in Salvador the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 Water salinity level very 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.009
 large then it says further 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.350
 in this area is very large and this can 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.420
 form the one with a round with time 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 begins on iron already decreases the useful life 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.000
 water pump reduces the service life of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.740
 hoses 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350
 the proof returns to show that the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.810
 lock the car starts to heat up right 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.250
 heating can generate one last 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.259
 heating the burner gasket 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.119
 the funding to your 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.880
 search for people to understand a little 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.710
 more about the term of exchange as it is that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.110
 time to make this exchange 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.360
 this cleaning in the cooling system 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.250
 and if it is necessary as I said so 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 with this it reveals every six months and that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 are normal every year and have always sought 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.420
 the oil specified by the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.700
 manufacturer be a pink organic additive 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.009
 sky and mineral additive that is blue whiting 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.990
 or if the pace becomes technical then it 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.750
 you have to find out why 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.340
 is correct and the ratio of mixing or 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.830
 are normally vehicles 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.960
 they work the two liters of additive 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.150
 four of water on average a system of 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.590
 closing of the edition of water and medium 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.480
 small car larger 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.790
 he will get a good amount a little 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.950
 highest additive in average pickup truck 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.620
 Additive then always in the same Trevita 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.510
 the proportion he can not work is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.240
 wrong way that works in the proportion 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.490
 40 selective and 60% water now to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.100
 people know which liquid should be 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.690
 always in the system manual. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.160
 vehicle is that the mother manual in the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.490
 vehicle and is showing and in the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.000
 reservoir it shows the e rosé g12 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.100
 huh 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.110
 ie the additive sitek I'm always one 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.180
 year to owner's profit comes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.400
 showing and in the problem of bad will see 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.140
 specifying which victim is correct and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.110
 use the important thing is you work 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.600
 specified by the manufacturer. 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.220
 each automaker has a specific book 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.140
 of that manufacturer then look for 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.250
 use a book specified by the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.840
 manufacturer 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.320
 let's say the car is already showing 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 water in the rust arrangement in the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.490
 agreement to submit the agreement 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.230
 rust what the driver should do 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.660
 it can put the liquid 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.610
 cooling or should be replaced and 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.560
 care they really should have in this 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.630
 occasion the first procedure is it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.300
 to make a review is to check whether mothers 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.640
 they are dry because what I can 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.860
 put an additive and an additive it has 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.470
 cleaning action then cleaning the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.959
 that will happen will have locations 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.470
 hoses only own radiator 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.300
 places to vote with jax aa part 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.190
 because the wear and tear that is going on 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.110
 I'm going to launch a product that 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.450
 product has the function of cleaning when 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.459
 he is clean year he will take some 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.590
 fatigue issue internally radiator 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.600
 and can drill the radiator 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.720
 There you will not get better than mine. 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.090
 The system was dirty and did not leak 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.130
 from the moment I cleaned the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.959
 started to download then people did not 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.930
 You'll want to understand why, why? 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.060
 leaked then if it's very dirty I do not 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.489
 I recommend this so it recommends to do 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.400
 cleaning with additives containing 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.739
 abrasive so as not to damage another point 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.040
 in question calls music is really the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.810
 fact the water often download 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.960
 spontaneously say so from the radio 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.070
 of the vehicle, which must be the act 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.170
 driver must have 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.120
 if the water is going down now can not 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.250
 there is some leakage and 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.710
 qualify yourself in the morning in a bathtub 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.960
 the radiator itself can 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.300
 having stuck so it is not something can not 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.950
 download interface can not download can 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.870
 download what he 34 even download 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.910
 bullshit but is coming down from arriving at 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.950
 minimum can not be leaked 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.690
 there is a deadline for 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.300
 cool the driver do this 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.220
 revision requires pre preventive exams 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.530
 It has to be done every 10,000 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.720
 kilometers and and when speaking about exam 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.360
 is to detect on the system is dirty if it is 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.550
 Needs to be cleaned right or wrong 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.560
 if there is leakage and even the system itself 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.330
 defensive eighth largest collective 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.520
 own goal it shows where it is 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.040
 leaking so it leaves the mark of 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.050
 octaves then makes it even easier for the 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.480
 professional is always stay even 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.790
 smart in the preventive reviews she 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.600
 olivia that is normal case and works 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.460
 the low temperature and low for what is 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.920
 So you have even your own 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.960
 car fuel will improve 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.060
 so you have no surprises in the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.550
 future has lost the engine which is one more 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.430
 there, you have to rectify the motor 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.650
 make your life worse make me trade your 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.650
 as in your manual
