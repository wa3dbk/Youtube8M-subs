00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.260
 and there is a warm welcome to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.209
 this little speculation video 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.059
 We had a taste 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.949
 period seen that this troupe 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 It should have been here 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.310
 really only really in the na 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 yes how should you say it was actually 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
 just a little bit more or 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.130
 less is it in a little update 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.420
 came out of the sneaker and there you have 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.880
 swimming and flying in the background 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.570
 but since then they are never again 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.579
 surfaced 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.620
 and what many people have said 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 that the transporter is with you 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.150
 can transport the units then 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.410
 be suspended somewhere right 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.030
 understood how that should work 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.530
 I have to this day still do not but 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.579
 I think it's exciting, I mean 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.200
 if you look at it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 the looks a bit as if the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.620
 a truncated archer sound 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.170
 and at the sides are just completely 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 classic three level no idea four 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 or five cannons you the golden one 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 rings has simply taped ran 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:06.329
 and below somehow red-red 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.079
 corp like the balloon alone junior balloon 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.659
 What ever 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.030
 It depends where the little skeleton is in it 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 sitting and that was not a chancellor comes 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.740
 it on the side is somehow more like 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.009
 a swimming ring and I think so 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.359
 kind of crazy and that's it 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 others could not help it though 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.779
 We already talk about new troops then 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 I would like to talk about it 

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:30.929
 this about this this whole idea of 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.689
 the spider talked I already got that 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.799
 Often this was addressed of course 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.689
 We all know that's just a fair one 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.039
 art is he personally i find the idea 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.539
 from this spider really really cool 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.619
 because actually what she does that has 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.179
 Now think about it a bit 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.009
 made and you could spider this 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.469
 used for that the opponent 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 slows down and this units 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.529
 would slow down then so to speak well 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630
 non-enemy units slowed down 

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:58.829
 but in the end enemy 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.359
 defense, of course, slows down when 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.889
 you would have them in the little castle 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.139
 So they also shoot a spiderweb 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:06.090
 or so spit sludge around 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.640
 with this donation would be a slippery pampe 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.280
 then almost the enemy army the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.790
 attacking you in your village 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.930
 be slowed down 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.000
 I personally have to say that 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.140
 really cool find the idea in addition 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.780
 really cool again 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.680
 just with those with the transporters 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.959
 I always care about things 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.069
 somehow relatively uncertain what and how 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.390
 which should actually work 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.349
 or if it's somehow easy and 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.510
 Roll is mainly because that's one 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.129
 a bit out of focus, this picture is what 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.810
 one finds there in the net again and again 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.730
 that somehow looks like that 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.849
 just someone with photoshop altogether 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.590
 cheap on it slapped violently on everyone 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 fierce cool I would find it if that 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.560
 actually would take place and 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.950
 Sometime new troupe come 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.329
 would 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 Of course it is difficult because 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.720
 many always say English fans exist 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.799
 us always new troops and then if you 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.000
 when you summit new troops 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.139
 basically just my race in the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.829
 Replay on if that's not a bit 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.450
 continue lava 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.280
 and definitely if you have a new one 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.109
 troop that is like a moped for 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.329
 For example, if you have a new troupe 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.150
 or a new hero is initialized 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.669
 and send in the field and say 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.500
 you have no idea now 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.000
 transporter or a spider then has to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.019
 it's really blatant because you imagine 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.220
 not before a lot of work behind it 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.840
 infected then need to become thoughtful 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.030
 how they annoy that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.889
 that means this spider how many hit 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.870
 points how fast attacks like years 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.549
 faster and how much slows down the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.329
 the troops slowing them down a lot 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.099
 slows the archer to 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.159
 example as well as slow these 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.530
 archers that they afterwards 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.209
 just attack slower for 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.829
 specific period but how much 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.720
 you can do that slower without that 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.220
 this group you will be incredibly op 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.930
 then somehow just spin 23 takes 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.370
 he magician behind and then do that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.359
 Spiders are slowing everything down 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.040
 maybe a little tanki too 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.229
 or does heels fall over it and heels 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.909
 then the rest is just folded away 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.739
 then transporters fly over it 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.840
 to the transporter dry then no 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.669
 I know one end because of goblins 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.349
 in the middle of the camp and the goblins 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.569
 just take off the top of it 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.909
 galaxy with no idea so there is 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.280
 yes all sorts of possibilities you 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.629
 can then imagine in the end 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.590
 sleep mode from skype message 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.460
 and that's a bit too 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.260
 that you always have to think 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.260
 new troops are actually reads 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.259
 there had now actually the good 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.389
 is just waiting in james bond love that 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.550
 this new steam behind a total of four 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.009
 new magic game I'm right 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.590
 really tasty idea but it still lies 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.939
 a bit of mature I tell 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.439
 you follow the next one because that 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.550
 Town Hall small and I believe that could 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.520
 pretty cool actually would be there 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.449
 you can do that inspired by me 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.009
 too bad that you can not get out of the 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.610
 Replay directly into the next replay 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.270
 can jump 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.289
 that was a lot more relaxed that way 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.460
 I've already seen why I'm watching 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.270
 give me that again what is going on with 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.710
 my race 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.659
 By the way, I also wanted to be in 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.639
 Apologize again that we do not 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.009
 managed to upload a sequel 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.780
 Yesterday I also followed you 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.729
 Uploaded over this clear cup 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.349
 the problem with me is the audio track 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.270
 unfortunately not turned down and therefore 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.370
 female fans a bit over the top 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.110
 and for that I apologize to myself 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.430
 is the video really well received and 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.030
 I'm still the idea 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.680
 pretty cool 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.969
 Now it is very happy to superstar 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.729
 if you do not know the video 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.139
 Well you saw her concert 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.759
 then already understands everything you do I have 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.469
 I 'm very focused on the 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.810
 Imagine super super super super great 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.520
 Thank you, that you will never be so nice 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.330
 wat not quite so in the comments 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.830
 be disengaged 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.319
 I know that's shit if that's what 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.490
 but I happen to be honest 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.469
 've changed and he then 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.389
 quite funny after the race then 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.889
 no longer belongs just to be like that 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.120
 the ones before the render and I have it 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.349
 do not check again because of me 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.990
 but actually I went out 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.589
 something changed when I get a video 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.670
 so edges now, yes, happens sometimes 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.950
 otherwise 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.480
 It's better to be here, too 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.680
 little blood with the fat we now 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.210
 also do not necessarily have to look 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.800
 but if I'm alive I forget 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.050
 always what else happens in common 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.310
 doing here donors donate there 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.430
 here without the magician level-5 either 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.990
 bad ok blood right over here 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.110
 bad king from actually more 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.660
 seen the consumers there are 96 but 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.010
 true king falls relatively fast 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.840
 and then where do they generally hold 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.460
 attacking it with only one unit 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.180
 So without the archers I can 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.010
 to understand that 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.540
 I always go with yours 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.040
 the coblins attack but without the 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.770
 kobolde I find age a lot for me like that 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.970
 a little bit of the thing is mines and 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.740
 collectors are just not just times 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.460
 outside, and that's why you are 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.500
 problem if you now without bullets 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.670
 attack how are they then by the 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.200
 come through and in the meantime the 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.210
 going through the walls rather sooner 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.260
 from projector two bombs still 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.780
 not quite as bad but still a 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.620
 failed to start 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.740
 it belongs to a giant of the Rhine 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.690
 bounced and beautiful magician with it 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.920
 took 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.500
 the commerz pretty was once quite 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.850
 Yummy I did not think so 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.520
 my that's just fine with it 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.600
 and has two gold camps 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.250
 not so many people were taken along 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.240
 The reward of the gold is rewarded 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.100
 all times I lx you alemannic that 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.570
 was who I was just too 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.090
 a lot of energy but nothing cost me 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.050
 I like it when people try something like that 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.340
 and now he is coming to a king of 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.220
 At the top of the steamer, you get yourself 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.690
 buy a bit of music like me 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.460
 simply run better 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.600
 for the spans to see off or 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.010
 maybe the queen also knew that 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.080
 the steam is already running until she is there 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.969
 is therefore quite honestly think so clever 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.739
 i am not the queen and i am 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:25.360
 so just go back to the 

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:28.929
 Queen who was looking forward to a toll 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.679
 destroy so much we say come already 

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:33.909
 again to the end against our clear 

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:36.849
 By the way, we are still doing quite well 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:38.529
 are now only 37 people and 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:39.939
 our first becomes clear now 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:42.369
 sometime soon 

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:44.110
 as soon as I find the time for it 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:47.349
 asking people to come out oh my 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.759
 God had to call me there too 

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:51.399
 press one sees that the queen already 

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:52.809
 Thinking back to it pays me off 

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.879
 with an ouch want to do that 

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:56.829
 a lot of fun 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:58.059
 Thanks for watching if it's you 

00:07:56.829 --> 00:07:59.319
 I like the idea 

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:01.149

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:04.959
