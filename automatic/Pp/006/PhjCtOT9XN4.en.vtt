of<00:01:40.740> them<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.360> its<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.869> expensive<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
of them and its really expensive if you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.340 
of them and its really expensive if you
haven't<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> too<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.479> cars<00:01:45.780> so

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
haven't got that too then get cars so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
haven't got that too then get cars so
that's<00:01:46.680> 160<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> car<00:01:47.880> except<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> ones

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that's 160 a car except for the ones

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840
