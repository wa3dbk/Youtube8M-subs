burning<00:00:08.519> fat

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
burning fat

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.850 
burning fat
should<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.740> high-intensity<00:00:10.740> interval

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
should it be high-intensity interval

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.850 
should it be high-intensity interval
training<00:00:11.280> or<00:00:12.150> should<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.540> slower<00:00:13.080> gradual

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860

training or should it be slower gradual
easier<00:00:14.370> cardio<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.179> he<00:00:15.630> asks<00:00:16.049> about<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
easier cardio and then he asks about the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.599 
easier cardio and then he asks about the
release<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> cortisol

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
release of cortisol

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.359 
release of cortisol
well<00:00:18.270> I'll<00:00:18.480> address<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.170> cortisol<00:00:19.680> aspect<00:00:20.189> in

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
well I'll address the cortisol aspect in

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.759 
well I'll address the cortisol aspect in
another<00:00:20.730> video<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.869> when<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> comes<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
another video but when it comes to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.519 
another video but when it comes to
burning<00:00:23.550> fat<00:00:23.820> without<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> doubt<00:00:25.140> slow<00:00:26.480> gradual

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
burning fat without a doubt slow gradual

consistent long boring icky yucky cardio

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.880 
consistent long boring icky yucky cardio
is<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.740> best<00:00:31.980> why<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.230> because<00:00:34.230> number

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
is the best why is that because number

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
is the best why is that because number
one<00:00:35.160> you're<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> breath<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.780> you're

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
one you're not out of breath so you're

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
one you're not out of breath so you're
getting<00:00:37.260> plenty<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> oxygen<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
getting plenty of oxygen and in the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.930 
getting plenty of oxygen and in the
presence<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> oxygen<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:40.379> body<00:00:40.739> burns<00:00:41.100> fat

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
presence of oxygen our body burns fat

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
presence of oxygen our body burns fat
instead<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> sugar<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> remember

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
instead of sugar and you got to remember

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
instead of sugar and you got to remember
this<00:00:44.820> our<00:00:45.300> body<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.899> very<00:00:46.110> efficient<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this our body is very efficient it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.490 
this our body is very efficient it
doesn't<00:00:47.309> burn<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.879> lot<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.090> calories

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
doesn't burn a lot of calories

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
doesn't burn a lot of calories
regardless<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.800> you're<00:00:50.010> doing<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
regardless of what you're doing so this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.860 
regardless of what you're doing so this
means<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:52.469> body<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.190> burn<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.090> lot<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> fat

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
means for your body to burn a lot of fat

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
means for your body to burn a lot of fat
while<00:00:55.140> doing<00:00:55.469> cardio<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> lot

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
while doing cardio you got to do a lot

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.229 
while doing cardio you got to do a lot
of<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.920> without<00:00:58.920> getting<00:00:59.219> tired

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of it without getting tired

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.260 
of it without getting tired
that's<00:01:00.809> why<00:01:01.140> cardio<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.160> involves<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> legs

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
that's why cardio that involves the legs

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.590 
that's why cardio that involves the legs
is<00:01:03.719> most<00:01:04.470> effective<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
is most effective because you can do it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
is most effective because you can do it
for<00:01:06.780> long<00:01:06.990> periods<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> time<00:01:07.890> without<00:01:08.130> your

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
for long periods of time without your

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.060 
for long periods of time without your
legs<00:01:08.700> wearing<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> use<00:01:10.799> your

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
legs wearing out and when you use your

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
legs wearing out and when you use your
legs<00:01:11.280> because<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.060> legs<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.420> strong<00:01:12.750> they

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
legs because your legs are strong they

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.190 
legs because your legs are strong they
don't<00:01:13.530> become<00:01:14.210> anaerobic<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.930> words

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
don't become anaerobic in other words

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
don't become anaerobic in other words
your<00:01:16.740> legs<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.250> become<00:01:17.810> overwhelmed<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
your legs don't become overwhelmed and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
your legs don't become overwhelmed and
start<00:01:19.500> burning<00:01:19.710> sugar

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
start burning sugar

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.480 
start burning sugar
so<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.509> why<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.590> bodybuilders<00:01:23.250> getting

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
so that's why when bodybuilders getting

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.149 
so that's why when bodybuilders getting
ready<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.790> shows<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.750> 30<00:01:25.290> minutes<00:01:25.439> 40

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
ready for shows they do 30 minutes 40

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
ready for shows they do 30 minutes 40
minutes<00:01:26.189> 50<00:01:26.970> minutes<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.390> cardio<00:01:27.780> sometimes

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
minutes 50 minutes of cardio sometimes

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
minutes 50 minutes of cardio sometimes
twice<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> day<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.729> order<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.270> burn<00:01:30.540> enough

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
twice a day in order to burn enough

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.859 
twice a day in order to burn enough
calories<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:32.340> create<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> calorie<00:01:33.210> deficit<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
calories to create a calorie deficit to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
calories to create a calorie deficit to
eat<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.259> those<00:01:34.470> last<00:01:34.770> bits<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.280> fat<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.700> have

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
eat up those last bits of fat they have

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969 
eat up those last bits of fat they have
on<00:01:36.000> their<00:01:36.150> bodies<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:37.409> people<00:01:37.710> don't

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
on their bodies and what people don't

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.270 
on their bodies and what people don't
understand<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.350> cardio<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.920> they're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
understand is that cardio when they're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.789 
understand is that cardio when they're
on<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> treadmill<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.390> elliptical<00:01:42.799> or

the harder you can make that

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.550 
the harder you can make that
cardiovascular<00:02:09.420> activity<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.349> more

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
cardiovascular activity the more

calories<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.340> will<00:02:11.489> burn<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.540> you're

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
calories you will burn so if you're

treadmill the more calories you will

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.640 
treadmill the more calories you will
burn<00:02:17.470> would<00:02:18.280> become<00:02:18.750> breathtakingly<00:02:19.750> huge<00:02:20.170> no

burn would become breathtakingly huge no

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.860 
burn would become breathtakingly huge no
but<00:02:21.490> if<00:02:21.580> I'm<00:02:21.670> gonna<00:02:21.760> spend<00:02:21.910> 30<00:02:22.420> minutes<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.840> a

treadmill I want it to be effective so
this<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.900> why<00:02:26.080> if<00:02:26.380> somebody<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.860> out<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.130> shape

this is why if somebody is out of shape

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.140 
this is why if somebody is out of shape
or<00:02:27.850> they<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.290> burn<00:02:29.440> lots<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.980> fat<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.850> got

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
to be in great shape to train that way

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.760 
to be in great shape to train that way
number<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.750> number<00:03:11.080> two<00:03:11.230> because<00:03:11.530> you're

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
number one and number two because you're

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.080 
number one and number two because you're
not<00:03:11.860> doing<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.280> for<00:03:12.430> tremendously<00:03:12.880> long

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
not doing it for tremendously long

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.730 
not doing it for tremendously long
periods<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.570> time<00:03:13.780> you're<00:03:13.990> not<00:03:14.110> burning<00:03:14.410> lots

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
periods of time you're not burning lots

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.120 
periods of time you're not burning lots
of<00:03:14.920> calories<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.780> does<00:03:17.440> improve<00:03:17.860> your

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
of calories but it does improve your

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.240 
of calories but it does improve your
cardiovascular<00:03:19.120> performance<00:03:19.860> much<00:03:20.860> better

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
cardiovascular performance much better

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.840 
cardiovascular performance much better
or<00:03:21.550> much<00:03:21.820> greater<00:03:22.270> than<00:03:22.930> slow<00:03:23.350> gradual<00:03:24.340> cardio

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
or much greater than slow gradual cardio

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.620 
or much greater than slow gradual cardio
so<00:03:25.780> it's<00:03:26.290> sort<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:27.000> double-edged<00:03:28.000> sword<00:03:28.030> if

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
so it's sort of a double-edged sword if

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.740 
so it's sort of a double-edged sword if
you<00:03:29.110> want<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.350> improve<00:03:29.709> your<00:03:29.920> cardiovascular

ability you have to then do cardio they

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.550 
ability you have to then do cardio they
get<00:03:34.240> your<00:03:34.390> breathing<00:03:34.600> deeply<00:03:35.020> get<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.410> out<00:03:35.530> of
