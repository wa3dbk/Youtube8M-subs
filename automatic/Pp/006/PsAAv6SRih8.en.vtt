00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 if the truth that we are very happy 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.540
 with the activity that was developed is the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
 first dance of the senior area 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 we call all the retired centers 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 and good today this event became a reality 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 and good today is the first kick of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 every month there will be an event 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.170
 for the elderly in which they go to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.289
 develop and they will be able to enjoy 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.470
 to be together and share an afternoon 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 dancing eating and enjoying good 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.510
 this is what the mayor luis 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 Andreotti asked us to articulate with 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.200
 all areas so that grandparents 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 of this content and can develop 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.070
 all the activities that they do 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 both good and shared among all 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 retired centers the truth that happened 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 the 300 grandparents so good them 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.559
 we were counting that the next one already 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 we have to do down in the gym 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.579
 bigger and better the idea is to go 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.140
 adding alternatives as a band 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.960
 playing so that they can enjoy 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 of this show and the dance that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 them so much of good it gives if they like 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.390
 it's the first great gram dance that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.700
 we made this year and well this after 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.350
 will continue to do a dance more for 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.970
 month in different places for its 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.030
 people like to dance and it's not 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.440
 sitting can be reported there on wood 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.310
 thousand 956 the former retired house the cute 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.540
 participate and share this essence of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.789
 life not because I think that if 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.460
 we are always at home what 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:34.750
 first you throw the cloth and the bed does not 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.220
 and this dance is the movement 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.800
 body that encourages you to be well and 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.479
 take out all the things that are happening in 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.200
 everything that is around us this 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.800
 is negative and this is positive when 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 so there 's a reason people leave is 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.700
 feel more animated with more desire to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.369
 Live the life 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 we are very happy all very very 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.340
 happy of this mayor andreotti 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.320
 it has been agreed in the retirees that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.149
 we come here it seems very good that 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.610
 try to help the grandparents who are 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.910
 there are many grandparents who need and are 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.239
 very helpless and then of this 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.400
 so they are closer to each other them 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.980
 they have a little more joy and a little 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.500
 more contention the people all that 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.560
 they want to dance and if they play cumbia they want 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.660
 combia and they put 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.660
