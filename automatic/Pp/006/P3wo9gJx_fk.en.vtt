for example if we put a stem cell in the

for example if we put a stem cell in the

we<00:02:17.310> thought<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.940> stem<00:02:18.240> cells<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.870> the

we thought that if stem cells have the
ability<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.650> becoming<00:02:20.010> other<00:02:20.310> types<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.820> cells

then it had to be a natural process with
a<00:02:23.700> purpose<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.440> proposed<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.100> stem<00:02:26.400> cells

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.030 
interested in this whole story was that
for<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.420> first<00:03:51.510> time<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.230> had<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> potential

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
for the first time we had a potential

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.790 
for the first time we had a potential

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
explanation for what AFP was doing

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.430 
explanation for what AFP was doing
since<00:03:56.400> stem<00:03:56.700> cells<00:03:56.970> constitute<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.960> natural

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
since stem cells constitute the natural

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.950 
since stem cells constitute the natural

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
renewal system of the body then any

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.720 
renewal system of the body then any
product<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.650> would<00:04:01.800> support<00:04:02.250> stem<00:04:02.490> cell

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
product that would support stem cell

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.850 
product that would support stem cell
physiology<00:04:02.960> would<00:04:03.960> provide<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.410> wide<00:04:04.650> variety

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.160 
physiology would provide a wide variety
of<00:04:05.190> benefits<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:06.630> we<00:04:06.750> had<00:04:06.960> with

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
of benefits and that's what we had with

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.340 
of benefits and that's what we had with
AFA<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.490> we<00:04:08.610> proposed<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.150> AFA<00:04:09.720> supported

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
AFA so we proposed that AFA supported

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.770 
AFA so we proposed that AFA supported
stem<00:04:10.590> cell<00:04:10.800> physiology<00:04:11.490> for<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.330> first<00:04:12.540> time

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
stem cell physiology for the first time

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.800 
stem cell physiology for the first time
we<00:04:13.020> had<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.170> possible<00:04:13.680> explanation<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.480> we<00:04:15.600> went

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
we had a possible explanation so we went

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.660 
we had a possible explanation so we went
in<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.020> lab<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.410> studied<00:04:16.770> the<00:04:16.890> effect<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.340> AFA

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
in the lab and studied the effect of AFA

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.030 
in the lab and studied the effect of AFA
on<00:04:17.760> stem<00:04:18.060> cells<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.750> rapidly<00:04:19.440> discovered

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
on stem cells and rapidly discovered

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.300 
on stem cells and rapidly discovered
that<00:04:20.220> Howard<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:20.700> policies<00:04:21.239> was<00:04:21.450> right

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
that Howard I policies was right

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.250 
that Howard I policies was right
consuming<00:04:23.310> AFA<00:04:23.790> led<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.300> an<00:04:24.420> increase<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
consuming AFA led to an increase in the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.230 
consuming AFA led to an increase in the
number<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.650> circulating<00:04:26.280> stem<00:04:26.670> cells<00:04:26.940> and

number of circulating stem cells and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.030 
number of circulating stem cells and
since<00:04:27.930> many<00:04:28.110> studies<00:04:28.590> have<00:04:28.620> shown<00:04:29.010> that

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
since many studies have shown that

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.400 
since many studies have shown that

we were onto something big we then

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.870 
we were onto something big we then
