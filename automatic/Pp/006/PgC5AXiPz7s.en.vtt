00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.070
 Nine people I'm gonna get you guys 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.750
 to a new video marginal today 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.639
 I want you something dias choice 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 imagine because currently the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.830
 only dlc for the one already 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.449
 can unlock for the lowered game 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.189
 All other weapons can be used for 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 example to be so rushed to expect that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 Also certain other servers climb there 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 for example, this on facebook post 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.689
 Can you look up a bit? 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.219
 and then someday can not do that too 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.110
 such a first impression video to make 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.750
 but you have to unlock the selection 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.399
 ten scort operators and ten 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 minutes to spend the helicopter it is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.809
 So no matter if I transport helicopter 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.399
 skoda an christel kapp just ten 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.860
 minutes are not necessary 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.700
 the piece be network there are just as they 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 not yet on the table 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.489
 you could do that a bit 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.559
 so test the selection in the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 melee damage is so one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 little different than in battlefield 3 and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.789
 also in general for pdw it is now yes 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.980
 a rather unusual value for it 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.510
 shoots with a firing rate of 900 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 bullets per minute which of course a lot 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.890
 high but she only has 20 plus one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.479
 shot and there is no magazine 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.670
 extensions more like in battlefield 3 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 why the weapon echoes through the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 Fire rate and low ball number very much 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 but she is empty quickly but she lives 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.939
 really really fast after 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.880
 compared to the previous part of the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.040
 recoil is very noticeable strong 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.780
 top right so that's not so without 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.509
 for grad 20, that's it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.950
 far outstrips and the multiplier in the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.750
 first shot you will not get any more 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 as low as in battlefield 3 there 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
 it was the case when i had the mini burst 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.259
 the first shot he even has one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.509
 recoil of 0 5 when he was even 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 lower than the rest of mine 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.140
 Impression, I would say it now 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.460
 is not that extreme anymore 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.229
 I would not say too high 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.329
 But it is not as low as 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.149
 in bern 4 3 she has in the spill 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.690
 my eyes are looking out 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.250
 made improvements 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.290
 3, she was a little bit over there as well 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.700
 this is exactly where the crosshairs look 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.160
 significantly smaller from so but you can 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.900
 play much more offensive and the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.330
 Scatter visor if you are 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.340
 moved that was also in battlefield 3 like that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.750
 really bad, but first 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.580
 sometimes not be in the visor and the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.090
 because of course all directions 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.280
 shot 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.840
 this is not really so here 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 the fall you shoot a bit clear 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.890
 the scatters more than in the stand but one 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.300
 It is not that high anymore 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.490
 is still completely normal, the weapon 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.080
 So play there even more offensive 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.270
 but she is still standing 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.460
 right now so look here 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.100
 his two threesome stock market really 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.840
 In a short while the balls are scattering 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.750
 they are not exactly accurate 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.430
 natural longer stock market comes to 56 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.400
 then they go a little bit further 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.110
 outward but overall she stops 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.460
 still limits that is not so 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.410
 bad I have partly already 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.510
 once match had twenties in 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.580
 beaten and struck permanent fire 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.660
 So you should definitely do it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.520
 avoid but also with longer burst 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.150
 Spill is not my eyes 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.250
 so bad 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.989
 Overall , I would say that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.580
 selection is compared to 4 3 yet 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.260
 it looks significantly different 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.270
 offensive you can be a bit longer 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.580
 boers make that more likely in the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.510
 visor if you move up to there 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.250
 higher damage 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.840
 everything points to it a bit 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 that's a bit more aggressive now 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.150
 just so a pw is to be used 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.500
 not necessarily my thing but you 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.090
 she can play that way already 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 That's why you should also sat down 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.269
 adapt this principle as possible so 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.340
 in close combat visor 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.800
 I now reflexively abuse and again 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.570
 battle pack although they are yes now 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.340
 You can get that a little earlier 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.140
 Immediately out of the case is afterwards 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.780
 I would never miss information 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.120
 to be exact because we play offensive 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.269
 can be such things to amplifiers 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.790
 the high recoil not so convenient 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.900
 the silencer is always on it 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.640
 you can not change that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.410
 that's why the whole essays fall 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.060
 education brake and co all away and 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.560
 that's why you turn off all the sales 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.750
 wants to be happy too soon comes already so 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.739
 I did not pack the battle early 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.940
 bad I 'm looking forward to it 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.870
 would like essays a little earlier 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.120
 can unlock 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.980
 and there is just the muffler 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.480
 duty at the handle can actually 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.460
 Overall, do not do that much wrong 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.270
 no matter which one one takes you will already 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.130
 Law 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.930
 I can give them a short performance 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.190
 taken hold of the burst 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.110
 to be able to hold it a bit longer 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.610
 that was really good in this case 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.410
 You can stay here on the matters 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.820
 resorted to a little bit longer 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.920
 mini is the best support 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.900
 definitely not a problem 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.670
 but since you also often to the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.700
 melee comfort zone weapon lost shortly 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.170
 Alright, but also okay 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.410
 The ergonomic grip is in turn 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.970
 totally okay but just the short handle 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.890
 I would like something more 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.900
 but I would say you can 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.240
 theoretically every good 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.490
 use and so can the us choice 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.920
 once a really nice close range 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.810
 weapon play because of the damage height 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.960
 is quite languid ammo you only have 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.070
 fire rate the other scatter has everything 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.260
 changed a bit to 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.330
 Battlefield 3 is a total of one 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.190
 other weapon 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.590
 Nevertheless, I like it for his pdw 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.900
 as an offensive with a high error rate as well 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.190
 a bit of precision power is behind 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.870
 she really good and I would 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.690
 but recommend retaining the playful 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.740
 get used to it because of the 20 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.520
 shot you had to stop a bit 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.170
 watch out 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.400
 two adversaries already physically dead 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.170
 the third one is starting to get involved 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.490
 the ball number but what you have to 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.680
 Watch out for the weapons 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.320
 But otherwise definitely recommended 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.420
 yes that 's it with this first impression 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.830
 to choose the other weapons I will 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.270
 now understood why test that me 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.900
 Someone else does a bit 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.550
 invite 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.010
 I'll forget about mine anyway 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.450
 trying to think about it and that was with 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.450
 this video hides three people
