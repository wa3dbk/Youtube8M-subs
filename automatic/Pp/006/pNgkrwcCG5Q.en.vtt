here now that we would have as they as

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.940 
here now that we would have as they as
the<00:03:00.959> vehicle<00:03:01.959> drives<00:03:02.169> long<00:03:02.409> maybe<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.799> can

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
the vehicle drives long maybe you can

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.800 
the vehicle drives long maybe you can
describe<00:03:03.040> what<00:03:03.519> we're<00:03:03.639> seeing<00:03:03.819> yeah<00:03:04.359> as<00:03:04.569> you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
describe what we're seeing yeah as you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.479 
describe what we're seeing yeah as you
as<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.079> would<00:03:05.409> see<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.799> screen<00:03:06.129> as<00:03:06.430> the

of these vector of these points are

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.140 
of these vector of these points are
collected<00:03:41.169> now<00:03:41.620> how<00:03:42.010> does<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.400> vehicle<00:03:42.940> know

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
collected now how does this vehicle know

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.449 
collected now how does this vehicle know
its<00:03:43.479> position<00:03:44.229> and<00:03:44.409> so<00:03:45.069> you<00:03:45.129> can<00:03:45.310> establish

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
its position and so you can establish

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.210 
its position and so you can establish
the<00:03:46.120> position<00:03:46.599> of<00:03:46.659> these<00:03:46.810> features<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.739> uses<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the position of these features it uses a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.300 
the position of these features it uses a
very<00:03:48.519> high<00:03:48.790> accuracy<00:03:49.440> inertial<00:03:50.440> GPS<00:03:50.979> sister

very high accuracy inertial GPS sister

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.610 
very high accuracy inertial GPS sister
inertial<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:51.940> GPS<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:53.049> different<00:03:53.440> dirt

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
inertial and GPS and a different dirt

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.800 
inertial and GPS and a different dirt
reckoning<00:03:54.010> system<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.790> uses<00:03:54.970> wheel<00:03:55.299> sensors

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
reckoning system it uses wheel sensors

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.800 
reckoning system it uses wheel sensors
and<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:57.310> all<00:03:57.519> of<00:03:57.549> these<00:03:57.790> are<00:03:57.970> put<00:03:58.180> together<00:03:58.299> to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
and so all of these are put together to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.719 
and so all of these are put together to
accurately<00:03:59.470> position<00:04:00.129> where<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.519> system

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
accurately position where the system

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.210 
accurately position where the system
where<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.120> regulars<00:04:01.569> okay<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.560> then<00:04:03.069> it

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
where the regulars okay and then it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.710 
where the regulars okay and then it
looks<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.489> what's<00:04:03.879> this<00:04:04.000> attached<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.599> the

this<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.709> very<00:04:17.919> useful<00:04:17.979> especially<00:04:18.400> in<00:04:18.909> areas

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
this is very useful especially in areas

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.480 
this is very useful especially in areas
where<00:04:19.630> we<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:19.930> not<00:04:20.050> get<00:04:20.290> gps<00:04:20.740> or<00:04:20.890> when<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 
where we do not get gps or when the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.090 
where we do not get gps or when the

absorb so we process this data and then

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.410 
absorb so we process this data and then
use<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:47.020> for<00:04:47.290> creating<00:04:47.950> richer<00:04:48.430> data<00:04:48.730> data<00:04:49.150> set

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420

many cities are going to be mapped using
this<00:05:43.210> technology<00:05:43.830> are<00:05:44.830> we<00:05:45.070> in<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.310> process<00:05:45.700> of

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
this technology are we in the process of

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.280 
this technology are we in the process of
rolling<00:05:45.910> out<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.420> North<00:05:46.660> America<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.080> Europe

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
rolling out in North America and Europe

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.560 
rolling out in North America and Europe
or<00:05:47.800> so<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:50.340> product<00:05:51.340> deployment<00:05:51.850> plan<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.360> by

or so the product deployment plan and by
end<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:52.990> year<00:05:53.020> we<00:05:53.500> expect<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:53.950> roll<00:05:55.140> 20<00:05:56.140> 40

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
end of the year we expect to roll 20 40

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.860 
end of the year we expect to roll 20 40
cities<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:57.160> so<00:05:57.700> then<00:05:57.850> you'll<00:05:58.060> have<00:05:58.240> when<00:05:58.660> will

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870
