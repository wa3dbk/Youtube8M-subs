00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.360 
so we kept almost all River goes except
man<00:01:47.940> now<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.690> have<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.800> but<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.190> did<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
man now we have it all up but we did a

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.360 
man now we have it all up but we did a
bunch<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.910> with<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.870> game<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.800> we

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
bunch now with with this game but we

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.190 
bunch now with with this game but we
didn't<00:01:53.850> win<00:01:54.120> all<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.300> our<00:01:54.450> home<00:01:54.600> games<00:01:54.900> which

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
didn't win all of our home games which

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
didn't win all of our home games which
heck<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.979> guess<00:01:56.190> thought<00:01:56.400> they<00:01:56.520> could<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
heck I guess thought they could do that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.250 
heck I guess thought they could do that
but<00:01:57.840> anyway<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.340> where<00:01:59.880> we<00:01:59.910> are<00:02:00.260> cleanses

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260

excellent<00:02:04.290> plan<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:05.550> could<00:02:05.910> run<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.330> these

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

Todd<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.220> little<00:04:18.340> bit<00:04:18.700> that's<00:04:19.420> good<00:04:19.630> I'm<00:04:20.440> three

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
Todd a little bit that's good I'm three

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.820 
Todd a little bit that's good I'm three
and<00:04:20.920> three<00:04:21.160> what<00:04:21.370> flexing<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.590> two<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.800> row

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
and three what flexing and two in a row

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.150 
and three what flexing and two in a row
I<00:04:23.950> guess<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.580> good<00:04:25.320> because<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.560> had<00:04:26.680> patent

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160

alone

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
alone

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.089 
alone
thought<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.259> would<00:04:30.349> have<00:04:30.469> happened<00:04:30.889> in<00:04:31.039> the

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
thought that would have happened in the

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.390 
thought that would have happened in the
last<00:04:31.219> 40<00:04:31.669> years<00:04:31.699> but<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.330> don't<00:04:32.509> guess<00:04:32.659> it<00:04:32.689> has

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
last 40 years but I don't guess it has

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.040 
last 40 years but I don't guess it has
but<00:04:34.400> anyway<00:04:34.669> we've<00:04:35.210> done<00:04:35.389> some<00:04:35.599> first<00:04:35.810> this
