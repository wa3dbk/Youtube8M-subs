in<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:46.620> opinion<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.219> mean<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.550> could<00:00:47.820> wear<00:00:48.030> this

in my opinion I mean you could wear this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
in my opinion I mean you could wear this
really<00:00:48.539> wherever<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.440> wanted<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.030> me

your<00:04:33.740> crease<00:04:33.979> I<00:04:34.220> know<00:04:34.340> me<00:04:34.580> putting<00:04:34.910> that<00:04:35.000> right

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
just so it creates kind of a bit of a

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.890 
just so it creates kind of a bit of a
gradient<00:04:40.430> effect<00:04:40.610> then<00:04:41.419> going<00:04:41.630> in<00:04:41.750> with<00:04:41.780> a
