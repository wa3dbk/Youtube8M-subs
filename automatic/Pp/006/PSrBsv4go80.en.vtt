especially glow on the dark paint the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.359 
especially glow on the dark paint the
eyeballs<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> glow-in-the-dark<00:01:18.299> paint

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
eyeballs got a glow-in-the-dark paint

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
eyeballs got a glow-in-the-dark paint
and<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.939> depends<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:22.110> type<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> sunlight

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and it depends on what type of sunlight

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
and it depends on what type of sunlight
too<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.400> far<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.909> uh<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.600> what's<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.020> like

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
too as far as uh well what's up of like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440 
too as far as uh well what's up of like
I<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> works<00:01:26.580> better<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.150> you're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I think it works better if you're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
I think it works better if you're
sitting<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> natural<00:01:28.259> sunlight<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
sitting in natural sunlight because the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
sitting in natural sunlight because the
whole<00:01:29.729> controller<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.450> its<00:01:30.720> prey<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.259> this

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
whole controller is its prey in this

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.370 
whole controller is its prey in this
paint<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.600> depending<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> light

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
paint so you know depending on the light

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
paint so you know depending on the light
like<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> said<00:01:34.950> sometimes<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.610> whole<00:01:35.820> controller

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like I said sometimes a whole controller

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
like I said sometimes a whole controller
in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.799> green<00:01:38.119> gives<00:01:39.119> off

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in the back of this the green gives off

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
in the back of this the green gives off
a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.659> blow<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.860> eyes<00:01:41.070> glow<00:01:41.430> more

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
a little blow to the eyes glow more

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.510 
a little blow to the eyes glow more
because<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> white

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
because you know it was put on the white

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.060 
because you know it was put on the white
paint<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.659> sticks<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:47.340> better<00:01:47.899> but

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
paint so it sticks out a lot better but

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
paint so it sticks out a lot better but
this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.159> pretty<00:01:50.369> cool<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> d-pad
