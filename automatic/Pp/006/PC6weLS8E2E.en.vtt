appears<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.510> have<00:00:41.600> change<00:00:41.930> that<00:00:42.230> much<00:00:42.530> that's

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
appears to have change that much that's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.430 
appears to have change that much that's
until<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.820> really<00:00:44.480> look<00:00:44.630> around<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.050> Buy<00:00:45.200> and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
until you really look around the Buy and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.530 
until you really look around the Buy and
you<00:00:45.530> start<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.130> notice<00:00:46.160> all<00:00:46.730> those<00:00:47.030> little

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
you start to notice all those little

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.390 
you start to notice all those little
touches<00:00:47.810> and<00:00:48.260> then<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:48.530> realize<00:00:48.860> how<00:00:49.100> much<00:00:49.280> of

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
touches and then you realize how much of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.970 
touches and then you realize how much of
an<00:00:49.490> upgrade<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:50.060> is<00:00:50.320> but<00:00:51.320> looking<00:00:51.500> good<00:00:51.740> and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
an upgrade it is but looking good and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.500 
an upgrade it is but looking good and
performance<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:52.730> two<00:00:52.910> very<00:00:53.210> different

but the fazer certainly doesn't

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.020 
but the fazer certainly doesn't
