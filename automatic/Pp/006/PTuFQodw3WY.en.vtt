00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.909
 May and nothing 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 yes 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
 yes 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.110
 good afternoon I am akasaka and for the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.060
 today I want to let you know and 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.510
 approve a very good fighting game in 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.460
 two dimensions as everyone will know soon 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.770
 they will take out a game similar to the style 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.500
 that I will mention next which is 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.660
 fighting climax an exceptional game of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 fight in two dimensions with characters 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.970
 compiled from several animes the game 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.239
 which I'm going to talk about is arcana heart 3 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.940
 a good game extremely difficult to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.740
 get on the internet since you can only 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.830
 find the game badly compressed in 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.870
 three dll files but well I did 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.360
 some tricks and I managed to make it work 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 that's why I want to share it with everyone 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.759
 you are well aware of what 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.160
 next in the video description 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'll leave the following link when 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.390
 download that compressed file 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.220
 they must decompress it and they will have these 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 three files 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 the files that are inside the game 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 what I'm emphasizing are to be able 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 run it the button configurator does not 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 it serves and I do not understand why x exist 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.260
 several rumors that there is a file inside 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.660
 of this game that is harmful to the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.570
 windows so please do not touch anything 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.700
 that you do not know in the second folder 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.130
 they will have a joystick configurator in 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.670
 if you have one for my luck I 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.040
 I have two and it is more comfortable to play 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.650
 anyway I tell you the buttons 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 of the game which are typical 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.509
 arrows from top to bottom left and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.549
 right and the action keys are the to 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.549
 bc daily 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.320
 ah 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.800
 well that would be all I hope you enjoy 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.050
 this great game is very possible that you 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.180
 pull the game error and if so, by 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.700
 please tell me I know what they can be 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.560
 your solutions 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.850
 I am akasaka and I say goodbye for today 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.850
 until the next 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
 Y
