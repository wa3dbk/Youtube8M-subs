00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
the outside are the minutes and then the

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.830 
the outside are the minutes and then the
one<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:39.019> blinks<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.829> think<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.129> wins

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
one that like blinks I think it wins

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.349 
one that like blinks I think it wins
yeah<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.049> one<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.319> blinks<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.090> though<00:02:44.090> on

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
yeah the one that blinks is though on

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.229 
yeah the one that blinks is though on
one<00:02:44.780> that's<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.169> hours<00:02:45.669> so<00:02:46.669> if<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.819> press<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
one that's the hours so if you press it

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.520 
one that's the hours so if you press it
you<00:02:47.980> can<00:02:48.980> see<00:02:49.129> it's<00:02:49.250> six<00:02:50.349> forty<00:02:51.849> forty<00:02:52.849> four<00:02:53.530> so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
you can see it's six forty forty four so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.020 
you can see it's six forty forty four so
yeah<00:02:55.159> and<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:57.040> guess<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.310> replacing<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
yeah and I guess this is replacing the
