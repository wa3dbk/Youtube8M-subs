super lightweight super fast laptop and

quite expensive too now the VAIO t

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
quite expensive too now the VAIO t
steals<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.730> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.120> design<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
steals a lot of that design and is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
steals a lot of that design and is
nearly<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> same<00:00:46.710> size<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.550> costs<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> lot

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
nearly the same size but it costs a lot

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.170 
nearly the same size but it costs a lot
less<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> $7.99<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:50.820> getting

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
less this is $7.99 what you're getting

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
less this is $7.99 what you're getting
though<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.600> lower<00:00:51.840> voltage<00:00:52.410> core<00:00:53.129> i5

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
though is that lower voltage core i5

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
though is that lower voltage core i5
processor<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> third<00:00:54.989> generation

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
processor now it is a third generation

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
processor now it is a third generation
so<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.219> bit<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> bump<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.030> terms

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so it's a little bit of bump up in terms

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
so it's a little bit of bump up in terms
of<00:00:57.360> speed<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.989> little<00:00:58.410> better<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.649> multitasking

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
of speed a little better at multitasking

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
of speed a little better at multitasking
and<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.030> better<00:01:00.239> integrated<00:01:00.870> graphics

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and it's got better integrated graphics

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
and it's got better integrated graphics
than<00:01:01.590> last<00:01:01.859> year<00:01:02.250> what's<00:01:03.059> also<00:01:03.210> interesting

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
than last year what's also interesting

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
than last year what's also interesting
about<00:01:03.960> these<00:01:04.080> new<00:01:04.290> ultra<00:01:04.619> books<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
about these new ultra books is that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
about these new ultra books is that
instead<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:05.880> SSD<00:01:06.330> storage<00:01:06.600> which<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.530> fast

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
instead of an SSD storage which is fast

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.730 
instead of an SSD storage which is fast
but<00:01:08.549> limited<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.119> capacity<00:01:09.290> you're<00:01:10.290> getting<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
but limited in capacity you're getting a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
but limited in capacity you're getting a
500<00:01:11.340> gigabyte<00:01:11.520> hybrid<00:01:12.270> hard<00:01:12.479> drive<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.990> now

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
500 gigabyte hybrid hard drive here now

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
500 gigabyte hybrid hard drive here now
what<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.650> means<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.250> getting<00:01:14.340> 32

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
what that means is you're getting 32

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
what that means is you're getting 32
gigabyte<00:01:15.630> SSD<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.560> addition<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> 500

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
gigabyte SSD in addition to the 500

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.149 
gigabyte SSD in addition to the 500
gigabyte<00:01:18.479> hard<00:01:18.509> drive<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.439> provides<00:01:19.799> some

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
gigabyte hard drive which provides some

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399 
gigabyte hard drive which provides some
faster<00:01:20.729> speeds<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> access<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.320> also

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
faster speeds and access but it also

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
faster speeds and access but it also
means<00:01:22.619> more<00:01:22.860> storage<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.670> funny<00:01:23.850> thing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
means more storage and the funny thing

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
means more storage and the funny thing
is<00:01:24.210> right<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.110> lot<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> laptops<00:01:25.890> are

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
is right now a lot of laptops are

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
is right now a lot of laptops are
offering<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> 500<00:01:27.360> gigabyte<00:01:27.659> hard<00:01:27.869> drive

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
offering that 500 gigabyte hard drive

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.100 
offering that 500 gigabyte hard drive
for<00:01:28.829> less<00:01:29.130> money<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:30.119> storage<00:01:30.450> less<00:01:30.840> money

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
for less money more storage less money

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
for less money more storage less money
maybe<00:01:31.860> slightly<00:01:32.159> faster<00:01:32.670> speeds<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
maybe slightly faster speeds but it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.460 
maybe slightly faster speeds but it
seems<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.020> good<00:01:34.259> compromise

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
seems like a pretty good compromise

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
seems like a pretty good compromise
right<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.820> helps<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.150> laptop<00:01:36.689> get

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
right now and it helps this laptop get

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
right now and it helps this laptop get
in<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.200> $7.99

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
in at $7.99

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.569 
in at $7.99
now<00:01:38.670> $7.99<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.900> cheap<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> laptop<00:01:41.040> but

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
now $7.99 is not cheap for a laptop but

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.429 
now $7.99 is not cheap for a laptop but
it's<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:42.000> cheap<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> Sony<00:01:42.659> Vaio<00:01:42.780> which

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it's pretty cheap for a Sony Vaio which

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's pretty cheap for a Sony Vaio which
usually<00:01:43.829> tend<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> cap<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> top<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> the

usually tend to cap the top of the
market<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.619> also<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> entry<00:01:47.430> price<00:01:47.640> last

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
because Sony makes thin laptops and now

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
because Sony makes thin laptops and now
some<00:01:55.170> companies<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.799> never<00:01:56.009> made<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> really

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
some companies have never made a really

thin laptop and an ultrabook is their
chance<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.549> show<00:01:59.790> off<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.170> instance

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
chance to show off now in this instance

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.530 
chance to show off now in this instance
this<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.159> pretty<00:02:02.369> similar<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.850> size<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.299> an<00:02:03.390> S

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
