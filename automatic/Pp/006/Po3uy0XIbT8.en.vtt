00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.859
 well, my training is in the field 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.469
 of the administration and direction of 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.740
 Companies in Madrid study and here 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.670
 madrid and then I went to make a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.830
 mba 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.369
 in Paris it was an experience for me 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.930
 interesting because the mba was in English 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 however we did it in Paris 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.700
 it was an international shipment and then 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 there were several schools that what 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.320
 they organized so the official language 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.629
 of the master was in English this 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 allowed me to improve my English and 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.170
 learn a little bit of French and get to know 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.170
 paris that I loved 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.790
 apart I have done many seminars 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.950
 international in various disciplines 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.970
 and certify me as a personal coach 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.470
 executive and corporate 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.730
 and my professional career has been 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.360
 basically since 1992 in the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.690
 scope of the consultancy first and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.479
 of corporate training 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.900
 When I discovered coaching, I understood that 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.060
 I had to diversify my work to 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.729
 side of coaching also because I 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.740
 it seemed very important it seemed very 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.320
 interesting and very effective in the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.890
 current times for the organization I 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.080
 I worked in different companies during a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.840
 time until then I decided that it was 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.690
 time to dedicate myself and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.390
 so then well with my partners in my 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.759
 company because we work in our 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.950
 own organizations and also in the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.840
 international school of coaching 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.500
 to offer what we know is a lot 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.500
 coaching 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.760
 Well, I'll tell you my pleasures more 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.950
 dear ones that are the cinema 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.930
 [Music] 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.869
 although I can not seem it but I have 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.479
 studied cinema because it's one for me 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.060
 you have something that I like has been 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.340
 quite a cinema and I love the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.860
 movies always within walking distance of the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 screen because specialists say 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.439
 that good cinema must see the time 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.720
 battle distance to see everything 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.350
 what happens very well 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.660
 I see a lot of films I really like me 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.820
 I have a lot of fun with him and my other pleasure 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.010
 is to dine with my friends and do 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.620
 high gatherings until late hours of the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.470
 dawn these are my two pleasures 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.330
 fundamentals but I must also say 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.330
 that I am lucky 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 I can only say that in my work it is 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.230
 a passion that satisfies me very much and 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.950
 that therefore for me to work is a 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.900
 pleasure and it's a fun too 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.360
 fortunately this allows me to work 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.209
 but at the same time doing it with passion 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.920
 and with a lot of enjoyment but my two 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.380
 great hobbies are these and also the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.970
 reading what happens is that sometimes one 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.680
 he can not read everything he should but 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.900
 yes we take advantage of airports and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.300
 the planes to do those readings that 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 we can not do in other occasions 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.280
 or at some time in your life 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.440
 given audiovisual production classes 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.310
 and trained people in production 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.380
 audiovisual 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.480
 and film in particular 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.180
 cinematographic 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.090
 I had the chance to work too 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.269
 in international marketing in a 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.299
 audio-visual sharing distributor 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.299
 with them and all this well 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.200
 has made me have one more contact 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.510
 direct with the world of cinema but good 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.900
 for many years especially as a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.900
 viewer 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.959
 we use a lot of cinema and 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.469
 advertising spots our formations 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.900
 it's very impactful the students take 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.599
 a very interesting memory and also it 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.099
 they take very interesting lessons and 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.410
 I believe that all movies have 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.890
 a 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.350
 yesterday I read by chance in a newspaper 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.890
 in a newspaper in a cinema section of 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.890
 management 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.079
 I was really surprised and I 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.239
 loved the article read how the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.549
 broken hugs of almodóvar looked very 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.220
 recently because it has a large 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.010
 teachings for corporate management and 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.630
 of the leadership then analyzed everything 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.580
 what they were saying and effectively 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.650
 as I have seen it this weekend 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.690
 I was reproducing all those 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.910
 those planes and those sequences and 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 it said indeed is true so 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.320
 so much I believe that all movies 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.200
 They have a lot to say to us 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.060
 executive for daily life and for 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.060
 people we can draw many lessons 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.880
 good in spain 'canarias is for me a 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.130
 passion and outside Spain as 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.620
 Latin America we are leaving now very soon 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.600
 to do courses there but he 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.440
 I certainly enjoy a lot when I'm 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.440
 in those countries 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.850
 more times more times we have been in 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.390
 last October 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.050
 now we are going to april to bogota we are going to 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.930
 I remove in May and we take in July Mexico 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.220
 and the next semester well I also think 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.490
 that in October November we will be the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.490
 weather 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.470
 I would recommend 2 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.919
 one is corporate coaching from march to 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.919
 the water 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.130
 he is one of the most relevant characters 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.530
 in the world of corporate coaching in 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.570
 the news has edited the book he 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.540
 write some of the chapters of the 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.210
 book is a book of diverse people 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.370
 of diverse authors but it edits and has 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.430
 selected these authors I think it's 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.610
 a very interesting basic book very 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.810
 practical where it describes how it works 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.330
 corporate coaching 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.180
 organizations and the other book is from a 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.650
 Very interesting spanish santiago álvarez 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.990
 the moon is called I'm not superman and in 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.300
 this book I am not superman 'lights and 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.449
 shadows' of an inner conversation 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.569
 is done is transcribed to a process of 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.550
 coaching the coach with an executive is 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.900
 the whole process and the transcription of 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.490
 This process 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.680
 I obviously suppose that they have shortened 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.050
 as it is logical but it is the transcription 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.690
 of this process and I think it teaches very 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.159
 well how can you carry out a 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.680
 coaching process and what is the effect 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.240
 that produce coaching and also 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.460
 what are the sensations that 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.400
 experience a coach along those 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.400
 months and they are the two books that 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.400
 I would recommend
