00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 It happened not very long ago ... 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 The once cheerful and colorful island of Panfu was shaken by a dark force. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 The evil wizard Krucio came to appropriate Panfu. Gray and cold, that's how he wanted to see it! 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Every day Krucio turned a colorful object into stone. Panfu seemed lost ... 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 But a panda lady knew what to do: Kamaria. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 With the magic staff from her puzzle machine, the pandas were able to resist the evil magician. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Once a day you could get the magic staff out of the riddle machine 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 but only after labyrinth has been solved. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
 However, that was no problem for the smart pandas! 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Every day they solved the labyrinth and saved pieces from their beloved Panfu. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 But Krucio would not be the strongest wizard in the world 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 if he didn't have a few mean tricks on hand. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Do you dare to stop me? 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Ha, wait and see, peesy panda! That will cost you dearly! 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 He sabotaged the riddle machine ... 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.500
 ... petrified even pets and birds! 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 But the brave pandas could not be stopped. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Together they stood strong and resisted every nasty trick ... 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.500
 ... until one day Krucio turned the puzzle machine into stone! 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Panic spread through Panfu. Is everything now lost? 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.000
 Not with Kamaria! 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 For nights she flipped through her magic books, looking for a solution. 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 Until she got THE idea. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Krucio had to be turned into a small child, 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 that does not waste any thought of bad magic! 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 She found the right spell and collected all the pandas around her. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 Only with their joint power would this spell work: 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 BABOOM! 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Krucio changed to Paultje, sweet and good. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Panfu was saved.
