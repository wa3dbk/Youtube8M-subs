00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
over the season I think Bar Hall they've

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
over the season I think Bar Hall they've
the<00:00:40.290> worst<00:00:40.469> defensive<00:00:40.890> record<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.489> can't

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the worst defensive record and I can't

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.330 
the worst defensive record and I can't
see<00:00:41.940> Western<00:00:42.870> letting<00:00:43.140> them<00:00:43.230> escape<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:44.010> second
