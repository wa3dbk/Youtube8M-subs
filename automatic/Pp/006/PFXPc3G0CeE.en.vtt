 here meaning no cooking recipes today 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.860
 Today we want 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.700
 I want to do an indoor workout 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.620
 training on podiums but stretch on seven 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.350
 exercises to do consecutively a 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.870
 another meter a charge of only 10 seconds 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.700
 tranese to the other sex then 8 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.789
 while sita use the breath 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.170
 as usual no hospital born 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.860
 however, there are seven exercises 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.260
 one behind the other among an ice cream are 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.989
 two minutes break for a total of i 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.540
 three cyclical factors depending on yours 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.579
 journey of our abilities e 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.579
 I always suggest a time like this 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.890
 if there really was really a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 excellent application for iphone allows 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 precisely to understand exactly which 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.649
 in the moment of starting again with the series 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.750
 later always use a lot also for 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.280
 atac is now really not either 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.869

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 as many push-ups as possible 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:33.030
 in the time interval in the winds 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 seconds the timer is dug then 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.670

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.899
 prepare for the next exercise 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:46.020
