00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello girls 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.740
 I came here today to show you the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.799
 Remembering having John Peter that will be 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.529
 this fragrant sachet alone here right that 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.100
 There is a smell of nature, Mom and baby. I did. 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.020
 last week and some girls in it 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.990
 they always asked me how I 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.300
 I did and I'll show you how it was. 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:36.000
 What I did right, I hope you like it. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 in a face that's good so I needed 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 health you meet me 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.739
 I found it here in the supermarket extra nÃ© 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 not clinical and tnt fabric tnt 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 I found that little dance to make 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.170
 You, because I did not have any more 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 material 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.770
 I had already used a whole task to do 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.730
 shadow sense 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.969
 so I cut it tried in a rectangle 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.729
 You can do 15 by 15 blanket. 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.630
 acrylic on the square a knot and used a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.510
 crown a tablespoon of health 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.380
 to give a scent I put 10 ml of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.439
 Mother natura baby essence in a pound 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 taste and leave it in 24 hours 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.450
 inside a plastic pot that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.259
 including the plastic pot girls I 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 I advise you not to use it, 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.009
 to eat you put a box of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.619
 plastic usually saves us 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.520
 makeup or anything like that 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.689
 so i put let 24 hours of a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.100
 day to day 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:55.950
 the essence I mixed of an eye and I 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.340
 I found it here and left the flavor for 24 hours 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 cortez tries to cut the technical note 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.969
 I put a tablespoon of flavor 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.229
 here in the middle 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.229
 I made a bundle 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:19.830
 and the other bundle with the tnt sure ok 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.730
 There I had tape of those satin ribbons. 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.489
 thin 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.720
 I bought more because I was not going to 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:32.110

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:36.160

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.580

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:48.880

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.980

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:58.599
 of lollipops 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.099
 She comes in the bag with 50 units or 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.519

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:46.540
 because I'm a perfectionist then 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.540
