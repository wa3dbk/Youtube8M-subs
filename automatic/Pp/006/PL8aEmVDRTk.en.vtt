00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
got the bottle in and I think just that

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
so now basically all you need to do is

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.090 
so now basically all you need to do is
chill<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.319> in<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.470> fridge<00:01:56.530> for<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.920> little
