detail and color or chroma and what is
really<00:04:04.530> sensitive<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.069> our<00:04:05.910> darks<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.480> lights

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.050 
really sensitive to our darks and lights
imagine<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.440> black<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.920> white<00:04:08.040> photograph<00:04:08.670> so

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
imagine a black and white photograph so

what<00:04:09.959> happens<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:10.709> JPEG<00:04:11.160> compression<00:04:11.600> and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
what happens with JPEG compression and

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.520 
what happens with JPEG compression and
this<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> really<00:04:13.470> basic<00:04:13.940> kind<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.060> shortcut

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
this is a really basic kind of shortcut

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.390 
this is a really basic kind of shortcut
definition<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:17.579> what<00:04:17.789> happens<00:04:18.329> is

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
definition of it but what happens is

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.930 
definition of it but what happens is
compression<00:04:20.400> does<00:04:21.329> color<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.620> keeps<00:04:23.250> like

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
compression does color and keeps like

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.300 
compression does color and keeps like
what<00:04:24.210> would<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.570> black<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.080> white<00:04:25.229> layer<00:04:25.470> so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
what would be a black and white layer so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:05:02.340 
what would be a black and white layer so
in<00:04:26.430> other<00:04:26.580> words

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.620 

anyway<00:05:03.350> what<00:05:04.280> do<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.490> pick<00:05:04.700> dogs<00:05:04.940> because<00:05:05.480> we

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
anyway what do you pick dogs because we

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.930 
anyway what do you pick dogs because we
would<00:05:05.780> take<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.170> orange<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:07.310> rather<00:05:07.670> than

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
would take this orange and rather than

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.500 
would take this orange and rather than
have<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.510> five<00:05:08.960> use<00:05:09.830> orange<00:05:10.460> he<00:05:11.060> would<00:05:11.240> come

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
have like five use orange he would come

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.100 
have like five use orange he would come
back<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.230> only<00:05:12.770> one<00:05:13.220> but<00:05:14.030> keep<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.570> dark<00:05:14.870> to

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
back to only one but keep the dark to

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.200 
back to only one but keep the dark to
light<00:05:15.320> so<00:05:15.680> has<00:05:16.160> this<00:05:16.340> ball<00:05:16.550> have<00:05:16.760> more<00:05:16.970> light

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
light so has this ball have more light

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.760 
light so has this ball have more light
on<00:05:17.240> it<00:05:17.450> would<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.900> lighter<00:05:18.170> shade<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.530> orange

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
on it would be a lighter shade of orange

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.370 
on it would be a lighter shade of orange
and<00:05:19.400> as<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.610> shadow<00:05:19.940> comes<00:05:20.300> down<00:05:20.570> with<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.930> darker

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
and as a shadow comes down with a darker

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.440 
and as a shadow comes down with a darker
shade<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.650> orange<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.580> would<00:05:22.700> just<00:05:22.850> keep<00:05:23.090> one

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
shade of orange you would just keep one

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.570 
shade of orange you would just keep one
shade<00:05:23.780> of<00:05:23.930> orange<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.680> use<00:05:25.010> the<00:05:25.160> luminosity

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
shade of orange and use the luminosity

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.150 
shade of orange and use the luminosity
luminosity<00:05:28.480> from<00:05:29.480> dark<00:05:29.780> to<00:05:29.870> light<00:05:30.160> to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
luminosity from dark to light to

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.310 
luminosity from dark to light to
actually<00:05:31.640> modulate<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.510> create<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.080> color

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
actually modulate and create the color

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.490 
actually modulate and create the color
that<00:05:33.590> was<00:05:33.680> originally<00:05:34.190> there<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:35.390> it's<00:05:36.380> a

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
that was originally there so it's a

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.010 
that was originally there so it's a
great<00:05:36.830> at<00:05:37.100> tricking<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.610> human<00:05:37.940> eye<00:05:38.090> wait<00:05:38.780> how

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
great at tricking the human eye wait how

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.590 
great at tricking the human eye wait how
he<00:05:39.080> knows<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.710> really<00:05:40.010> is<00:05:40.220> dumping<00:05:40.820> color

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
he knows it really is dumping color

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.500 
he knows it really is dumping color

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
100% of luminosity which then allows it
