00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.980
 We're going to jump in the sprint now. 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.139
 One hundred l of carapina I'm going to chat 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.070
 with luciano rezende and he will explain 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 for you guys 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.320
 what are the advantages of having a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.220
 sprinter and look that line 2012 is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.220
 Wonderful 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.359
 We are going to talk about some numbers today. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.560
 The vehicle is, for example, sprinter 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 is a very robust vehicle that the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.070
 it became more review last up to 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 compares with competitors around 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.309
 10 to 12 thousand revisions in our vehicle 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.410
 20 thousand kilometers revisions that for 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.739
 a customer who runs an average of 3 thousand 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.480
 Quilombos that the market will make three 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.399
 revisions of the current while our 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.500
 vehicle will do a review 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.469
 he has a more available vehicle to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.699
 work is so the benefits of the car 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 it is way better 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.949
 the sprint is the only vehicle that has 15 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 places plus one more driver 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 factory original 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.310
 nor do we have a competitor who has 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 three places two places are implemented 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.130
 and the other competitors are vans that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.860
 are adapted for Grandma 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.470
 So you have to be careful about that. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.250
 because the vehicle has all the finishing 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.140
 both safety and acoustics of 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.960
 temperature right for a vehicle van 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.360
 is the majority of competitors is the kind of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.880
 traction is then Soviet 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 parked by homokinetics or 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 our vehicle our vehicle is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.610
 differential even shows the whole 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.450
 robustness when we talk in review 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.149
 up to 320,000 km of differential wharf or 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.640
 ten years means the Mercedes is 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.570
 give a guarantee of this is because the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.799
 product is very good is important is to 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.479
 who is wanting to buy the vehicle? 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.240
 for who is looking to change the vehicle 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.040
 is looks at all the technical attributes of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 he vehicle safety 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.899
 looks at the comfort mainly this 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.179
 fixed bench and bench seat issue 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.569
 fixed bench we also have a vehicle and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.730
 in the house of 113 thousand 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.920
 of 113 thousand that is a complete car with the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.109
 bank to meet contracts for 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.599
 meet school demands where 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.150
 comfort. 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.639
 for travel vehicles for the trip 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.469
 we have more comfortable seats 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.810
 reclining is then appropriate for each 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:33.049
 situation at each operation is the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.569
 a year of guarantee and the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.620
 Our vain has 75 thousand kilometers of 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.200
 warranty without time limit so it 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.870
 saying the following is speaking it seems that the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.829
 competitor has one more guarantee one year 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.859
 and here there are only 75 thousand and eleven but it is 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.290
 People have already done a lot of research, right? 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.889
 It is this branch and the staff walks around 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.840
 3 thousand kilometers is seen that 75 thousand 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.730
 years will be two years in a little bit 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.099
 a warranty period just because it 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.930
 extrapolates in r 5 thousand and still has much 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.299
 more human a lot more a year of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 guarantee then if these items that the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.939
 People said here today are interesting. 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.310
 the customer to analyze before deciding to 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.810
 It 's a good buy, see you next week. 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.659
 but look soon we will have a 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.090
 Wonderful party here to close a 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.759
 new group a new brotherhood of the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.459
 k9 consortium that is bombarding the 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:30.769
 mercedes-benz sold if they turn and 16 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.389

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.799
 last is the opportunity now to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.989
 get a sprinter a truck in 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.509
 conditions facilitated together with the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:53.199
