00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and all of these are the same except the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.029 
and all of these are the same except the
engine<00:00:15.359> you<00:00:15.809> know<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.169> not<00:00:16.349> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.680> confuse

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
engine you know I'm not going to confuse

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.359 
engine you know I'm not going to confuse
you<00:00:17.340> well<00:00:18.090> approach<00:00:18.689> should<00:00:18.869> clear<00:00:19.079> that<00:00:19.289> up

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
you well approach should clear that up

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.290 
you well approach should clear that up
these<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.610> all<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.060> same<00:00:21.329> except<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:24.060> one

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
these are all the same except the one

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.549 
these are all the same except the one
with<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.660> hanging<00:00:26.239> hanging<00:00:27.239> top<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.899> but

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559 
with the hanging hanging top on but

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.819 
with the hanging hanging top on but
these<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.399> they<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.329> loose<00:00:33.829> we

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
these are really they really loose we

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.110 
these are really they really loose we
will<00:00:36.469> with<00:00:37.469> their<00:00:37.680> part<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
will with their part and I'm going to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.270 
will with their part and I'm going to
load<00:00:42.120> everything<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> electrolysis<00:00:43.850> tank

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
load everything in the electrolysis tank

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
load everything in the electrolysis tank
so<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.820> reason<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:48.600> taking

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so that's the reason that we're taking

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
so that's the reason that we're taking
it<00:00:49.200> apart<00:00:49.530> real<00:00:49.829> good<00:00:52.489> they're<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> right

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it apart real good they're the right

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.440 
it apart real good they're the right
boats

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
boats

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.080 
boats
you're<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:54.960> washers<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.760> we'll<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.940> all

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you're right washers so we'll be all

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
you're right washers so we'll be all
right<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:58.350> gonna<00:00:58.620> mark<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> these

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
right there I'm gonna mark one of these

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
right there I'm gonna mark one of these
cylinders<00:01:00.140> because<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.469> want<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.860> go<00:01:02.040> back

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
cylinders because I want them to go back

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.620 
cylinders because I want them to go back
on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> same<00:01:02.880> side<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.540> their<00:01:03.719> own<00:01:05.630> looks

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
on the same side that their own looks

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.499 
on the same side that their own looks
real<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:08.159> cylinder<00:01:08.729> bore<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.270> in

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
real good the cylinder bore down in

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.879 
real good the cylinder bore down in
there<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.850> looks<00:01:11.880> good<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:13.319> of<00:01:13.439> oil<00:01:13.619> on

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:13.889 
there is it looks good a lot of oil on

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:17.690 
there is it looks good a lot of oil on
it<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.139> a<00:01:16.469> better<00:01:17.100> engine

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it with this this is a better engine

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.789 
it with this this is a better engine
than<00:01:18.770> most<00:01:20.810> now<00:01:23.659> there<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.899> something<00:01:25.499> missing

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
than most now there is something missing

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.169 
than most now there is something missing
on<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.369> engine<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:30.529> the<00:01:31.529> two<00:01:31.799> little<00:01:32.179> they

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
on this engine the the two little they

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.419 
on this engine the the two little they
should<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:34.109> too<00:01:35.450> small<00:01:36.499> on<00:01:37.499> each<00:01:37.740> end<00:01:38.069> of<00:01:38.249> these

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
should be too small on each end of these

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:45.649 
should be too small on each end of these
avicii<00:01:39.209> end<00:01:39.539> of<00:01:39.749> this<00:01:42.109> wristband<00:01:44.149> they're<00:01:45.149> not

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
avicii end of this wristband they're not

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.629 
avicii end of this wristband they're not
here<00:01:46.109> they<00:01:46.590> supposed<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> little

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
here they supposed to be a little

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.959 
here they supposed to be a little
luminal<00:01:48.119> wafer<00:01:49.020> right<00:01:49.469> there<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.219> a<00:01:50.279> little

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
luminal wafer right there and a little

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.289 
luminal wafer right there and a little
aluminum<00:01:51.389> wafer<00:01:51.869> over<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.789> that<00:01:53.789> piston

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
aluminum wafer over here that piston

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.330 
aluminum wafer over here that piston
looks<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.779> good

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
looks really good

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.099 
looks really good
surprising<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.759> got<00:01:56.969> some<00:01:57.179> carbon<00:01:57.539> buildup

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
surprising it's got some carbon buildup

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.379 
surprising it's got some carbon buildup
on<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.919> but<00:01:59.700> other<00:01:59.909> than<00:02:00.149> that

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:00.389 
on it here and there but other than that

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.719 
on it here and there but other than that
it<00:02:00.569> looks<00:02:00.599> really<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.229> good

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it looks really really good

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.089 
it looks really really good
yeah<00:02:03.179> almost<00:02:03.719> every<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:04.469> apart<00:02:04.859> you

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
yeah almost every one you take apart you

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
yeah almost every one you take apart you
will<00:02:05.279> find<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.319> mark<00:02:07.319> on<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.929> what

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
will find a mark on the on them so what

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.130 
will find a mark on the on them so what
I'm<00:02:10.289> gonna<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.730> bottom<00:02:12.150> on

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I'm gonna do right here on the bottom on

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.880 
I'm gonna do right here on the bottom on
that<00:02:13.200> flange<00:02:13.800> I'm<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.730> put<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.890> punch

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
that flange I'm gonna put a little punch

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.010 
that flange I'm gonna put a little punch
mark<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.670> then<00:02:18.180> I'm<00:02:18.330> gonna<00:02:18.510> come<00:02:18.750> right<00:02:18.960> over

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
mark and then I'm gonna come right over

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.340 
mark and then I'm gonna come right over
here<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:20.370> put<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:20.880> punch<00:02:21.360> mark

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
here and put a little punch mark

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.220 
here and put a little punch mark
so<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.970> way<00:02:24.120> up<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.630> did<00:02:24.900> put<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
so that was that way up and I did put it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
so that was that way up and I did put it
on<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.470> bottom<00:02:25.650> most<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.190> time<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.520> on<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
on the bottom most of time there on the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.360 
on the bottom most of time there on the
top<00:02:26.910> sometimes<00:02:27.540> it'll<00:02:27.990> be<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.170> initial<00:02:29.160> or<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
top sometimes it'll be a initial or a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.240 
top sometimes it'll be a initial or a
number<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.750> particular<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.440> just

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
number but on this particular one just

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.480 
number but on this particular one just
for<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.140> everything's<00:02:34.830> matched<00:02:35.160> up

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
for because it's everything's matched up

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.450 
for because it's everything's matched up
and<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.450> good<00:02:36.630> shape<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:37.290> want<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.280> get

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
and it's in good shape I want it to get

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.090 
and it's in good shape I want it to get
back<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.000> right<00:02:39.150> side<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.350> right

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
back on the right side on the right

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:51.070 
back on the right side on the right
position<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:48.830> bringing<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.100> one<00:02:50.280> off

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
position so bringing that one off

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.110 
position so bringing that one off
it<00:02:52.080> looks<00:02:52.350> equally<00:02:52.830> as<00:02:53.100> good<00:02:54.290> really<00:02:55.290> good

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it looks equally as good really good

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.520 
it looks equally as good really good
so<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.970> piston<00:03:00.720> does<00:03:00.930> not<00:03:01.200> have

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
so and this this piston does not have

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.280

rods the one that was marked is this one
which<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.920> this<00:04:26.580> piston<00:04:27.380> goes<00:04:28.380> on<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.890> one<00:04:29.130> so

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
which is this piston goes on that one so

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.040 
which is this piston goes on that one so
we<00:04:29.460> want<00:04:29.670> to<00:04:29.760> keep<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.260> in<00:04:32.300> in<00:04:33.300> mind<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:33.840> we
