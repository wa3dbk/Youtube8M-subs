amazing okay so you take your four and a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
amazing okay so you take your four and a
half<00:01:38.280> inch<00:01:38.700> piece<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.020> put<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
half inch piece and you're gonna put it

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700 
half inch piece and you're gonna put it
on<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.640> side<00:01:41.780> right<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
on the right side right here and this is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.800 
on the right side right here and this is
right<00:01:44.070> where<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.329> fold<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.689> going

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
right where your fold is so it's going

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
right where your fold is so it's going
to<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:49.049> completely<00:01:49.649> perpendicular<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to be completely perpendicular up and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
to be completely perpendicular up and
down<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:52.130> okay

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
down just like that okay

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920 
down just like that okay
so<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:53.820> you're<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
so then you're going to take it up and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.130 
so then you're going to take it up and
you're<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.880> put<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> straight<00:01:57.299> down<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you're going to put it straight down and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
you're going to put it straight down and
you're<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.340> right

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you're going to put it on the very right

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.469 
you're going to put it on the very right
side<00:02:03.799> okay<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> take<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:06.270> hot

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
side okay so I'm going to take some hot

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:16.420 
side okay so I'm going to take some hot
glue<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.869> put<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.649> between

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.270 

and<00:02:17.430> again<00:02:17.670> make<00:02:17.880> sure<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.120> completely

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
and again make sure it's completely

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.910 
and again make sure it's completely
perpendicular<00:02:24.380> then<00:02:25.380> you're<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.710> take

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
perpendicular then you're going to take

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920 
perpendicular then you're going to take
your<00:02:26.070> next<00:02:26.340> piece<00:02:26.760> make<00:02:27.180> sure<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.510> edges<00:02:27.810> are

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
your next piece make sure the edges are

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.890 
your next piece make sure the edges are
sealed<00:02:29.960> get<00:02:30.960> some<00:02:31.170> more<00:02:31.320> hot<00:02:31.530> glue<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.780> put<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
sealed get some more hot glue and put it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
sealed get some more hot glue and put it
right<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:36.570> right<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.650> next<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:44.450> put

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
right to the right of the next one put

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.400 
right to the right of the next one put
it<00:02:47.300> not<00:02:48.350> completely<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.360> edge<00:02:51.960> because

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
it not completely on the edge because

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.960 
it not completely on the edge because
when<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:52.830> close<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.640> don't<00:02:53.730> want<00:02:53.910> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
when you close this up you don't want to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.370 
when you close this up you don't want to
see<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> other<00:02:54.390> pieces<00:02:54.810> hanging<00:02:54.990> out<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
see the other pieces hanging out and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.050 
see the other pieces hanging out and
then<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> make<00:02:56.520> sure<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.850> these

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
then you want to make sure that these

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.680 
then you want to make sure that these
two<00:02:57.120> pieces<00:02:57.600> are<00:02:57.900> right<00:02:58.230> next<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> each<00:02:58.740> other

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
two pieces are right next to each other

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.240 
two pieces are right next to each other
