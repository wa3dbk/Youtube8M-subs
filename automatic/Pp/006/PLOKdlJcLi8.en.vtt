00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
of technical terms we're going to go

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.600 
of technical terms we're going to go
through<00:00:32.940> all<00:00:33.480> sorts<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.470> stuff<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.890> we're

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
going to go over the optics and learn

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
going to go over the optics and learn
how<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.030> why<00:00:39.210> depth<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.720> field<00:00:39.960> works<00:00:40.290> really

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
how and why depth of field works really

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
how and why depth of field works really
cool<00:00:41.219> stuff<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.329> any<00:00:42.450> event<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> use

cool stuff but in any event going to use
the<00:00:43.110> 40d<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.730> demonstration

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the 40d for this little demonstration

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.939 
the 40d for this little demonstration
and<00:00:45.480> basically<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.469> i<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> show<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
and basically what i want to show you

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.029 
and basically what i want to show you
was<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.520> got<00:00:47.640> AV<00:00:48.000> mode<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.110> camera<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
was we got AV mode on this camera and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.380 
was we got AV mode on this camera and
that<00:00:50.129> stands<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.430> aperture<00:00:50.670> priority<00:00:51.149> mode

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that stands for aperture priority mode

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.260 
that stands for aperture priority mode
every<00:00:52.260> camera<00:00:52.620> has<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.340> nikon

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
every camera has it pretty much nikon

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
every camera has it pretty much nikon
whatever<00:00:54.739> some<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.890> might<00:00:55.980> use<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
whatever some of them might use a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.619 
whatever some of them might use a
different<00:00:56.489> letter<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.149> basically<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
different letter but it's basically a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.400 
different letter but it's basically a
AAA<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.350> AV<00:00:58.710> usually<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.570> then<00:01:00.570> once<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> have

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
AAA or AV usually and then once you have

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.259 
AAA or AV usually and then once you have
it<00:01:01.530> set<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.160> mode<00:01:02.460> pretty<00:01:02.879> much<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
it set in that mode pretty much all you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.600 
it set in that mode pretty much all you
got<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> turn<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.710> dial<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.129> your

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
got to do is turn this dial here your

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.040 
got to do is turn this dial here your
finger<00:01:05.940> and<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> adjust<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:06.929> aperture

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
finger and you can adjust the aperture

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.560 
finger and you can adjust the aperture
that<00:01:07.410> quick<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.640> makes<00:01:09.149> it<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.420> easy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that quick and it makes it really easy

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.820 
that quick and it makes it really easy
for<00:01:09.869> wedding<00:01:10.289> type<00:01:10.500> work<00:01:10.940> on<00:01:11.940> location

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
for wedding type work on location

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.780 
for wedding type work on location
portraiture<00:01:13.830> stuff<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
portraiture stuff which we do all the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.969 
portraiture stuff which we do all the
time<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> i<00:01:16.140> always<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.740> aperture

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
time and i always have it in aperture

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
time and i always have it in aperture
priority<00:01:17.130> mode<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.119> much<00:01:18.150> easier

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
priority mode it's just so much easier

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.030 
priority mode it's just so much easier
and<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> worry<00:01:19.920> about

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and it you don't have to worry about

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
and it you don't have to worry about
constantly<00:01:20.700> checking<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> shutter<00:01:21.330> i<00:01:21.570> mean

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
constantly checking the shutter i mean

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.300 
constantly checking the shutter i mean
if<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.110> having<00:01:22.259> light<00:01:22.530> set<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.100> stuff

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
if you're having light set up and stuff

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
if you're having light set up and stuff
obviously<00:01:23.580> manual<00:01:24.450> mode<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> better

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
obviously manual mode would be a better

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
obviously manual mode would be a better
way<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.579> have<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> set<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
way to go or if you have time to set the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.999 
way to go or if you have time to set the
tripod<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.869> things<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.200> manual

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
tripod up and things like that manual

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
tripod up and things like that manual
mode<00:01:29.130> might<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> better<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.570> in

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
mode might be a better way to go but in

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
mode might be a better way to go but in
this<00:01:30.869> case<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> type<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this case you know for the type of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
this case you know for the type of
shooting<00:01:33.810> ideally<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.829> aperture<00:01:35.520> priority

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
shooting ideally it's aperture priority

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
shooting ideally it's aperture priority
seems<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> best<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.560> far<00:01:37.740> as

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
seems to be the best way to go as far as

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.889 
seems to be the best way to go as far as
you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.280> ease<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.240> getting<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.600> shots

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
you know ease and getting more shots

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.399 
you know ease and getting more shots
than<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.399> manual<00:01:41.850> mode<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:43.049> recommend

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
than you know manual mode so i recommend

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
than you know manual mode so i recommend
using<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.369> photo<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.390> auto<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
using that over photo because auto just

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.190 
using that over photo because auto just
sucks<00:01:46.290> don't<00:01:47.220> use<00:01:47.340> auto<00:01:47.549> ever<00:01:47.960> unless<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
sucks don't use auto ever unless you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.420 
sucks don't use auto ever unless you
