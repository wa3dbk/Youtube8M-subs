00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
one of the edge streams or maybe both at

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
one of the edge streams or maybe both at
the<00:01:17.759> same<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the same time we don't know at the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.859 
the same time we don't know at the
moment<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.610> glass<00:01:21.240> sliding<00:01:21.570> feature

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
moment and this glass sliding feature

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.190 
moment and this glass sliding feature
actually<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.650> pretty<00:01:23.210> killer<00:01:24.210> feature<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually is pretty killer feature if you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
ask me so it's said that the s6 edge it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
ask me so it's said that the s6 edge it
will<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.650> panel<00:01:28.979> based<00:01:29.369> system

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
will use the same panel based system

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240 
will use the same panel based system
that<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:30.659> seeing<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.500> Galaxy<00:01:32.220> Note
