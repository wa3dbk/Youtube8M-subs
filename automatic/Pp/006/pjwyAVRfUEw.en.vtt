00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.470
 the cfi that is the study center the 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.910
 anomalous phenomenon in the sky whereby 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.640
 all of us Chileans pay 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740
 taxes so they know if there is a 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.220
 God honor our heaven was created to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.450
 from this first case in arica 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.400
 awesome let's listen and let's 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 able to read the dialogue by subtitle 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.140
 genuine of a pilot and the tower of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.140
 control when you see the following solve 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 but he built 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.169
 some full month 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.829
 everything normal 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 at night because it describes what I can 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.440
 Paris 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 and I probably do not want to fly 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 unidentified 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.070
 with this then we were unsuccessful 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.750
 then it can probably be a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.750
 unidentified flying object 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.030
 see a luminous object that moves like this 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.490
 that you go to the north a speed is 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.460
 slow now accelerated something I did not know what 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.830
 are going to achieve let's say accelerate with the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:04.720
 inertia I call them the north and now 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.720
 it returns to the south it disappeared 63 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 quite the tranquility of which they are 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.660
 the birds because do not notice that I formed 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.940
 what about the color object the notifier 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.410
 his vision by a lot already told me my 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 cousin that soon how is that the great 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.270
 majority skips when you see something happened the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.560
 question calls my attention 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.170
 some time they interviewed many pilots 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.390
 with commercials and they looked normally 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.340
 young and everything as well as I do not have 45 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.750
 I've never been flying for 30 years 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.120
 flying has never seen anything weird 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.860
 everyone agreed that answer because 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.270
 they say from the mouth to the outside 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.950
 I think probably because the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.690
 they put a big starting problem 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.100
 most is like crazy does not bring anything 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.210
 recognize that they have seen that all 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.950
 identified though and talking to 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.290
 people working rebuild parties 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.540
 birthday 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.850
 today is that through and most avoid 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.750
 make a report you look between the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.100
 copilot looks but if I do not have to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.170
 every day sometimes like all three 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.820
 times a year in exchange for a change 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.320
 career very clear but they do not 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.540
 because then you have to do long 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.640
 report paperwork so that it causes its 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.260
 investigation but in general it happens 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.500
 much more often what most 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.500
 think 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.380
 some are bigger 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.300
 we talked about this topic there was one of the year 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.860
 78 one that even landed on a 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.410
 No matter where it is at the aerodrome 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.220
 Tobalaba here we have a field in the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.960
 reality 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.760
 because we have a video that is really 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.440
 we are going to share it with 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:51.260
 you I started this topic and purposely 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:04:00.740
 thanks to the one never seen before with 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:02.540
 photos from the attention from the 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.620
 window of a passenger plane the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.630
 man captures the next image 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.880
 attention we have to be rigorous and 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.680
 cautious with all these images because I already 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.020
 we have explained that the vast majority are 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.310
 false know what I think that friends 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.160
 not one is a classic bubble type 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.530
 frozen between those where after 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.290
 it may be particular however it 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.690
 move then listen to me well this 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.730
 to be able to be described as true 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.260
 because today the most homemade technology 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.780
 allows one to play connected and 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.290
 maintains has to go through rigorous 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.690
 tests where they stop from the contour 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.810
 this image serves the bosom its perfect yes 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.000
 do not 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.100
 are superimposed to see if it is that 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.680
 it has a density a heat without displacement 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.500
 some kind of energy but only that one 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.720
 I'm just going to start talking, not what 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.130
 we know because they are so much for example the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.530
 next video that is quite new 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.410
 I would have to spend approximately months 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.389
 to enter the list of cities 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.650
 analyzed now an eye to awakened to 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.150
 the people who work in those 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.520
 where there are psychologists who enter force 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.250
 already learned to discard those 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:13.040
 who see some minimum and rarity problem 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:15.169
 in the commercial problem pixelation 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.720
 I'm recording with my cell phone or what 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.660
 that went outside and I see that I 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:32.200
 unless he gave me a shout or not least 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:32.200
 with diet is that it does not produce a sound 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:41.850
 then that says it as well as running 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.850
 the imperfect 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.410
 when you are flying 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.810
 when the queen was not so built 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.560
 like a day the root with all the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.560
 precisely 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.410
 what is it that happens that finally 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.940
 we have a legitimate audio the country was 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.220
 complicated was in a relationship 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.080
 policy with the outside where any 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.090
 anomalous object in the sky could 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.650
 mean alicantino painter conflict 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.720
 in Argentina has more attention 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.550
 we have the easiest original audio to 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.260
 you even with subtitles between 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.630
 plane that saw the following and the tower 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.910
 control when it ends they are not going to 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.400
 believe attention 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.650
 be rough 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.919
 in the payroll you are informed we have about 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.180
 everything to look at it after arriving for 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.630
 everyone 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.419
 with that gift of treatment north but 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.630
 I have a notion of thinking 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.350
 song art 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.020
 I have decided for this method 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:54.180
 go ahead please because she now 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:58.610
 is moving south 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.610
 circles do that is this 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.230
 why not 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:19.299
 and now at this moment we are facing 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.730
 you on a small mine 

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:24.100
 iron 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.710
 based on a hill the man sees that 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.940
 this unidentified flying object does 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.530
 a series of pirouettes that man 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.780
 clearly in full light it was a UFO or 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.940
 subtracted from the clear height horde and 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.840
 he sees it even perch on a hill 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.490
 there 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.130
 love for the north and then for the 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.390
 circle exactly do not say it with 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.550
 movements that land machines 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.720
 they can not do it is tremendously 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.720
 interesting the subject talk
