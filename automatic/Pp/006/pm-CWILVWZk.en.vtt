they did a ghost event a couple months

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.460 
they did a ghost event a couple months
back<00:00:23.760> they<00:00:24.029> invited<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:24.600> youtubers<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:25.230> and

back they invited some youtubers out and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.929 
back they invited some youtubers out and
we<00:00:25.529> were<00:00:25.560> able<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.949> play<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> game<00:00:26.609> early<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
we were able to play the game early and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.560 
we were able to play the game early and
I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.330> played<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.900> ps4<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.820> PC

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
I think we played it on like ps4 and PC

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
I think we played it on like ps4 and PC
at<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.260> different<00:00:31.679> time<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.430> gameplay

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
at a different time so the gameplay

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.130 
at a different time so the gameplay
might<00:00:32.910> even<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.360> little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.690> different

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
might even look a little bit different

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.720 
might even look a little bit different
but<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.710> should<00:00:34.860> enjoy<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.579> like

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
but you should enjoy it it's not like

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.010 
but you should enjoy it it's not like

so many people are so superstitious

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.240 
so many people are so superstitious
about<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.000> number<00:01:12.210> 13<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.530> having<00:01:14.070> bad<00:01:14.220> luck

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
about the number 13 and having bad luck

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.710 
about the number 13 and having bad luck
around<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.210> won't<00:01:15.299> even<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.630> able

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
around it that they won't even be able

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
around it that they won't even be able
to<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.140> floor<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.770> thought<00:01:17.189> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to go to that floor so I thought this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
to go to that floor so I thought this
was<00:01:17.490> totally<00:01:17.670> fitting<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> talk<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.600> bad

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
was totally fitting to talk about bad

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.100 
was totally fitting to talk about bad
luck<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.439> win<00:01:19.890> bad<00:01:20.130> luck<00:01:20.430> strikes<00:01:21.080> now<00:01:22.080> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
luck and win bad luck strikes now I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
luck and win bad luck strikes now I
wouldn't<00:01:22.470> consider<00:01:22.680> myself<00:01:22.950> an<00:01:23.400> uptight

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
