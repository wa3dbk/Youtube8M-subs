like Nick can may be able to make the
one<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> corner<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.000> don't<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
one down the corner I don't know if the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.460 
one down the corner I don't know if the
eights<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> way<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.350> it's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
eights and the way or not but if it's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
eights and the way or not but if it's
not<00:01:28.710> he'll<00:01:29.490> probably<00:01:29.640> elect<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> play<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
not he'll probably elect to play a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.960 
not he'll probably elect to play a
safety<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> four<00:01:31.829> ball<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> race<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
safety so the four ball was a race so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
safety so the four ball was a race so
that's<00:01:33.479> why<00:01:33.720> he<00:01:33.869> continues<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.380> shoot<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:35.100> go

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that's why he continues to shoot they go

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
that's why he continues to shoot they go

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
for the seven ball it's got a great

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.330 
for the seven ball it's got a great
stroke<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> knowledge<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> game

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
stroke and it is a knowledge of the game

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:26.360 
stroke and it is a knowledge of the game
of<00:03:16.610> pocket<00:03:17.480> player<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.959> enormous

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.530 

it's<00:03:27.370> having<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> little<00:03:27.760> problem<00:03:28.180> getting<00:03:28.210> in

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it's having a little problem getting in

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.730 
it's having a little problem getting in
line<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.930> seems<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.230> he<00:03:29.319> wanted<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.650> be

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
line it seems like he wanted to be

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.870 
line it seems like he wanted to be
straight<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> eighth<00:03:30.520> he's<00:03:30.730> got<00:03:30.850> a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
straight in on the eighth he's got a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.770 
straight in on the eighth he's got a
little<00:03:31.090> angle<00:03:31.390> on<00:03:31.480> it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
little angle on it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.420 
little angle on it
so<00:03:32.080> probably<00:03:32.709> hold<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.069> up<00:03:33.160> with<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> little

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
so probably hold it up with a little

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.400 
so probably hold it up with a little
