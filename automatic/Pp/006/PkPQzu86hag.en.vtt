 loading and so on go further 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.260
 if in the laptop close don't watch it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.010

 You can do well with the English principle 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.530
 English does not matter 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.890
 the first let's 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.040
 monitoring and looking for the value that you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.079
 should be such as to expose the frame rate 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.770
 you must check it here 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.970
