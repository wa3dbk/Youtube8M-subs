into overdrive um it seems like we're

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
into overdrive um it seems like we're
going<00:02:10.379> number<00:02:11.069> two<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:11.700> giving

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
going number two it's actually giving

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.030 
going number two it's actually giving
away<00:02:12.330> some<00:02:12.599> story<00:02:12.930> plots<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.560> were

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
away some story plots that were

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.720 
away some story plots that were
actually<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.209> go<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.739> new<00:02:16.980> place<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
actually going to go to a new place of

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.599 
actually going to go to a new place of
skylands<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.480> no<00:02:18.629> one<00:02:18.780> has<00:02:18.930> seen<00:02:19.230> before<00:02:19.709> so

maybe<00:02:41.010> they're<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.700> comics<00:02:42.060> doing<00:02:42.299> it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
maybe they're just the comics doing it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.520 
maybe they're just the comics doing it
but<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.599> bet<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.900> they're<00:02:43.049> gonna<00:02:43.139> allow<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
but I bet you they're gonna allow it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.089 
but I bet you they're gonna allow it
like<00:02:43.889> I<00:02:44.010> thought<00:02:44.250> fifth<00:02:44.519> game<00:02:45.349> now<00:02:46.349> these<00:02:46.920> are

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
like I thought fifth game now these are

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.750 
like I thought fifth game now these are
some<00:02:47.310> things<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.790> dislike<00:02:48.590> for<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.370> some

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
some things that I dislike for and some

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.149 
some things that I dislike for and some
are<00:02:50.879> just<00:02:50.909> knit<00:02:51.239> picks<00:02:51.480> oh<00:02:51.829> no<00:02:52.829> no<00:02:53.129> no<00:02:58.159> okay

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
are just knit picks oh no no no okay

are just knit picks oh no no no okay
these<00:02:59.549> are<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.849> some<00:03:00.030> dick<00:03:00.239> pics<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.769> um

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
these are just some dick pics for one um

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.800 
these are just some dick pics for one um
this<00:03:04.859> may<00:03:05.159> mean<00:03:05.430> traps<00:03:06.120> aren't<00:03:06.389> compatible

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
this may mean traps aren't compatible

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.970 
this may mean traps aren't compatible
because<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.560> said<00:03:07.889> chaos<00:03:08.579> returns<00:03:09.980> something

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
because it said chaos returns something

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.280 
because it said chaos returns something
that<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> don't<00:03:11.639> I<00:03:11.879> didn't<00:03:12.510> really<00:03:12.629> want<00:03:13.019> Cass

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
that I don't I didn't really want Cass

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.679 
that I don't I didn't really want Cass
to<00:03:13.650> return<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.459> wanted<00:03:14.760> him<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.329> trap

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
to return I just wanted him in the trap

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.000 
to return I just wanted him in the trap
I<00:03:16.049> wanted<00:03:16.680> him<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:17.069> think<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.459> are<00:03:17.609> kind<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.209> like

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
I wanted him I think we are kind of like

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.619 
I wanted him I think we are kind of like
we've<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.220> chaos<00:03:20.609> for<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.000> long<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.599> thought

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
we've got chaos for so long I thought

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.930 
we've got chaos for so long I thought
it's<00:03:21.959> time<00:03:22.199> for<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> new<00:03:22.500> villain<00:03:22.889> but<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.609> think

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
it's time for a new villain but I think

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.819 
it's time for a new villain but I think
that<00:03:24.120> they<00:03:24.359> could<00:03:24.419> have<00:03:24.569> been<00:03:24.750> planted<00:03:25.169> like

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
that they could have been planted like

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.640 
that they could have been planted like
put<00:03:26.069> chaos<00:03:26.430> into<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.790> story<00:03:27.299> somehow<00:03:27.780> like

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
put chaos into the story somehow like

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.729 
put chaos into the story somehow like
maybe<00:03:28.889> he's<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.129> good<00:03:29.370> guy<00:03:29.579> now<00:03:29.959> um<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.190> yeah<00:03:33.739> um

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
maybe he's a good guy now um so yeah um

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.520 
maybe he's a good guy now um so yeah um
another<00:03:35.250> thing<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.659> like<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.470> uh<00:03:39.530> if
