00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
video editor and it's not an easy

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.799 
video editor and it's not an easy
changeover<00:00:11.700> for<00:00:11.880> me<00:00:12.030> I've<00:00:12.450> been<00:00:12.630> using

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
changeover for me I've been using

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.140 
changeover for me I've been using
Windows<00:00:13.200> Movie<00:00:13.230> Maker<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.980> five<00:00:14.250> years<00:00:14.790> and

Windows Movie Maker for five years and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.849 
Windows Movie Maker for five years and
it<00:00:15.240> turns<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.839> nothing<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> real

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
it turns out it's nothing like a real

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.250 
it turns out it's nothing like a real
video<00:00:17.220> editor<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.150> my<00:00:18.300> frustration<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
video editor so my frustration with it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.870 
video editor so my frustration with it
made<00:00:19.529> me<00:00:19.650> miss<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.859> few<00:00:20.100> things<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> video

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
look pretty but I did notice some

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689 
look pretty but I did notice some
graphical<00:00:52.469> pop<00:00:52.710> ends<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
graphical pop ends when I was on the

main hub I should be able to see what
attraction<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> halfway<00:00:56.760> across<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.300> world

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
attraction is halfway across the world

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.200 
attraction is halfway across the world
however<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.410> can't<00:00:58.770> it'll<00:00:59.579> pop<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
however you can't it'll pop in the

however you can't it'll pop in the
screen<00:01:00.510> whenever<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.079> close<00:01:01.140> enough<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
screen whenever you get close enough and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
screen whenever you get close enough and
that<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.430> odd<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.239> next-gen<00:01:03.809> launch

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that was odd to see in a next-gen launch

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
that was odd to see in a next-gen launch
game<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> controls<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> games<00:01:05.939> were

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
game now the controls of the games were

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
game now the controls of the games were
very<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> did<00:01:07.380> run<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:07.740> some<00:01:07.860> issues

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
very good I did run into some issues

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
very good I did run into some issues
when<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.640> playing<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> Metroid<00:01:09.510> flying

when I was playing the Metroid flying
game<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> bit<00:01:10.920> confusing<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> play<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820

game it was a bit confusing to play in
control<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:12.930> gonna<00:01:13.049> Chuck<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
control but I think I'm gonna Chuck that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.679 
control but I think I'm gonna Chuck that
one<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.950> me<00:01:14.100> being<00:01:14.340> lousy<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:15.000> flying<00:01:15.330> games

I<00:02:27.480> think<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.170> Yoshi<00:02:28.379> game<00:02:28.680> where<00:02:28.859> you<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
I think the Yoshi game where you have to

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.099 
I think the Yoshi game where you have to
draw<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.310> way<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.670> she<00:02:29.909> travels<00:02:30.450> by<00:02:30.900> using

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
draw the way that she travels by using

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.259 
draw the way that she travels by using
the<00:02:31.290> gamepad<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.859> draw<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.159> path<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.879> not<00:02:33.120> be

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
the gamepad to draw the path and not be

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.520 
the gamepad to draw the path and not be
able<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.569> see<00:02:33.719> what<00:02:33.840> you're<00:02:33.989> drawing<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.439> the

able to see what you're drawing on the
TV<00:02:34.859> was<00:02:35.069> very<00:02:35.280> clever
