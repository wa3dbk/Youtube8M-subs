00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.309 
a great deepwater jig again a fairly
standard<00:02:03.639> design<00:02:04.329> in<00:02:04.600> terms<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.959> the<00:02:05.020> way<00:02:05.170> it's

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
standard design in terms of the way it's

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.679 
standard design in terms of the way it's
weighted<00:02:05.740> it's<00:02:06.249> an<00:02:06.399> upgrade<00:02:06.850> again<00:02:07.389> with<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
weighted it's an upgrade again with the

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.540 
weighted it's an upgrade again with the
welded<00:02:08.080> ring<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> nose<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:09.399> know<00:02:09.459> and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
welded ring on the nose you know and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.940 
welded ring on the nose you know and
then<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:09.940> go<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.179> split<00:02:10.479> ring<00:02:10.709> through<00:02:11.709> wired

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
then we go to a split ring through wired

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.699 
then we go to a split ring through wired
of<00:02:12.160> course<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:12.819> these<00:02:13.000> jigs<00:02:13.500> next<00:02:14.500> piece

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
of course like all these jigs next piece

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.760 
of course like all these jigs next piece
is<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.670> call<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.270> wedge<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.530> wedge

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
is what we call the wedge and the wedge

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.400 
is what we call the wedge and the wedge
is<00:02:18.190> basically<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.060> design

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
is basically a design

were only available in a couple
different<00:02:34.990> sizes<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.800> now<00:02:35.890> we've<00:02:36.070> beefed

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
different sizes and now we've beefed

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.000 
different sizes and now we've beefed
these<00:02:36.610> up<00:02:36.850> considerably<00:02:37.570> now<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.650> we're<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
these up considerably now so we're in a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.730 
these up considerably now so we're in a
300<00:02:39.520> gram<00:02:39.760> level<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.410> number<00:02:41.650> of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
300 gram level so the number of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.380 
300 gram level so the number of
different<00:02:42.010> sizes<00:02:42.190> check<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.790> website<00:02:42.940> but

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
a little differently these guys no doubt

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.189 
a little differently these guys no doubt
you<00:05:02.180> know<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.330> little<00:05:02.539> bit<00:05:02.660> different<00:05:02.990> too<00:05:03.110> in

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
you know a little bit different too in

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.659 
you know a little bit different too in
the<00:05:03.289> way<00:05:03.380> we<00:05:03.530> have<00:05:03.710> these<00:05:03.860> rigged<00:05:04.160> up<00:05:04.310> yeah

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
the way we have these rigged up yeah

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.070 
the way we have these rigged up yeah
versus<00:05:05.060> other<00:05:05.180> things<00:05:05.449> in<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.630> marketplace

versus other things in the marketplace

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.020 
versus other things in the marketplace
but<00:05:06.229> we<00:05:06.320> think<00:05:06.500> he'll<00:05:06.620> get<00:05:06.800> bit<00:05:07.520> quite<00:05:07.760> well

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
but we think he'll get bit quite well

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.490 
but we think he'll get bit quite well
with<00:05:08.150> them<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:09.020> see<00:05:09.169> there's<00:05:09.350> a<00:05:09.380> little

with them and I can see there's a little

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.370 
with them and I can see there's a little
chafing<00:05:09.949> spring<00:05:10.280> on<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.150> assists<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:12.199> know
