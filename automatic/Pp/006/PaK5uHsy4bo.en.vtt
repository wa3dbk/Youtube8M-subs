00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 it proves everything in anything that comes to mind 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.070
 what is he trying 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.120
 always try to get to 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.119
 to throw it to the maximum limit of 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.649
 Give him squeezing in the car in time per lap not 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.060
 and in that case in particular because fernando realized 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.460
 25 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.029
 it was forced with a baltasar truck to change brands 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 while the accelerator pedal by thoroughly 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 of the bush did not come out 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.619
 but the moment that came to the imitator, the stain came out alone, with which it was 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:31.479
 Changing 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.479
 zarrías has changed gears at the right time 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 percent 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.580
 the anecdote is that he realized all year long he was doing 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.420
 but that can be done in any spot except for the 4th 5th complacent 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.470
 It broke 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.210
 when the voice started to run 3 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.220
 Teresa Montero many tapes 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.860
 at the end of a time nobody else pilots who tried to do it after 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.040
 they broke the fifth and 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.410
 many did not know why and was borghi tried to do the same as fernando 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.950
 vázquez fernando arronte once and never again not one of the good things 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.170
 that fernando stumbles once known in advance 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.300
 never stumble twice 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.520
 in that 1999 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.770
 Alonso took out his driving license 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 although they were ap 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.890
 point to suspend him for going too slow 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.320
 in the nissan got six victories 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.320
 the last one was used to win the championship 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.410
 fernando had a remote possibility of snatching the title to Portuguese 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.710
 Manuel Giao 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 in the first round he was second with what he had to win the second and mark the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 fast turn 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.290
 And he did 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 there are bars 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.320
 the least call scratching at a great level 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.060
 the honor of movistar restart of the 1999 season 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.470
 with the good way 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.680
 molina 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 2nd race joy among the members of the Balearic team 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.250
 the arsenal 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 as he did last year with mariachi so 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.590
 we have a high dollar number of Spanish 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.540
 the man green lantern 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.990
 in January the movistar to imitate the new champion is called Fernando Alonso 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.459
 then dollars 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.969
 the federal government intends to approve a formula 1 in November 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.420
 but also in the first year in Peruvian tip 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.519
 it was not a long career 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.579
 we wanted to win the individual title the team or 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.659
 fernando step to the formula 3000 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.469
 in his first year he was already able to win a race and prove his quality 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.900
 the Asturian showed an ability to adapt to the new categories 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.669
 unfit for a kid of his age 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.619
 I had also tried a formula 1 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.619
 was closer to his dream of being at the top 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.509
 when I knew that I was going to turn a formula 1 that was in sherry 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.650
 because your union I remember perfectly that to decide who made me illusion and 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.619
 reality 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.119
 it went well I was surprised 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.419
 because normally a person when they let you try a car 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.859
 slow down you go carefully I do not know what we would do instead 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.019
 I remember that I saw him leave 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.159
 on the goal line conan on one side one skidding and really I 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.539
 surprised 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.539
 and already in taxes without having tried practically never made good ones 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.049
 time 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.199
 several teams of Formula 1 were fixed on him 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.919
 and it was renault who convinced him and designed for Alonso the way to the 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:29.939
 success 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.549
 in 2001 he was transferred to minardi where he made his debut in the premier category of 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.949
 motoring 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.269
 was on March 4 at the albert park circuit 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.189
 in Melbourne at the Grand Prix of Australia 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.639
 at only 19 years old he became the third youngest driver in history 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.819
 of formula 1 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.959
 it was not an easy year for a fernando 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.039
 if he was used to winning 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.809
 he watched with impotence how his piloting skills were not enough to achieve 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.019
 good results at the controls of a little competitive car 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.539
 embodying 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.479
 there were many new things from 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.899
 See you 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:11.899
 the conviction that 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.909
 a confidence in himself that he 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.139
 Chávez expressed 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.799
 It's scary 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.199
 and then he has 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.139
 a great talent 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.139
 above all, this agent has a natural quality 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.930
 I know that things will be around the room very easily 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.139
 that the people who work 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.139
 but it is partly to the chest by the cut 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.340
 easy racing 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.550
 every time he goes out on the track 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.529
 that makes people who have 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.729
 be delighted 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.729
 they can be all the hours that are needed working 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.759
 in renault did not miss the great season of alonso 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.439
 they decided to refresh them to become their test pilot 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.249
 It was perhaps the worst year for the Asturian 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.029
 although his work was rewarded when the following season 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.139
 became the official driver of the French team 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.389
 it was the great bet of flavio briatore petras denis marked and adrián fields 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.890
 had seen in alonso a young man full of talent had everything to become 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.499
 in the best 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.580
 to achieve it fernando moved to live of sports in the united kingdom 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.580
 where renault has its operations center 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.680
 Alonso only needed two races to go back into history 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.990
 in March 2003 at the malaysia fernando grand prix he achieved the best time 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.029
 in the official trainings 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.929
 he thus became the youngest driver in history to achieve a 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:44.860
 pole 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.529
 But that was not all 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.379
 in the race he crossed the finish line in third place which made him the first 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.349
 Spanish driver who climbed the podium solo 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.729
 and also in the youngest driver in history to get a podium 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.479
 he was only 21 years and eight months 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.400
 but the moment of glory for Fernando Alonso arrived on August 24, 2003 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.439
 in the hungaroring circuit 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.499
 where he won his first grand prize 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.169
 has already reached the yeah yeah dodging 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.610
 the straight the circuit was founded rim asked to bilbao course within about 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.599
 years where fernando alonso won his first race occupying the penultimate 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:28.180
 curve 13th test of the 2003 season last satisfaction curve 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.490
 Spanish television to be able to offer you this moment was all 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.880
 In motorsports and in Spanish sports, Fernando Alonso has valued 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.979
 the finger and added that they were not flying left a braking to Utah health and 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.360
 It will also give course to swim having paid a trip to Bavaria Formula 1 for 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.490
 the first time in history the Spaniard has won a grand prize of formula 1 and 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.849
 he also becomes the youngest driver in history 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.419
 of formula 1 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.779
 the race 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:57.199
 it gives a little 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.199
 the confirmation of 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.939
 after confirmation 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:05.930
 was to enter 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.099
 in what I 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.099
 I've been saying for some time now that 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:14.680
 which will be the legend fernando monzón on the other 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.169
 at first 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.009
 I remember that 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.399
 flavio arrived 

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:22.110
 his parents ecology can not strain nor 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.110
 or entities that I was with 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.559
 until I could hug him 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:33.489
 the euro zone
