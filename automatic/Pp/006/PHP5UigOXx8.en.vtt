samsung's 2015 flagship the galaxy s6

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.420 
samsung's 2015 flagship the galaxy s6
was<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> huge<00:00:04.110> step<00:00:04.470> forward<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.040> company

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
was a huge step forward for the company

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.789 
was a huge step forward for the company
in<00:00:05.609> many<00:00:05.910> ways<00:00:06.230> but<00:00:07.230> just<00:00:07.410> like<00:00:07.500> every<00:00:07.770> other

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
in many ways but just like every other

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.820 
in many ways but just like every other
phone<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.490> s6<00:00:09.000> isn't<00:00:09.450> perfect<00:00:09.870> should<00:00:10.710> you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
phone the s6 isn't perfect should you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.890 
phone the s6 isn't perfect should you
buy<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.070> I'm<00:00:11.400> been<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.330> try<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
buy it I'm been with that I try it and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.120 
buy it I'm been with that I try it and
these<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.170> three<00:00:13.410> reasons<00:00:13.710> why<00:00:14.070> you

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
these are three reasons why you

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:25.970 
these are three reasons why you
shouldn't<00:00:14.639> buy<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> galaxy<00:00:15.660> s6<00:00:24.740> first<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> all

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
shouldn't buy the galaxy s6 first of all

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.160 
shouldn't buy the galaxy s6 first of all
let's<00:00:26.279> talk<00:00:26.369> about<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> software<00:00:27.510> now<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
let's talk about the software now the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
let's talk about the software now the
software<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.769> s6<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> still<00:00:29.699> miles<00:00:30.119> ahead

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
software in the s6 is still miles ahead

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
software in the s6 is still miles ahead
of<00:00:30.630> Samsung's<00:00:31.410> previous<00:00:31.920> software

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
of Samsung's previous software

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.940 
of Samsung's previous software
iterations<00:00:32.930> but<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.140> still<00:00:34.410> has<00:00:34.559> plenty<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
iterations but it still has plenty of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
iterations but it still has plenty of
bloatware<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.670> board<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.809> has<00:00:37.020> its

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
bloatware on board and it has its

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
bloatware on board and it has its
moments<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.710> lag<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.910> also<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
moments of lag but it's also the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
moments of lag but it's also the
software<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> simply<00:00:40.379> feels<00:00:40.620> disorganized

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
software that simply feels disorganized

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
software that simply feels disorganized
and<00:00:41.610> repetitive<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.510> times<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.649> not

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and repetitive at times it's not

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
and repetitive at times it's not
completely<00:00:44.309> horrible<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> software<00:00:46.170> on

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
completely horrible but the software on

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.619 
completely horrible but the software on
the<00:00:46.440> galaxy<00:00:46.829> s6<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> main<00:00:48.180> reasons

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the galaxy s6 is one of the main reasons

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.439 
the galaxy s6 is one of the main reasons

on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> back<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.809> good<00:00:58.039> but<00:00:59.039> instead<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
on the back which is good but instead of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.130 
on the back which is good but instead of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
fairly loud audio they are still very

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
fairly loud audio they are still very
easy<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> cover<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.080> while<00:01:13.320> using<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.799> device

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
easy to cover up while using the device

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
easy to cover up while using the device
now<00:01:15.030> last<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.689> probably<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.080> number<00:01:16.439> one

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
now last and probably the number one

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.760 
now last and probably the number one
reason<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.490> battery<00:01:17.880> life<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:19.080> s6<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
reason is the battery life the s6 has a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710 
reason is the battery life the s6 has a
smaller<00:01:20.189> than<00:01:20.369> average<00:01:20.549> battery<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
smaller than average battery and as you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.899 
smaller than average battery and as you
would<00:01:21.840> expect<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.500> does<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.009> hold<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
would expect it does not hold up to the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.179 
would expect it does not hold up to the
competition<00:01:24.409> while<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.920> added
