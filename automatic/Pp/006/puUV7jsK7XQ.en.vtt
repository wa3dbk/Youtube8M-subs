00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
too but those trees were so ridiculous I

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.520 
too but those trees were so ridiculous I
think<00:04:44.920> they<00:04:45.100> were<00:04:45.160> supposed<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.760> be<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> bush

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530

they<00:04:47.530> got<00:04:47.710> very<00:04:47.980> very<00:04:48.370> out<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.640> hand<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.240> then

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
they got very very out of hand and then

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.140 
they got very very out of hand and then
became<00:04:49.870> trees<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:51.340> because<00:04:51.550> people<00:04:51.760> stopped

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
became trees just because people stopped

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.040 
became trees just because people stopped
like<00:04:52.830> taking<00:04:53.830> care<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.070> them<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.780> roots

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
like taking care of them and the roots

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.990

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
and other things but I clean that up a

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.030 
and other things but I clean that up a
little<00:05:16.000> bit<00:05:16.180> I<00:05:16.390> tied<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.690> string<00:05:16.990> which<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.920> why

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
little bit I tied a string which is why

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.980 
little bit I tied a string which is why
the<00:05:18.100> dogs<00:05:18.430> had<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.850> string<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:19.330> tied<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.900> string

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
the dogs had the string I tied a string

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.350 
the dogs had the string I tied a string
around<00:05:20.230> those<00:05:20.620> tall<00:05:20.890> ones<00:05:21.130> so<00:05:21.910> that<00:05:22.150> looks

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
around those tall ones so that looks

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.210 
around those tall ones so that looks
much<00:05:22.540> nicer<00:05:22.750> now<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.650> then<00:05:23.770> I<00:05:23.800> just<00:05:23.950> kind<00:05:24.130> of

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
much nicer now and then I just kind of

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.580 
much nicer now and then I just kind of
went<00:05:24.370> along<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.820> edges<00:05:25.830> definitely<00:05:27.360> not<00:05:28.590> done

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
went along the edges definitely not done

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.590 
went along the edges definitely not done
to<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.220> point<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.670> like<00:05:30.880> this<00:05:31.120> looks<00:05:31.390> great

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
to the point of like this looks great

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.200 
to the point of like this looks great
but<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.770> looks<00:05:33.070> much<00:05:33.910> better

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.139 

where<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.449> boy<00:05:38.689> is
