00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone! I hope everyone was not scared by the puppet makeup last week. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.400
 Keep my Halloween makeup, this time I will turn myself into this sexy FAFINETTE. 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.040
 They are the masterpieces of the French painter FAFI. 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.820
 I really like their flattery. 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.100
 Similarly, this makeup can be painted with normal cosmetics. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 Ready? 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.560
 I put on the pupil enlargement first, and I wore the angel brown of GEO. 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 I want the skin to be particularly shiny. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 Mix liquid highlights with liquid foundation in a ratio of 1:1 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.700
 Use a foundation brush to evenly distribute the product. 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720
 Cover any cockroach 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.520
 This makeup requires ceramic skin. 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.260
 Use concealer to set the concealer and foundation 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.140
 Brush the excess powder away in a circle 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.900
 This time, the eyebrows should be lighter, so as not to steal the focus. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.900
 Fill the eyebrows with a lighter color 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.700
 Shape can be determined by yourself 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 Draw a little lighter eyebrows 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.480
 First brush the eyebrow cream against the growth direction 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.040
 Make sure that each hair is dyed and then brushed along the growth direction 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.940
 Turn your eyes, apply a few layers of pearl eyeshadow to create a bright eye look 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.900
 Fill the entire eye socket until the eye socket is recessed 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.600
 Apply the same eye shadow to the inner corner of the eye 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.520
 In order to avoid the makeup, we first clamp the eyelashes. 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.880
 This time I used black eyeliner 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.720
 Squinting, draw a line parallel to the lower eyeliner from the end of the eye 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 To achieve the effect of crazy cat eyes 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.140
 Connect the eyeliner to 1/3 of the upper eyeliner and fill the frame 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.860
 You can extend your eyeliner according to your hobbies. 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.340
 Make sure the lines are straight. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.560
 The cat's eye will be more noticeable when the inner corner of the eye is gently drawn down. 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.060
 Next, fill the inner eyeliner with a white eyeliner 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.300
 The makeup will be more like a doll, don't miss the inner corner! 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.000
 Then draw the black eyeliner under the white eyeliner and frame the eyes. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.180
 Try to keep the lines thin and connect to the upper eyeliner 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.580
 Emphasizing the inner corner of the eye to complete the cat's eye 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.900
 Want to have a softer line, you can apply matte brown eyeshadow on the lower eye line. 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.800
 Don't panic if something goes wrong! It can be easily modified with concealer! 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.900
 You can apply a layer of mascara to position the eyelashes before wearing false eyelashes. 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.300
 If there is any glue that is exposed, use a black eyeliner to cover it. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
 Cheeks are the focus of this makeup 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.420
 Use your lipstick to draw a heart shape on the apple muscle 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 You can increase it when you fill it up, as you like 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.660
 If you are worried that the lipstick will be spent, you can take a layer of honey powder to fix your makeup. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.060
 Use concealer to cover the shape of your lips. 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
 Want to draw a new lip more accurately 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
 You can use the eyeliner brush to get the lip color you want. 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.540
 Draw a V at the lip peak position 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.060
 Slowly draw the lip into a round shape 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.700
 Slowly draw from the center, slowly expand the scope 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.740
 Apply a little more lipstick after the shape is determined. 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.440
 Finally, using concealer to highlight the lip shape 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.560
 This is done! 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.740
 This makeup is crazy enough for Halloween, but it is cute. 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.680
 Perfect for those sisters who want to look beautiful and cute. 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.720
 FAFINETTE has beautiful cat eyes 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.980
 Heart-shaped blush 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.640
 There are round lips 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.940
 This is my interpretation of them using everyday cosmetics! 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.260
 Now you just need to wear fun clothes and accessories! 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.360
