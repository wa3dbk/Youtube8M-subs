230<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> actually<00:00:37.739> better<00:00:37.950> than<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> a330s

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
230 is actually better than the a330s

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
230 is actually better than the a330s
with<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> bigger<00:00:39.690> magnification<00:00:40.469> other<00:00:40.950> than

with a bigger magnification other than

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.740 
with a bigger magnification other than
that<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> cameras<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.000> identical<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.660> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that the cameras are identical they have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
that the cameras are identical they have
the<00:00:42.840> same<00:00:43.050> sensor<00:00:43.620> same<00:00:44.250> kit<00:00:44.520> lenses<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.690> they

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the same sensor same kit lenses so they

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
the same sensor same kit lenses so they
produce<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> same<00:00:46.530> image<00:00:46.800> quality<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
produce the same image quality at the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
produce the same image quality at the
same<00:00:47.670> speeds<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> what's<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.469> nice<00:00:49.649> about

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
same speeds and what's really nice about

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.240 
same speeds and what's really nice about
these<00:00:50.219> models<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:51.899> fast<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:53.039> has

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
these models is that they're fast it has

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.569 
these models is that they're fast it has
a<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:54.120> fast<00:00:54.780> autofocus<00:00:55.289> system<00:00:55.770> which

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
a very fast autofocus system which

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
a very fast autofocus system which
really<00:00:56.789> helps<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> slow<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.500> some<00:00:58.710> ways<00:00:58.890> for

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
really helps it is slow in some ways for

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
really helps it is slow in some ways for
instance<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.969> continuous<00:01:00.510> shooting<00:01:00.690> tends

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
instance it's continuous shooting tends

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.850 
instance it's continuous shooting tends
to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.590> pretty<00:01:02.100> slow<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.370> its<00:01:02.699> class<00:01:03.030> but

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
to be this pretty slow for its class but

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
to be this pretty slow for its class but
for<00:01:04.860> single<00:01:05.010> shot<00:01:05.309> shooting<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.180> autofocus

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
for single shot shooting the autofocus

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
for single shot shooting the autofocus
is<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.049> fast<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.189> Live<00:01:08.400> View<00:01:08.430> mode

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is very fast even in Live View mode

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
is very fast even in Live View mode
which<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> rarity<00:01:09.390> Sony<00:01:09.960> made<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.409> changes

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
which is a rarity Sony made some changes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
which is a rarity Sony made some changes
to<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> design<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:11.670> models<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to the design of these models from the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020 
to the design of these models from the
last<00:01:12.630> generation<00:01:13.010> one<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> them<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.850> grip

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
last generation one of them is the grip

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020 
last generation one of them is the grip
is<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:15.380> 3/4<00:01:16.380> height<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.890> didn't<00:01:17.670> find<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
is now 3/4 height I didn't find it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.350 
is now 3/4 height I didn't find it
particularly<00:01:18.390> comfortable<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.640> secure<00:01:20.640> but

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
particularly comfortable or secure but

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
particularly comfortable or secure but
you<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> try<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.380> before<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.799> buy

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you really want to try it before you buy

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
you really want to try it before you buy
on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.850> other<00:01:24.000> hand<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
on the other hand it's got this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
on the other hand it's got this
texturized<00:01:25.920> rubber<00:01:26.220> which<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:27.000> nice

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
texturized rubber which is really nice

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.270 
texturized rubber which is really nice
feeling<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> does<00:01:28.259> add<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.920> security

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
feeling and does add a little security

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.940 
feeling and does add a little security
to<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.729> grip<00:01:30.060> sony<00:01:31.049> also<00:01:31.290> changed<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to your grip sony also changed the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
to your grip sony also changed the
design<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> controls<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> layout<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
design of the controls the layout is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.920 
design of the controls the layout is
different<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> find<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> controls<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
different but I find the controls a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
different but I find the controls a
little<00:01:37.170> flat<00:01:37.530> without<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> lot<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> travel<00:01:38.850> so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
little flat without a lot of travel so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.719 
little flat without a lot of travel so
you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.110> find<00:01:40.710> yourself<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.310> pressing

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you know you find yourself over pressing

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.770 
you know you find yourself over pressing
because<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.299> getting<00:01:42.600> enough

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
because you're not getting enough

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.679 
because you're not getting enough
feedback<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:44.460> also<00:01:44.820> sewn<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> put<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
feedback it also sewn you put the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
feedback it also sewn you put the
exposure<00:01:46.049> compensation<00:01:46.350> button<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> place

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
exposure compensation button in a place

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.859 
exposure compensation button in a place
where<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> shift<00:01:48.659> your

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
back to negative 2 then you may want to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.740 
back to negative 2 then you may want to
