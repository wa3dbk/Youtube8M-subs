off<00:01:57.680> twice<00:01:57.890> once<00:01:58.399> early<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:58.939> once<00:01:59.149> prior<00:01:59.420> to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
off twice once early and once prior to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.109 
off twice once early and once prior to
planting<00:01:59.750> to<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:01.009> work<00:02:01.189> on<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.430> seed<00:02:01.700> bed<00:02:01.909> with

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
planting to to work on a seed bed with

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.639 
planting to to work on a seed bed with
some<00:02:02.299> moisture<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:02.810> planted<00:02:03.140> into<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.590> it

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
some moisture and planted into it and it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.340 
some moisture and planted into it and it
worked<00:02:03.829> perfect<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.609> what<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.780> here<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.170> as

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
worked perfect so what I have here is as

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.020 
worked perfect so what I have here is as
a<00:02:06.439> clumping<00:02:06.859> residue<00:02:07.509> and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
a clumping residue and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.180 
a clumping residue and
you<00:02:10.270> know<00:02:10.390> within<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.899> residue<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.980> pick

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
you know within that residue if you pick

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.270 
you know within that residue if you pick
these<00:02:12.340> clumps<00:02:12.760> up<00:02:12.910> off<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.330> ground<00:02:14.280> you'll

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
these clumps up off the ground you'll

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280 
these clumps up off the ground you'll
find<00:02:15.610> millipedes<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.480> there<00:02:16.690> right<00:02:16.900> now<00:02:17.080> with

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
find millipedes in there right now with

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.949 
find millipedes in there right now with
the<00:02:17.410> cooler<00:02:17.740> weather<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:19.090> there's<00:02:19.780> one

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
the cooler weather there there's one

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.550 
the cooler weather there there's one
right<00:02:20.110> there<00:02:21.870> they're<00:02:22.870> feeding<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.530> that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
right there they're feeding on that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
right there they're feeding on that
decaying<00:02:24.040> wheat<00:02:24.370> straw<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.720> radish<00:02:26.319> residue

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
decaying wheat straw and radish residue

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.940 
decaying wheat straw and radish residue
of<00:02:28.510> course<00:02:28.750> there's<00:02:28.959> no<00:02:29.050> chemical<00:02:29.560> control

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
of course there's no chemical control

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.979 
of course there's no chemical control
for<00:02:30.190> millipedes<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.880> seed<00:02:31.120> treatments<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
for millipedes so seed treatments and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.260 
for millipedes so seed treatments and
the<00:02:32.709> light<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.670> we<00:02:33.760> use<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.090> control

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
the light that that we use to control

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.920 
the light that that we use to control
others<00:02:34.780> seedling<00:02:35.770> pests<00:02:36.270> such<00:02:37.270> as<00:02:37.330> sea<00:02:37.630> corn

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
magnet wire worm etcetera when we use

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.040

insecticides<00:02:44.050> such<00:02:44.500> as<00:02:44.650> force<00:02:44.950> don't<00:02:45.640> work<00:02:45.910> on

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
insecticides such as force don't work on

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.479 
insecticides such as force don't work on
millipedes<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.590> they<00:02:47.830> are<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> bit<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.190> an<00:02:48.340> issue

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
millipedes so they are a bit of an issue

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.490 
millipedes so they are a bit of an issue
for<00:02:48.790> early<00:02:49.060> planning<00:02:49.480> here's<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.019> decaying

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
for early planning here's a decaying

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.229 
for early planning here's a decaying
chunk<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.670> tillage<00:02:52.180> radish<00:02:52.300> here<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:55.060> was

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
chunk of tillage radish here and it was

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.610 
chunk of tillage radish here and it was
actually<00:02:55.420> when<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.780> picked<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.230> was<00:02:56.410> just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
actually when I picked it up was just

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.530 
actually when I picked it up was just
loaded<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.220> millipedes<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:01.030> yeah<00:03:01.209> they're

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
loaded with millipedes so yeah they're

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.120 
loaded with millipedes so yeah they're
they're<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.140> sensing<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.739> decaying

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
they're just sensing that decaying

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.750 
they're just sensing that decaying
residue<00:03:03.610> if<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.819> pry<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.450> open<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:06.550> is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
residue if I pry it open just this is

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.759 
residue if I pry it open just this is
this<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.480> wild<00:03:07.780> stuff<00:03:08.080> right<00:03:08.319> here<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.680> can

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
this is wild stuff right here you can

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.040 
this is wild stuff right here you can
just<00:03:08.860> see<00:03:08.920> piles<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.610> them<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:09.880> there<00:03:10.090> turn

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
just see piles of them in there turn

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.830 
just see piles of them in there turn
that<00:03:11.200> around<00:03:11.380> for<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.920> there<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.450> all<00:03:13.450> life

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that around for you there is all life

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.449 
that around for you there is all life
stages<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.470> millipedes<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.100> there<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.370> there

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
stages of millipedes in there and there

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.160 
stages of millipedes in there and there
has<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.670> be<00:03:15.910> about<00:03:16.180> ten<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:16.630> twelve<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:17.049> them

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
has to be about ten or twelve of them

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.289 
has to be about ten or twelve of them
packed<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.850> piece<00:03:19.120> of

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
packed and not and that piece of

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.990 
packed and not and that piece of
decaying<00:03:19.630> radish<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.519> question<00:03:21.880> really

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
decaying radish so the question really

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
decaying radish so the question really
becomes<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:23.350> know<00:03:23.470> we've<00:03:23.620> heard<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.920> lot<00:03:24.100> in

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
becomes you know we've heard a lot in

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.699 
becomes you know we've heard a lot in
the<00:03:24.340> last<00:03:24.549> in<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.299> last<00:03:25.420> year<00:03:25.810> both<00:03:26.019> frontiers

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the last in the last year both frontiers

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.830 
the last in the last year both frontiers
and<00:03:26.829> corn<00:03:27.190> yield<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:28.150> what<00:03:28.329> are<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.570> next

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and corn yield and what are the next

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.240 
and corn yield and what are the next
frontiers<00:03:29.260> how<00:03:29.470> do<00:03:29.530> we<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.070> next

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
frontiers how do we get to that next

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.210 
frontiers how do we get to that next

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
about early planning need to plant early

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.479 
about early planning need to plant early
to<00:03:55.269> get<00:03:55.390> really<00:03:55.690> top<00:03:55.930> yields<00:03:56.410> how<00:03:57.250> do<00:03:57.310> we

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
to get really top yields how do we

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.280 
to get really top yields how do we
manage<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:58.090> well<00:03:58.359> I<00:03:58.390> mentioned<00:03:58.660> earlier<00:03:59.140> in

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
manage this well I mentioned earlier in

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.190 
manage this well I mentioned earlier in
the<00:03:59.380> video<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:01.570> know<00:04:01.630> if<00:04:01.840> we're<00:04:01.959> going<00:04:02.079> to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
the video you know if we're going to

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.780 
the video you know if we're going to
have<00:04:02.380> lots<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.769> millipedes<00:04:03.280> with<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.549> early

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
have lots of millipedes with the early

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.180 
have lots of millipedes with the early
planning<00:04:04.000> typically<00:04:04.810> April<00:04:05.260> planning<00:04:05.709> we

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
planning typically April planning we

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.920 
planning typically April planning we
have<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.519> deal<00:04:06.730> with<00:04:06.760> some<00:04:07.150> cooler<00:04:07.390> temps

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
have to deal with some cooler temps

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.599 
have to deal with some cooler temps
between<00:04:08.290> planting<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:08.890> germination<00:04:09.340> and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
between planting and germination and

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.300 
between planting and germination and
emergence<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:11.049> year<00:04:11.320> we<00:04:11.500> were<00:04:11.620> fortunate<00:04:11.650> we

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
emergence this year we were fortunate we

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.710 
emergence this year we were fortunate we
didn't<00:04:12.549> have<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.820> deal<00:04:13.030> with<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.450> the

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
didn't have to deal with that the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.990 
didn't have to deal with that the
temperatures<00:04:14.620> stayed<00:04:14.890> warm<00:04:15.130> basically<00:04:15.850> from

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
temperatures stayed warm basically from

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.509 
temperatures stayed warm basically from

April<00:04:22.129> we<00:04:22.310> had<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.610> cool<00:04:22.819> weekend<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.419> corn

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
April we had that cool weekend the corn

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.360 
April we had that cool weekend the corn
had<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> chance<00:04:24.139> to<00:04:24.319> germinate<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.949> was<00:04:25.039> on<00:04:25.190> its

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
had a chance to germinate it was on its

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.809 
had a chance to germinate it was on its
way

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
way

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.270 
way
corn<00:04:26.569> planted<00:04:27.050> during<00:04:27.289> that<00:04:27.560> cool<00:04:27.800> weekend

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
corn planted during that cool weekend

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.850 
corn planted during that cool weekend
was<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.490> different<00:04:28.879> story<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.530> with<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.620> soil

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
was a different story and with the soil

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.860 
was a different story and with the soil
temperatures<00:04:31.370> cooling<00:04:31.639> off<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.599> furrow

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
temperatures cooling off the furrow

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.960 
temperatures cooling off the furrow
became<00:04:33.379> an<00:04:33.530> ideal<00:04:33.889> temperature<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:34.550> these

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
became an ideal temperature for these

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.300 
became an ideal temperature for these
millipedes<00:04:35.300> to<00:04:35.750> settle<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.259> and<00:04:36.620> feed<00:04:37.099> on<00:04:37.280> a

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
millipedes to settle in and feed on a

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.390 
millipedes to settle in and feed on a
decaying<00:04:37.699> seed<00:04:38.409> which<00:04:39.409> essentially<00:04:39.979> is<00:04:40.310> a

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
decaying seed which essentially is a

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.430 
decaying seed which essentially is a
primary<00:04:40.970> food<00:04:41.240> source<00:04:41.569> for<00:04:41.810> them<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.169> they<00:04:42.259> go

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
primary food source for them and they go

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.439 
primary food source for them and they go
right<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.069> not<00:04:43.250> uncommon<00:04:43.699> to<00:04:43.909> see<00:04:44.210> a

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
right to it and not uncommon to see a

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.960 
right to it and not uncommon to see a
pile<00:04:45.139> of<00:04:45.169> millipedes<00:04:45.770> like<00:04:46.009> not<00:04:46.220> go<00:04:46.460> after<00:04:46.940> a

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
pile of millipedes like not go after a

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.990 
pile of millipedes like not go after a
seed<00:04:47.569> so<00:04:48.500> really<00:04:48.770> important<00:04:49.220> early<00:04:49.550> planting

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
seed so really important early planting

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.420 
seed so really important early planting

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
ready to grow died off early and we're

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.520 
ready to grow died off early and we're
gonna<00:04:57.710> plant<00:04:58.039> early<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.550> look<00:04:58.789> at<00:04:58.909> that<00:04:59.090> 48<00:04:59.780> 72

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
gonna plant early but look at that 48 72

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.990 
gonna plant early but look at that 48 72
and<00:05:00.770> even<00:05:01.270> seven-day<00:05:02.270> forecast<00:05:02.900> too<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.789> see

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
and even seven-day forecast too to see

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.580 
and even seven-day forecast too to see
what<00:05:05.030> our<00:05:05.180> soil<00:05:05.539> temperatures<00:05:06.080> are<00:05:06.229> going<00:05:06.440> to

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
what our soil temperatures are going to

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.520 
what our soil temperatures are going to
do<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.610> if<00:05:07.879> it's<00:05:08.030> going<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.300> cool<00:05:08.569> off<00:05:08.810> get<00:05:09.169> too

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
do and if it's going to cool off get too

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.770 
do and if it's going to cool off get too
close<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.009> frost<00:05:10.280> at<00:05:10.520> night<00:05:10.729> for<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.449> couple<00:05:11.569> of

close to frost at night for a couple of
nights<00:05:11.960> in<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.199> row<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.830> might<00:05:13.009> be<00:05:13.129> best<00:05:13.370> just

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
nights in a row you might be best just

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.129 
nights in a row you might be best just
to<00:05:13.729> sit<00:05:13.940> tight<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.389> a<00:05:14.479> condition<00:05:14.930> like<00:05:14.960> this

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
to sit tight in a condition like this

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.589 
to sit tight in a condition like this
and<00:05:15.530> let<00:05:15.650> this<00:05:15.800> field<00:05:16.069> sit<00:05:16.460> until<00:05:17.210> we<00:05:17.330> get<00:05:17.539> a

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
and let this field sit until we get a

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.659 
and let this field sit until we get a
good<00:05:17.900> 5<00:05:18.169> or<00:05:18.199> 7<00:05:18.500> day<00:05:18.770> warm<00:05:19.039> stretch<00:05:19.400> in<00:05:19.580> the

good 5 or 7 day warm stretch in the

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.490 
good 5 or 7 day warm stretch in the
forecast<00:05:20.120> then<00:05:20.389> go<00:05:20.539> ahead<00:05:20.629> and<00:05:20.900> plant<00:05:21.139> it<00:05:21.319> and

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
forecast then go ahead and plant it and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.469 
forecast then go ahead and plant it and
that'll<00:05:22.159> create<00:05:22.340> your<00:05:22.520> best<00:05:22.729> opportunity<00:05:23.449> to

that'll create your best opportunity to

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.779 
that'll create your best opportunity to
get<00:05:23.690> full<00:05:23.960> emergence<00:05:24.469> in<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.710> field<00:05:24.949> get<00:05:25.610> your

full stand this one here is 40 mm and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.399 
full stand this one here is 40 mm and
it's<00:05:28.940> pretty<00:05:29.240> much<00:05:29.389> right<00:05:29.630> full<00:05:30.020> so

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
it's pretty much right full so

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.439 
it's pretty much right full so
everything<00:05:31.340> worked<00:05:31.520> out<00:05:31.699> right<00:05:31.880> here<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:32.330> I'm

everything worked out right here and I'm

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.209 
everything worked out right here and I'm
really<00:05:32.690> really<00:05:32.990> optimistic<00:05:33.860> about<00:05:33.979> this

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
really really optimistic about this

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.790 
really really optimistic about this
