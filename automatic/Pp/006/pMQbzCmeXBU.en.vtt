00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160 
them or I just have to see somewhere to
work<00:03:10.890> but<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.820> was<00:03:11.970> right<00:03:12.150> on<00:03:12.180> Boulevard<00:03:12.810> upon<00:03:13.140> a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
work but I was right on Boulevard upon a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.949 
work but I was right on Boulevard upon a
ladder<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.860> got<00:03:14.670> down<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.209> realized<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.780> had

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
ladder I got down and realized I had

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.740 
ladder I got down and realized I had
done<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.320> backwards<00:03:16.830> called<00:03:17.070> mom<00:03:17.400> you're<00:03:17.760> my

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
done it backwards called mom you're my

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.470 
done it backwards called mom you're my
never<00:03:18.930> than<00:03:19.080> accident<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.550> then<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.940> gave<00:03:21.360> me

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
never than accident and then I gave me

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.240 
never than accident and then I gave me
the<00:03:21.600> idea<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.959> make<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.680> them<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:22.980> switch

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the idea to make more of them and switch

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.949 
the idea to make more of them and switch
them<00:03:23.400> out<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:23.910> them<00:03:24.030> backwards<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.840> was

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
them out and do them backwards that was

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.890 
them out and do them backwards that was
a<00:03:24.990> true<00:03:25.430> screw-up<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:27.090> think<00:03:27.540> that's<00:03:27.690> why<00:03:27.870> I

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
a true screw-up but I think that's why I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660 
a true screw-up but I think that's why I
can<00:03:28.200> keep<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.620> doing<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.100> because<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.640> just

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
can keep on doing it because it just

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.280 
can keep on doing it because it just
keeps<00:03:30.120> changing<00:03:30.769> same<00:03:31.769> pain<00:03:32.160> same<00:03:33.290> brushes

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
keeps changing same pain same brushes

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.590 
keeps changing same pain same brushes
change<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.370> different<00:03:35.730> material<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.360> paint

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
it's true and if that makes you do

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.420 
it's true and if that makes you do
better<00:04:52.440> stuff<00:04:52.770> right<00:04:53.010> now<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:55.130> had<00:04:56.130> somebody
