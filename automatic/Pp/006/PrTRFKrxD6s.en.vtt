00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.850 
that we don't have to go over it but
what<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.790> expect<00:00:49.570> I'm<00:00:49.780> definitely<00:00:50.350> coming<00:00:50.620> up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860

what I expect I'm definitely coming up
soon<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:52.830> think<00:00:53.830> there<00:00:53.950> might<00:00:54.070> be<00:00:54.130> another<00:00:54.610> dark

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
soon I think there might be another dark

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.940 
soon I think there might be another dark
trip<00:00:55.270> I<00:00:55.390> mean<00:00:55.600> there's<00:00:55.750> still<00:00:55.840> four<00:00:56.290> slots<00:00:56.650> in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
trip I mean there's still four slots in

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.550 
trip I mean there's still four slots in
the<00:00:56.980> dark<00:00:57.310> barracks<00:00:57.760> like<00:00:58.090> for<00:00:58.840> them<00:00:58.960> that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
the dark barracks like for them that

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.320 
the dark barracks like for them that
that<00:00:59.800> has<00:00:59.920> that<00:00:59.950> coming<00:01:00.490> soon<00:01:00.730> mark<00:01:01.060> thing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
that has that coming soon mark thing

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.930 
that has that coming soon mark thing
there<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:01.990> I<00:01:02.230> definitely<00:01:02.800> expect<00:01:03.310> those<00:01:03.610> I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
there so I definitely expect those I

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.420 
there so I definitely expect those I
mean<00:01:04.360> there<00:01:04.869> could<00:01:05.080> be<00:01:05.110> one<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:06.040> might<00:01:06.100> not<00:01:06.369> be

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
mean there could be one it might not be

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.010 
mean there could be one it might not be
in<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.640> next<00:01:06.820> update<00:01:07.030> but<00:01:07.420> maybe<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.900> one

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
in the next update but maybe the one

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.810 
in the next update but maybe the one
after<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.350> because<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:09.040> witches<00:01:09.340> did<00:01:09.549> come

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
after that because of witches did come

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.690 
after that because of witches did come
out<00:01:09.850> like<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.509> few<00:01:11.049> months<00:01:11.200> ago<00:01:11.439> so<00:01:12.340> it's<00:01:12.490> been

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
out like a few months ago so it's been

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.450 
out like a few months ago so it's been
quite<00:01:12.939> some<00:01:12.970> time<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.799> definitely

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
quite some time that's definitely

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.670 
quite some time that's definitely
something<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.820> want<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.119> expect<00:01:16.570> as<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:17.350> dark

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
something you want to expect as a dark

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.109 
something you want to expect as a dark
troop<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.710> year<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.159> mean<00:01:21.520> it'll

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
troop and also this year I mean it'll

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.779 
troop and also this year I mean it'll
happen<00:01:22.359> at<00:01:22.570> some<00:01:22.749> point<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.109> year<00:01:23.170> but<00:01:23.560> um

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
happen at some point this year but um

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.270 
happen at some point this year but um
maybe<00:01:24.789> sooner<00:01:25.539> than<00:01:25.719> we<00:01:25.840> think<00:01:26.049> level<00:01:26.890> 7

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
maybe sooner than we think level 7

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.819 
maybe sooner than we think level 7
troops<00:01:27.640> could<00:01:28.240> possibly<00:01:28.840> come<00:01:29.109> like<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.530> really

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
troops could possibly come like I really

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.639 
troops could possibly come like I really
think<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.600> that's<00:01:31.929> where<00:01:32.409> they<00:01:32.499> have

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
think that that that's where they have

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.099 
think that that that's where they have
to<00:01:32.770> go<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.280> mean<00:01:33.729> they<00:01:34.030> got<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.509> do<00:01:34.630> something<00:01:35.020> to

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
to go I mean they got to do something to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.260 
to go I mean they got to do something to
step<00:01:35.319> it<00:01:35.469> up<00:01:35.530> with<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.799> troops<00:01:36.039> so<00:01:36.819> I<00:01:36.850> think<00:01:37.030> I

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
step it up with the troops so I think I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.219 
step it up with the troops so I think I
definitely<00:01:37.329> think<00:01:37.780> they're<00:01:37.960> going<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.109> have

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
definitely think they're going to have

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.069 
definitely think they're going to have
some<00:01:38.499> go<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.859> level<00:01:39.340> 7<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.729> mean<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.899> don't<00:01:41.020> have

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
some go to level 7 I mean you don't have

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.959 
some go to level 7 I mean you don't have
to<00:01:41.200> make<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.499> like<00:01:41.649> all<00:01:41.829> of<00:01:42.009> them<00:01:42.100> like<00:01:42.429> I<00:01:42.640> mean

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
to make it like all of them like I mean

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.690 
to make it like all of them like I mean
just<00:01:43.149> do<00:01:43.270> tier<00:01:43.569> 1<00:01:43.810> troops<00:01:44.109> like<00:01:44.380> like<00:01:45.310> level

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
just do tier 1 troops like like level

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.120 
just do tier 1 troops like like level

archers like Tia tier one true like you
can<00:01:50.170> just<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.409> them<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.770> level<00:01:51.039> 7<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.429> don't

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
can just do them to level 7 you don't

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.989 
can just do them to level 7 you don't
really<00:01:51.670> need<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.979> like<00:01:54.189> wizards<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.850> then

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
really need to do like wizards and then

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.090 
really need to do like wizards and then
you<00:01:55.149> don't<00:01:55.299> have<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:55.929> you<00:01:56.499> don't<00:01:56.950> have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
you don't have to do the you don't have

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.249 
you don't have to do the you don't have
to<00:01:57.249> make<00:01:57.369> them<00:01:57.579> go<00:01:57.609> to<00:01:57.789> level<00:01:58.090> 7<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.139> like

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
to make them go to level 7 just do like

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.370 
to make them go to level 7 just do like
tier<00:01:59.560> 1<00:01:59.740> troops<00:02:00.539> so<00:02:01.539> that's<00:02:01.840> what<00:02:01.959> I<00:02:02.049> think

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
tier 1 troops so that's what I think

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.770 
tier 1 troops so that's what I think
they<00:02:02.499> should<00:02:02.709> definitely<00:02:03.009> do<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:03.780> also

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
they should definitely do and also

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.010 
they should definitely do and also
another<00:02:05.679> thing<00:02:05.829> too<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.399> really<00:02:07.389> this<00:02:07.539> dish

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
another thing too that really this dish

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.350 
another thing too that really this dish
is<00:02:08.050> probably<00:02:08.709> coming<00:02:09.009> up<00:02:09.250> like<00:02:09.490> really<00:02:09.819> soon<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
is probably coming up like really soon a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.340 
is probably coming up like really soon a
level<00:02:11.110> 8<00:02:11.260> Tesla<00:02:12.120> there's<00:02:13.120> only<00:02:13.480> level<00:02:13.900> 7<00:02:14.230> out

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
level 8 Tesla there's only level 7 out

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.630 
level 8 Tesla there's only level 7 out
now<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:16.410> all<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.680> defense's<00:02:18.280> there

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
now this is the all the defense's there

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.039 
now this is the all the defense's there
either<00:02:18.850> level<00:02:19.510> 12<00:02:19.959> or<00:02:20.880> level<00:02:21.880> 8<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.659> like

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
either level 12 or level 8 and then like

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.589 
either level 12 or level 8 and then like
there's<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.250> mortars<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.819> the

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
there's it like the mortars and the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.059 
there's it like the mortars and the
wizard<00:02:25.900> tires<00:02:26.049> like<00:02:26.260> their<00:02:26.439> level<00:02:26.680> 8<00:02:26.799> in<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
wizard tires like their level 8 in the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.690 
wizard tires like their level 8 in the
air<00:02:27.189> defense<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.670> level<00:02:27.909> 8<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
air defense I level 8 and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.610 
air defense I level 8 and
you<00:02:28.819> got<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> cannons<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.080> archer

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
you got the cannons and the archer

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.080 
you got the cannons and the archer
towers<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:32.050> they<00:02:33.050> are<00:02:33.230> level<00:02:33.530> 12<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.910> you

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
towers and they are level 12 so like you

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.520 
towers and they are level 12 so like you
see<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.269> mean<00:02:35.599> they're<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.080> there's<00:02:36.260> definitely

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
see I mean they're so there's definitely

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.670 
see I mean they're so there's definitely
expect<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.610> level<00:02:38.090> 8<00:02:38.209> Tesla<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.319> get<00:02:39.500> them

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
expect a level 8 Tesla just to get them

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.880 
expect a level 8 Tesla just to get them
up<00:02:39.890> with<00:02:40.160> those<00:02:40.310> other<00:02:40.550> level<00:02:41.030> 8<00:02:41.209> defenses

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
up with those other level 8 defenses

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.229 
up with those other level 8 defenses
that's<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.370> definitely<00:02:43.819> something<00:02:44.000> you

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
that's that's definitely something you

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
that's that's definitely something you
want<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.629> expect<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:46.670> don't<00:02:47.480> know<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:49.069> is

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
want to expect and I don't know this is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.220 
want to expect and I don't know this is
probably<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:50.000> don't<00:02:50.450> know<00:02:50.599> about<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.930> one<00:02:50.989> but

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
probably I don't know about this one but

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.490 
probably I don't know about this one but
um<00:02:51.380> maybe<00:02:51.800> another<00:02:52.190> Tesla<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.180> mean<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.290> says

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
um maybe another Tesla I mean that says

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.619 
um maybe another Tesla I mean that says
oh<00:02:54.739> god<00:02:54.980> oh<00:02:55.220> god<00:02:55.310> maybe<00:02:55.880> another<00:02:56.150> expo<00:02:57.110> upgrade

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
oh god oh god maybe another expo upgrade

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.960 
oh god oh god maybe another expo upgrade
I'm<00:02:59.629> really<00:02:59.750> not<00:02:59.930> sure<00:02:59.989> about<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:01.040> one<00:03:01.370> I

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
I'm really not sure about that one I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.030 
I'm really not sure about that one I
don't<00:03:02.630> know<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.319> because<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.799> ain't

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
don't know if that because it ain't

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.190 
don't know if that because it ain't
their<00:03:04.280> only<00:03:04.519> level<00:03:04.730> for<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.810> could<00:03:06.019> go<00:03:06.170> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
their only level for you could go to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.809 
their only level for you could go to
five<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.739> them<00:03:06.920> they're<00:03:07.160> kind<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.430> really<00:03:07.700> on

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
five with them they're kind of really on

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.100 
five with them they're kind of really on
their<00:03:07.970> own<00:03:08.120> they're<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.720> inferno

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
their own they're like the inferno

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.600 
their own they're like the inferno
towers<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.590> front<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:09.890> towers<00:03:10.160> are<00:03:10.250> only<00:03:10.310> level

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
towers in front of towers are only level

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.479 
towers in front of towers are only level
three<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:12.380> they<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.920> then<00:03:13.069> expose

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
three and like they and then expose

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.630 
three and like they and then expose
deliver<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.510> definitely<00:03:14.780> maybe

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
deliver for but you can definitely maybe

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.420 
deliver for but you can definitely maybe
expect<00:03:16.640> an<00:03:16.819> update<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.720> them<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:19.069> give<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.340> to

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
expect an update for them to give it to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.400 
expect an update for them to give it to
like<00:03:19.610> level<00:03:19.849> five<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:22.030> um<00:03:23.030> one<00:03:23.900> last<00:03:23.930> thing<00:03:24.260> I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
like level five and um one last thing I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.309 
like level five and um one last thing I
want<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.650> talk<00:03:24.829> about<00:03:25.540> town<00:03:26.540> hall<00:03:26.959> 11<00:03:27.799> um

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
want to talk about town hall 11 um

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.819 
want to talk about town hall 11 um
highly<00:03:30.319> unlikely<00:03:30.769> i<00:03:31.069> don't<00:03:31.730> see<00:03:31.880> coming<00:03:32.120> soon

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
highly unlikely i don't see coming soon

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.449 
highly unlikely i don't see coming soon
maybe<00:03:33.829> at<00:03:34.010> some<00:03:34.040> point<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:36.170> um<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.859> then<00:03:37.069> if

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
maybe at some point but um and then if

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.490 
maybe at some point but um and then if
if<00:03:37.850> they<00:03:38.060> added<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.510> town<00:03:38.750> hall<00:03:39.049> they<00:03:39.290> might

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
if they added a town hall they might

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.900 
if they added a town hall they might
have<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.739> come<00:03:39.889> up<00:03:39.920> with<00:03:40.040> some<00:03:40.310> new<00:03:40.340> defense

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
have to come up with some new defense

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.539 
have to come up with some new defense
but<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:41.870> i<00:03:41.900> wouldn't<00:03:42.319> expect<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.829> really<00:03:43.489> i

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
but so i wouldn't expect that really i

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.190 
but so i wouldn't expect that really i
really<00:03:43.579> don't<00:03:44.000> expect<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:44.690> that's<00:03:44.989> just

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
really don't expect that that's just

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.400 
really don't expect that that's just
maybe<00:03:45.709> some<00:03:46.010> i<00:03:46.630> wouldn't<00:03:47.630> expect<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:47.959> soon

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
maybe some i wouldn't expect that soon

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.559 
maybe some i wouldn't expect that soon
but<00:03:49.010> at<00:03:49.250> some<00:03:49.459> point<00:03:49.489> we<00:03:49.850> will<00:03:49.880> get<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.329> I

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
but at some point we will get that I

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.170 
but at some point we will get that I
definitely<00:03:51.049> think<00:03:53.109> yeah<00:03:54.109> so<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:55.069> walls<00:03:55.400> will

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
definitely think yeah so I in walls will

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360 
definitely think yeah so I in walls will
talk<00:03:56.329> about<00:03:56.420> walls<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.870> level<00:03:57.380> 11<00:03:57.799> like<00:03:58.010> people

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
talk about walls a level 11 like people

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.150 
talk about walls a level 11 like people
hate<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:59.060> how<00:03:59.239> they're<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.780> expensive<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> I

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
hate like how they're so expensive so I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.259 
hate like how they're so expensive so I
really<00:04:01.489> doubt<00:04:01.700> they're<00:04:01.940> going<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.120> do

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
really doubt they're going to do

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.670 
really doubt they're going to do
anything<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.810> make<00:04:02.930> those<00:04:03.170> even<00:04:03.440> more

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
anything to make those even more

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.970 
anything to make those even more
expensive<00:04:04.480> but<00:04:05.480> I'm<00:04:05.900> really<00:04:06.230> hoping<00:04:06.650> I

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
expensive but I'm really hoping I

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.210 
expensive but I'm really hoping I
actually<00:04:07.609> I'm<00:04:08.540> love<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.769> Tesla<00:04:10.160> is

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
actually I'm love the Tesla is
