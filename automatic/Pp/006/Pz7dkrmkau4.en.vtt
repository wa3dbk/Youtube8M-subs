00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Welcome to a new update from the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.060
 small farm today the construction report to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.649
 dsf rabbit hutch left the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 Rabbit hutch right the option too 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.889
 an update on the rabbits with 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.690
 Small leadership again stole today 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.980
 looks 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 Here you see the first 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.350
 planning that I did on the computer 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 with google sketchup is a free 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 Program with the 3D models 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 can create and that has me easy 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.199
 helped to calculate the dimensions and also 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 to get a feel for the dimension 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.710
 at the same time I could do so naturally 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 also calculate how much wood I am 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.600
 I needed and the whole thing was relative 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.670
 helpful to avoid first mistakes 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.010
 or to be able to uncover errors 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 would normally happen at building 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 if you do not do that now 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.730
 complete model on the pc would have designed 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.379
 you'll see the ones downstairs 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 grid construction for the guitar spot 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.539
 and then a bottom plate on top 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.730
 cheeks come for the tubs 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.730
 rabbit stalls yes 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.180
 all he went I first 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.030
 the wood sells the cost of that 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.409
 complete material lay around the 85th 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.270
 euro gitta is not involved 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.229
 included 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.649
 You see, I had already started 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.049
 to cut something and that the pvc is allowed 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.119
 what the circuit is on it and to this day 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.399
 actually works well to it by the 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.049
 parking space at the rabbit hutch and 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.670
 should stand later next to the 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.240
 water tons and on the other side 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.520
 where the raised bed should be 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.229
 you also see the grids here as well 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.270
 rabbit stalls for the first floor 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.640
 below 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.039
 with the dimensions 50 x 70 x 55 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.560
 I also took over the measurements 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.210
 on the substructure for the guitar 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.310
 place each one on the spot 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.549
 between lattice to the next crash part 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.289
 were strengthened with a latte 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.090
 and the whole thing makes for enough 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.670
 stability and is possible for me too 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.959
 so to speak, the rabbit hutch with the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.940
 screw down the base plate 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.610
 at the end of the whole was then still with 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.250
 stabilized and I have to say 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.870
 it actually became very unstable 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.850
 Here you see that left and right 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.299
 at the between grids one each 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.010
 bar attached to these then with 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.010
 to screw the bottom plate 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.320
 the whole thing was relatively stable though 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
 a lot of work in the manufacturing process 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.660
 because the grid is not really good 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 let it bend and you see it then 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.440
 how it looks like once it does 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.780
 screwed together with the help of 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.340
 screw it went then and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.080
 meanwhile I have the one 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.420
 subdivision taken out again at around 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.120
 offer the rammer more space, so to speak 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.570
 to be able to do here directly the ground 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.010
 or the post screwed on one 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.650
 height of I do not know exactly 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.620
 I guess 70 centimeters were there 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.390
 yes, sure that did not want to go to any 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.580
 fall from below any marten or 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.710
 Cats scattering the rabbits around 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.100
 because I can attack on the internet 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.200
 had seen several videos where 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.240
 Rabbits had foot injuries because 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.700
 they were attacked from below at night 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.200
 by marten etc 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.490
 Here you see that we the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.100
 rabbit hutch then already on board 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.840
 have worn where he later stand 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.520
 should because the whole thing has always been 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.040
 heavier and then we have from the outside 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.270
 the outer lining screwed up 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.900
 started and then gone down 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.510
 worked 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.060
 the roof is already on it and 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.400
 you see the rabbits stand 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.130
 on concrete flow or on four 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.010
 Concrete plates around the moisture something 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.200
 and later it was still with 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 splits filled in and sufficient 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.920
 allow ventilation 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.850
 that's how it looks for the time being 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.740
 completed 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.840
 the doors are missing from the rest 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.230
 By the way, I have a raised bed 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.870
 built right next to the rabbit hutch 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.820
 and on the one hand to the whole the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.410
 all the crap accumulates 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.570
 can and on the other hand of course 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.860
 a cultivation area to enlarge her 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.260
 you also see that the 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.570
 remaining lattice pieces for the floor 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.430
 it was hard to wind down 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.130
 make in the high picture and come 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.090
 also a plastic panel that 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.380
 wood of the Lazy prevents that's I 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.850
 Hope you liked it here you see 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.500
 Once again, two options 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.940
 do it yourself a box currently in the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.640
 use is and on the other side 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.680
 the rabbits with the third update the 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.880
 of course the netbox used if 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.470
 you liked it then subscribed 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.620
 but main channel or thumb me 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.620
 high
