00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.419
 hello guys how about here goes nfs and good 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.009
 we are here with ghost ex hello that such and 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.690
 we extract what would be chapter 7 of 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.269
 hunting of the llanitos and this time 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.209
 let's investigate the myth or the mystery 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.260
 of the monster of Loch Ness in a village 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:20.390
 quite peculiar quite mysterious not 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.210
 and we will not see what is in this saying 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.960
 village 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.310
 because it interests you the location would be 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.419
 near the east lake that is here the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.340
 poplar yes yes that is a small outgoing 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.480
 what's out there if we're going to lower a 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.420
 little to see if you see the town 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.050
 in the village there are three little houses 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.570
 they are not very fantastic or they are not very 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.140
 mysterious but they are not called a little 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.270
 Attention 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 there is no one if there is a gay person here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.449
 sitting 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 as if it were good down then I'm going to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.579
 be here step 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 but the human eggs the town by the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.380
 night gives pretty bad roll and a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.000
 publicity and heard this morning with the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 campaign mode the possibility michael he 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.430
 came to this location and fired 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.430
 but that the polis was still pretty 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.850
 weird but here in the individual there is in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.070
 the online we have tried and if it would be 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.440
 of a game so let's go to what 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 I'm interested 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.890
 what is the supposed lake of ness lake not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.590
 which is pretty much like no 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.200
 like it is quite similar the truth is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.780
 that for those who have seen you have 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.940
 seen the east lake of scotland in which 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 it is supposed to inhabit the beautiful lake of 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.050
 Lake Ness is quite similar but not 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.830
 is the mythical constructions 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.780
 be destroyed 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.980
 and instead of that then here is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.740
 a holiday like abandoned 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.600
 as if they were not there and you also have to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.890
 say that in the morning there are people in the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.320
 village 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.330
 but well, if we are going to see a 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.520
 little bit here there is a boat 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.729
 they 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.890
 we are not going to see a little bit for the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.599
 depths of what is the lake 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.599
 so something mysterious 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.360
 The truth is that I do not know what may be 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.130
 know it does not exist but but it can 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.270
 be a recreation if you will have that 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.930
 curiosity not to leave an hour if a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.819
 the same time or same place you know 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 while advertising 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.540
 it's quite mysterious, so we're going to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.010
 look here a little 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.730
 as this night will not see you 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.470
 but not if there does not seem to be anything 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 there seems to be nothing otherworldly 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.780
 but nevertheless what we have said gives 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.780
 quite badly bad roll for that 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.300
 OK 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.060
 Well, this is the surroundings 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.150
 of what is the place where the monster lives 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.489
 Loch Ness safest thing you 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.840
 I think it coincides with me that it is a lie 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.720
 no here no no no nothing but no 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.120
 we believe that this exists but not 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.160
 I know maybe there may be a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.730
 recreation there may be something like 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.470
 similar but we do not believe it so 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.840
 if you think we are going to investigate a 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.550
 little more the town 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.739
 because he can shut us up on some track or 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.480
 something like that though in the 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.010
 boat 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.970
 you have a flashlight over 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.730
 it's pretty I do not know how it was 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.129
 abandoned not of a few years ago and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.280
 then it appears that it is very recent if 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.640
 let's explain and here they raised us c4 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.100
 let's stand aside a little bit 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.160
 teams can no longer destroy that 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.640
 can be destroyed is quite like saying 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.340
 pretty weird 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.690
 and you are leaving the hundred 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.640
 one hundred 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.240
 I do not think I 'm here for 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.390
 little time 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.940
 if we are going to look for a little clues or in 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.820
 the town or something I'm something I can see 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.280
 strange 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.970
 people do not know is peculiar is not a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.970
 normal front 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.410
 has some pints that are not 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.020
 the atmosphere of the town among this 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:36.530
 powerful but strange and mysterious and if 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:41.950
 you see here there are clothes of life but we 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:45.889
 it's quite mysterious like that lying broken 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.620
 our bony tissues 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.009
 pretty pretty weird there's also 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.599
 details of cars burned here 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.580
 but the houses as I said if they are 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.750
 Mysterious but they do not seem at all 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.580
 world then 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.710
 it does not seem like anything from another world we're going to 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.470
 say I do not think but let's see let's 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.830
 throw c4 over here 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:12.130
 death did not 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.190
 it's pretty weird and also here 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.710
 we have a flag of america 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.500
 maybe you can go up no no no I do not think 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.440
 that can be raised 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.080
 but good, well, this would be all 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.710
 seventh mystery and we both agree 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.600
 that no link does not exist 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.480
 your work at least for now to 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.550
 I think unless an update 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.610
 yes I think it will be an update not 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.250
 If you're there will still be a few but 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.280
 they will still be there if I believe that an insurance 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.100
 but hey it's pretty weird in what it is 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.020
 the town and how do I know how we told you 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.060
 we both agree that there is no 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.800
 no monster at least so far 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.870
 nothing I hope you liked this 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.669
 seventh chapter of myth winners and 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.669
 see you in the next god god
