00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this there is this thing there is this a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.369 
this there is this thing there is this a
bug<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.430> tier<00:00:57.030> 15<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:59.660> retro<00:01:00.660> paladins<00:01:02.180> that

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
bug with tier 15 of retro paladins that

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
bug with tier 15 of retro paladins that
basically<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.769> does<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.760> tamela's<00:01:06.360> verdict

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
basically it does your tamela's verdict

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.039 
basically it does your tamela's verdict
does<00:01:07.850> full-on<00:01:08.930> holy<00:01:09.930> damage<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.840> they

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
does full-on holy damage so I think they

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.460 
does full-on holy damage so I think they
didn't<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.979> find<00:01:14.369> him<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.170> well<00:01:16.170> enough

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
didn't really find him that well enough

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
didn't really find him that well enough
so<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> use<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.640> pvp<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.750> want

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so if you use it in pvp you just want

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.749 
so if you use it in pvp you just want
your<00:01:19.590> people<00:01:19.950> something<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.759> yeah
