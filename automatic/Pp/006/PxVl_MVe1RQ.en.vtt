00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
because I really didn't plan on showing

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.850 
because I really didn't plan on showing
this<00:00:12.540> play<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.110> something<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.530> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this play this is something that I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.550 
this play this is something that I
probably<00:00:14.160> use<00:00:14.519> almost<00:00:15.030> all<00:00:15.360> year<00:00:15.599> long<00:00:15.839> it's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
probably use almost all year long it's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.769 
probably use almost all year long it's
really<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> run<00:00:17.850> defense<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
really my go to run defense but the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.990 
really my go to run defense but the
reason<00:00:19.740> why<00:00:19.980> i<00:00:20.010> wasn't<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> show<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
reason why i wasn't going to show it is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.730 
reason why i wasn't going to show it is
because<00:00:21.300> i<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.420> don't<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.230> has<00:00:22.439> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
because i just don't think it has that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.400 
because i just don't think it has that
look<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> money<00:00:24.150> type<00:00:24.720> run<00:00:24.990> defense

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
look of like a money type run defense

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.769 
look of like a money type run defense
it's<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.400> something<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.970> preferred<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it's just something that I preferred and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
it's just something that I preferred and
the<00:00:28.320> reason<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.830> prefer<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.460> because

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the reason that I prefer to this because

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
the reason that I prefer to this because
it<00:00:30.179> does<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.900> job<00:00:30.960> against<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it does a really good job against the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
it does a really good job against the
run<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> also<00:00:32.610> does<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.180> good<00:00:33.360> job

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
run but it also does a really good job

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
run but it also does a really good job
against<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> past<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.590> didn't<00:00:34.860> look

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
against the past but it just didn't look

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.760 
against the past but it just didn't look
anything<00:00:35.460> flashy<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.870> today<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> figured<00:00:37.680> you

do<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> great<00:01:29.340> job<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:30.049> stretches<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.259> tosses

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
do a great job on stretches and tosses

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.620 
do a great job on stretches and tosses
and<00:01:31.950> things<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.340> plus<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and things like that plus we have the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
and things like that plus we have the
two<00:01:33.869> flat<00:01:34.200> zones<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> outside<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.270> we

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
two flat zones on the outside so if we

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.490 
two flat zones on the outside so if we
think<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> run<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
think that they're going to run in the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.990 
think that they're going to run in the
middle<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.310> we've<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.790> box

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
middle you know look we've got the box

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
middle you know look we've got the box
covered<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.630> seven<00:01:39.960> defenders<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
covered with seven defenders this is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.899 
covered with seven defenders this is
something<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> they're<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> want

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
something that they're not going to want

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
something that they're not going to want
to<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> they're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
even sometimes kind of think twice you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.370 
even sometimes kind of think twice you
know<00:01:58.680> maybe<00:01:58.979> maybe<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.060> time<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.420> perfectly<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
know maybe maybe I time it perfectly and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.490 
know maybe maybe I time it perfectly and
I'm<00:02:01.710> able<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> stop<00:02:02.310> their<00:02:02.490> outside<00:02:02.820> run<00:02:03.060> or

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
maybe I you know mess up and I do it a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
maybe I you know mess up and I do it a
little<00:02:06.390> ahead<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.689> time<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
little ahead of time then they get to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
little ahead of time then they get to
see<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:08.759> running<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.679> outside

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.210 
see that I'm running you know outside
and<00:02:10.830> containment<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.550> there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and containment and there

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
all men well maybe I might have to run

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.990 
all men well maybe I might have to run
up<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.680> middle<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.980> field<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.820> they're

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
up the middle of the field so they're

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.700 
up the middle of the field so they're
going<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> hesitate<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.750> offense<00:02:17.200> maybe<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.560> get

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
going to hesitate on offense maybe I get

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.020 
going to hesitate on offense maybe I get
a<00:02:17.740> delay<00:02:18.010> game<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.340> know<00:02:18.430> there's<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.790> so

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
a delay game you know there's just so

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.140 
a delay game you know there's just so
many<00:02:19.180> factors<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.980> making<00:02:21.340> changes<00:02:21.940> right

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
many factors in to making changes right

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150 
many factors in to making changes right
at<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.360> last<00:02:22.540> second<00:02:22.960> based<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.440> guessing

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
at the last second based on guessing

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.190 
at the last second based on guessing
what<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> offense<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.570> going<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.140> this

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
what the offense is going to do and this

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.680 
what the offense is going to do and this
has<00:02:26.380> served<00:02:26.830> me<00:02:27.100> pretty<00:02:27.400> well<00:02:27.580> with<00:02:28.510> this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
has served me pretty well with this

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.330 
has served me pretty well with this
combination<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.500> run<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.990> pass<00:02:31.990> defense<00:02:32.470> so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
combination of run and pass defense so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.880 
combination of run and pass defense so
again<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.790> really<00:02:34.150> nothing<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.320> to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
again it's really nothing that is is to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.610 
again it's really nothing that is is to
super<00:02:36.490> fancy<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.600> all<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> want<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> do<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.290> just

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
want them to think that I'm going to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.080 
want them to think that I'm going to
cover<00:03:01.780> whatever<00:03:02.530> area<00:03:03.010> against<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> run<00:03:03.880> or

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
then sometimes right when I'll do that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.160 
then sometimes right when I'll do that
just<00:03:10.150> when<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.330> think<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.750> they're<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.050> to

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
maybe if they're going to go to the left

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.229 
maybe if they're going to go to the left
what<00:03:17.739> I'll<00:03:17.860> do<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.040> I'll<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.459> I'll<00:03:18.640> stop<00:03:18.970> I'll

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.660 
what I'll do is I'll just I'll stop I'll
stop<00:03:19.330> right<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:19.870> mid<00:03:20.140> motion<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.430> they

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
stop right in mid motion so that they

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.610 
stop right in mid motion so that they
don't<00:03:21.880> catch<00:03:22.269> me<00:03:22.570> coming<00:03:22.930> down<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> certain

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
show anything as far as practice mode

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.380 
show anything as far as practice mode
because<00:04:27.250> it's<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.700> really<00:04:27.970> going<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.150> show

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
because it's not really going to show

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.910 
because it's not really going to show
how<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.780> run<00:04:29.110> defense<00:04:29.260> is<00:04:29.560> going<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.800> work

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
how the run defense is going to work

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.830 
how the run defense is going to work
specifically<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:31.120> let's<00:04:31.300> take<00:04:31.480> a<00:04:31.510> look<00:04:31.720> at

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
specifically but let's take a look at

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.770 
specifically but let's take a look at
what<00:04:31.990> outside<00:04:32.590> run<00:04:32.800> might<00:04:33.010> look<00:04:33.160> like<00:04:33.630> as<00:04:34.630> you

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
what outside run might look like as you

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.290 
what outside run might look like as you
can<00:04:34.870> see<00:04:35.080> here<00:04:35.380> there's<00:04:36.160> really<00:04:36.400> not<00:04:36.760> too<00:04:36.820> much

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
can see here there's really not too much

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.790 
can see here there's really not too much
they<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.630> do<00:04:37.840> yeah<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.350> computer

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
they can do yeah it's the computer

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.160 
they can do yeah it's the computer
player<00:04:39.040> there<00:04:39.730> was<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> little<00:04:40.270> bit<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.630> outside

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
player there was a little bit of outside

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.840 
player there was a little bit of outside
you<00:04:41.980> know<00:04:42.070> they<00:04:42.190> could<00:04:42.340> have<00:04:42.430> hit<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.640> outside

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
you know they could have hit the outside

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.510 
you know they could have hit the outside
a<00:04:43.030> little<00:04:43.120> bit<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.590> know<00:04:44.710> what<00:04:44.920> I've<00:04:45.160> seen

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
a little bit but you know what I've seen

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.340 
a little bit but you know what I've seen
this<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:45.880> many<00:04:45.940> times<00:04:46.120> with<00:04:46.540> this<00:04:46.690> run<00:04:46.900> defense

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
this so many times with this run defense

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.110 
this so many times with this run defense
where<00:04:47.980> they<00:04:48.070> try<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.310> hit<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.610> outside<00:04:48.730> and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
where they try to hit the outside and

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.610 
where they try to hit the outside and

guys are just coming off and making

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.720 
guys are just coming off and making
tackles<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:52.980> really<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.130> only<00:04:54.280> thing<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.700> I

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
tackles so really the only thing that I

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.000 
tackles so really the only thing that I
can<00:04:54.820> tell<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.270> guys<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.720> take<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.620> a<00:04:56.650> game

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
can tell you guys is take this to a game

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.640 
can tell you guys is take this to a game
and<00:04:57.250> try<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.120> use<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.570> exact<00:04:58.840> same<00:04:59.020> concept

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
and try to use the exact same concept

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.470 
and try to use the exact same concept
that<00:04:59.770> I've<00:04:59.920> been<00:05:00.040> showing<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.400> for<00:05:01.240> running

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
that I've been showing you for running

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.630 
that I've been showing you for running
or<00:05:01.780> passing<00:05:02.290> it's<00:05:02.860> not<00:05:03.100> something<00:05:03.460> that<00:05:03.490> I'm

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
or passing it's not something that I'm

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.430 
or passing it's not something that I'm
going<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:03.790> use<00:05:03.850> against<00:05:04.150> five<00:05:04.450> wide<00:05:04.810> or<00:05:05.110> four

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
going to use against five wide or four

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.620 
going to use against five wide or four
wide<00:05:05.680> necessarily<00:05:06.400> but<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.030> know<00:05:07.210> three<00:05:07.480> wide

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
wide necessarily but you know three wide

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.830 
wide necessarily but you know three wide
receivers<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.380> down<00:05:09.340> this<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:10.360> definitely<00:05:10.570> a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
receivers and down this is definitely a

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.660 
receivers and down this is definitely a
viable<00:05:11.320> option<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.860> stop<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.220> run<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.610> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
viable option to stop the run and the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.600 
viable option to stop the run and the
pass<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.210> just<00:05:13.750> make<00:05:13.960> your<00:05:14.140> opponent<00:05:14.610> really

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
pass and just make your opponent really

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.790 
pass and just make your opponent really
think<00:05:15.940> about<00:05:16.120> where<00:05:16.540> he's<00:05:16.660> going<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:16.900> go<00:05:17.050> by

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
think about where he's going to go by

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.340 
think about where he's going to go by
running<00:05:18.760> around<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.360> make<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.050> look<00:05:20.170> like

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
running around and make it a look like

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.020 
running around and make it a look like
you're<00:05:20.470> going<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.650> stop<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:21.370> area<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:21.790> field

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
you're going to stop this area the field

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.870 
you're going to stop this area the field
stop<00:05:22.420> that<00:05:22.690> area<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.080> field<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:24.490> things<00:05:24.760> like

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
stop that area the field and things like

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.060 
stop that area the field and things like
that<00:05:24.940> that's<00:05:25.240> pretty<00:05:25.420> much<00:05:25.510> all<00:05:25.630> i<00:05:25.690> do<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.710> i

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
that that's pretty much all i do so i

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.800 
that that's pretty much all i do so i
hope<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:27.760> was<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.000> lot<00:05:28.180> of<00:05:28.210> help<00:05:28.450> again<00:05:28.780> I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
hope this was a lot of help again I

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.390 
hope this was a lot of help again I
wasn't<00:05:29.320> going<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.530> show<00:05:29.710> this<00:05:29.890> because<00:05:30.100> it's

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
wasn't going to show this because it's

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.000 
wasn't going to show this because it's
just<00:05:30.580> one<00:05:30.730> of<00:05:30.760> those<00:05:30.850> things<00:05:30.940> where<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:32.830> have

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
just one of those things where you have

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.070 
just one of those things where you have
an<00:05:33.130> idea<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.700> you<00:05:34.030> go<00:05:34.210> with<00:05:34.390> it<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.720> that's

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
an idea and you go with it and that's

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.450 
an idea and you go with it and that's
really<00:05:35.290> what<00:05:35.500> I've<00:05:35.620> been<00:05:35.680> doing<00:05:35.800> all<00:05:36.010> year<00:05:36.220> but

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
really what I've been doing all year but

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.210 
really what I've been doing all year but
the<00:05:37.210> reality<00:05:37.720> is<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:38.380> is<00:05:38.560> my<00:05:38.680> go<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.860> run

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
the reality is this is my go to run

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.670 
the reality is this is my go to run
defense<00:05:39.580> so<00:05:39.930> just<00:05:40.930> take<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.230> for<00:05:41.380> what<00:05:41.500> it's

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
defense so just take it for what it's

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.280 
defense so just take it for what it's
worth<00:05:41.740> if<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.850> have<00:05:43.030> success<00:05:43.480> that's<00:05:43.990> great

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
worth if you have success that's great

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.100 
worth if you have success that's great
and<00:05:44.470> if<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:44.800> don't<00:05:45.070> then<00:05:45.600> stick<00:05:46.600> around<00:05:46.840> and

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
and if you don't then stick around and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.300 
and if you don't then stick around and
we<00:05:47.260> will<00:05:47.380> definitely<00:05:47.680> show<00:05:47.980> a<00:05:48.010> more

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
we will definitely show a more

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.570 
we will definitely show a more
conventional<00:05:48.760> run<00:05:49.240> defense<00:05:50.220> later<00:05:51.220> on<00:05:51.400> in<00:05:51.520> the

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580
