millimeter I think it's the perfect size
for<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:35.880> wrist<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.720> obviously<00:03:37.470> different

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
for my wrist but obviously different

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.039 
for my wrist but obviously different
people<00:03:38.670> will<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:39.000> getting<00:03:39.180> different<00:03:39.450> sizes
