focused<00:00:55.629> on<00:00:55.750> in<00:00:55.870> particular<00:00:55.960> were<00:00:56.770> issues

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
focused on in particular were issues

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.720 
focused on in particular were issues
around<00:00:57.850> poverty<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.840> discrimination

important barriers for many people to
access<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:07.000> health<00:01:07.240> care<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.840> also<00:01:08.140> access<00:01:08.590> to

access to health care and also access to

access to health care and also access to
the<00:01:09.340> underlying<00:01:09.700> determinants<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.780> health

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the underlying determinants of health

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700 
the underlying determinants of health
but<00:01:12.700> what<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:12.880> also<00:01:13.390> tried<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.810> do<00:01:14.049> was<00:01:14.350> cast

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
but what I also tried to do was cast

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.429 
but what I also tried to do was cast
around<00:01:14.979> four<00:01:15.430> specific<00:01:15.729> issues<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:17.110> would

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
around four specific issues that would

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.130 
around four specific issues that would
resonate<00:01:17.799> with<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:19.030> public<00:01:19.180> with<00:01:19.900> lawyers

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
resonate with the public with lawyers

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.800 
resonate with the public with lawyers
and<00:01:20.470> with<00:01:21.070> health<00:01:21.280> workers<00:01:21.790> I<00:01:22.000> took<00:01:22.270> advice<00:01:22.540> on

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
and with health workers I took advice on

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.600 
and with health workers I took advice on
what<00:01:22.930> they<00:01:23.080> might<00:01:23.320> be<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:24.340> think<00:01:24.520> I

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
what they might be and I think I

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
what they might be and I think I
probably<00:01:24.820> had<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.270> couple<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.689> false<00:01:25.930> starts

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
probably had a couple of false starts

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.690 
probably had a couple of false starts
but<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.460> end<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:28.200> did<00:01:29.430> identify<00:01:30.430> one

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
but in the end I did identify one

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.640 
but in the end I did identify one
particular<00:01:30.970> issue<00:01:31.330> which<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.869> think<00:01:32.170> has

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
particular issue which I think has

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.429 
particular issue which I think has
proved<00:01:33.060> epicyte<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.780> was<00:01:34.930> looking<00:01:35.290> at

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
proved epicyte and that was looking at

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.070 
proved epicyte and that was looking at
maternal<00:01:36.340> mortality<00:01:36.549> in<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.630> human<00:01:37.900> rights

maternal mortality in a human rights

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
context I remember I I had to report to

was really keen to look at because it's

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.729 
was really keen to look at because it's
often<00:02:51.389> neglected<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.019> least<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.470> human

I stick my neck out I think it's the

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.719 
I stick my neck out I think it's the
issue<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> next<00:03:25.859> sort<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.129> three<00:03:26.370> or<00:03:26.489> four

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729

so<00:03:31.109> we've<00:03:31.709> now<00:03:31.949> made<00:03:32.159> some<00:03:32.400> progress<00:03:32.689> framing

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
so we've now made some progress framing

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.750 
so we've now made some progress framing
and<00:03:33.810> understanding<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.010> tournament<00:03:35.400> al-aziz

all<00:04:00.389> of<00:04:00.449> those<00:04:00.720> deaths<00:04:01.049> constitute<00:04:01.919> a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
all of those deaths constitute a

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.649 
all of those deaths constitute a
violation<00:04:02.189> of<00:04:02.699> human<00:04:02.970> rights<00:04:03.000> obligation

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
violation of human rights obligation

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.330 
violation of human rights obligation
that<00:04:03.689> would<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:04.019> too<00:04:04.199> simplistic<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:05.280> I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
that would be too simplistic but I

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.699 
that would be too simplistic but I
suspect<00:04:05.639> quite<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> few<00:04:06.419> of<00:04:06.509> them<00:04:06.659> do<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.500> more

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
suspect quite a few of them do but more

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.920 
suspect quite a few of them do but more
importantly<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.519> we<00:04:08.579> apply<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> human<00:04:09.720> rights

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
importantly if we apply a human rights

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.439 
importantly if we apply a human rights
lens<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.250> problem<00:04:11.609> I<00:04:11.939> think<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.359> will

lens to that problem I think it will

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.110 
lens to that problem I think it will

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
help us identify what has to be done and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.110
