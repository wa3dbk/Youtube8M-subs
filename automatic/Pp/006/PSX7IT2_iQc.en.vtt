00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
that was getting too close and the

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.330 
that was getting too close and the
mother<00:01:34.479> came<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.689> don't<00:01:35.380> like<00:01:35.740> with<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.950> humans

you<00:01:36.400> idiot<00:01:36.759> this<00:01:37.570> plastic<00:01:38.049> here

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
you idiot this plastic here

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.730 
you idiot this plastic here
is<00:01:39.009> in<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.219> process<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.969> total<00:01:40.299> degradation

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
is in the process of total degradation

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.279 
is in the process of total degradation
so<00:01:41.740> what<00:01:41.859> it<00:01:41.950> means<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.609> UV<00:01:43.000> light

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
so what it means is the UV light

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.209 
so what it means is the UV light
basically<00:01:44.289> starts<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.770> make<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.009> really

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
basically starts to make it really

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.950 
basically starts to make it really
brittle<00:01:45.549> so<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.119> see<00:01:46.240> how<00:01:46.390> brittle<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.840> is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
brittle so you see how brittle that is

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.569 
brittle so you see how brittle that is
well<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.259> breaks<00:01:47.500> it's<00:01:47.799> almost<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.250> just<00:01:48.399> falls

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
well it breaks it's almost it just falls

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.039 
well it breaks it's almost it just falls
apart<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.939> can<00:01:49.149> break<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.479> over<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.840> over<00:01:49.990> and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
apart you can break it over and over and

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.779 
apart you can break it over and over and
over<00:01:50.110> again<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.649> these<00:01:51.189> basically<00:01:51.549> what

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
over again and these basically what

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.630 
over again and these basically what
happens<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.149> as<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.390> goes<00:01:52.750> down<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:54.340> ends<00:01:54.579> up

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
happens is as it goes down it ends up

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.249 
happens is as it goes down it ends up
doing<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.869> gets<00:01:56.020> into<00:01:56.170> these

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
doing this and it gets into these

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.350 
doing this and it gets into these
molecular<00:01:56.890> size<00:01:57.100> pieces<00:01:57.369> really<00:01:58.030> really

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
molecular size pieces really really

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.630 
molecular size pieces really really
really<00:01:58.539> tiny<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.860> most<00:02:00.069> of<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.219> plastic<00:02:00.549> in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
really tiny so most of the plastic in

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.550 
really tiny so most of the plastic in
our<00:02:00.700> ocean<00:02:00.969> is<00:02:01.060> no<00:02:01.299> bigger<00:02:01.569> than<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.929> and<00:02:02.229> it

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
our ocean is no bigger than that and it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.289 
our ocean is no bigger than that and it
just<00:02:02.590> breaks<00:02:02.920> down<00:02:03.069> that's<00:02:03.369> plastic<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.179> it's

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
just breaks down that's plastic so it's

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.429 
just breaks down that's plastic so it's
not<00:02:04.420> disappearing<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.110> just<00:02:05.229> getting

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
not disappearing it's just getting

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.109 
not disappearing it's just getting
smaller<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.979> that's<00:02:06.219> being<00:02:06.459> absorbed<00:02:06.819> in<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
smaller and that's being absorbed in the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.289 
smaller and that's being absorbed in the
food<00:02:07.299> chain<00:02:07.329> all<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.899> see<00:02:08.019> how<00:02:08.140> small<00:02:08.410> down

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
food chain all you see how small down

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.520 
food chain all you see how small down
and<00:02:10.299> that<00:02:10.450> just<00:02:10.660> ends<00:02:10.929> up<00:02:11.049> there<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.260> mean<00:02:11.440> this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and that just ends up there I mean this

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.370 
and that just ends up there I mean this
washed<00:02:11.829> up<00:02:12.010> today<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.750> think<00:02:13.750> about<00:02:13.900> keep<00:02:14.110> going

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
washed up today I think about keep going

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.690 
washed up today I think about keep going
with<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.590> premise<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.340> then<00:02:15.459> about<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
with this premise and then about a

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.640 
with this premise and then about a
thousand<00:02:16.180> years<00:02:16.329> from<00:02:16.390> now<00:02:16.510> welcome<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
thousand years from now welcome to the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.920 
thousand years from now welcome to the
great<00:02:17.890> plastic<00:02:18.489> seat<00:02:18.760> yeah<00:02:19.120> our<00:02:19.480> people<00:02:19.810> out

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
great plastic seat yeah our people out

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.240 
great plastic seat yeah our people out
there<00:02:20.140> who<00:02:20.260> say<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.530> know<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:21.010> doesn't

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
there who say you know this doesn't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.949 
there who say you know this doesn't
exist<00:02:21.549> we're<00:02:21.790> not<00:02:21.910> ruining<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.299> planet<00:02:22.720> you

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
exist we're not ruining our planet you

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.460 
exist we're not ruining our planet you
know<00:02:23.079> look<00:02:23.590> at<00:02:23.650> Mars<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> failed<00:02:24.819> system

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
know look at Mars it was a failed system

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.110 
know look at Mars it was a failed system
they<00:02:26.470> said<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:26.890> had<00:02:27.040> water<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.670> still<00:02:27.940> has

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
they said it had water and it still has

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.910 
they said it had water and it still has
polar<00:02:28.329> ice<00:02:28.540> caps<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.079> you<00:02:29.170> realize<00:02:29.440> for

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
polar ice caps but you realize for

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.030 
polar ice caps but you realize for
whatever<00:02:30.130> reason<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.209> didn't<00:02:31.540> take<00:02:31.810> if<00:02:32.769> there

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
whatever reason it didn't take if there

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.890 
whatever reason it didn't take if there
was<00:02:33.220> water<00:02:33.519> there<00:02:33.670> wasn't<00:02:34.269> evidence<00:02:34.810> of

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
was water there wasn't evidence of

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
was water there wasn't evidence of
rivers<00:02:35.170> flowing<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.890> annoying<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.489> then<00:02:36.670> for

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
rivers flowing and annoying and then for

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.250 
rivers flowing and annoying and then for
whatever<00:02:37.060> reason<00:02:37.180> they<00:02:37.390> lost<00:02:37.629> it<00:02:37.870> if<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
whatever reason they lost it if the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.199 
whatever reason they lost it if the
gravitational<00:02:38.620> field<00:02:38.980> shifted<00:02:39.489> maybe<00:02:40.120> a

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
gravitational field shifted maybe a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.349 
gravitational field shifted maybe a
massive<00:02:40.599> comet<00:02:41.099> something<00:02:42.099> happened<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.610> pop

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
massive comet something happened and pop

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.509 
massive comet something happened and pop
I<00:02:43.480> came<00:02:43.870> over<00:02:44.139> thank<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.250> won't<00:02:45.459> be

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
personal and the idea of messing with it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.809 
personal and the idea of messing with it
in<00:02:58.870> any<00:02:58.989> way<00:02:59.200> when<00:02:59.859> you<00:02:59.980> realize<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.670> can

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
in any way when you realize if you can

in any way when you realize if you can
take<00:03:01.000> care<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.420> if<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.049> if<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.980> take<00:03:03.190> care

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
take care of it if you if you take care

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.789 
take care of it if you if you take care
of<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:03.910> heals<00:03:04.239> pretty<00:03:04.510> quickly<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.079> just

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
of it it heals pretty quickly I just

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.740 
of it it heals pretty quickly I just
think<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.340> idea<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.910> some<00:03:07.329> sort<00:03:07.630> of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
think that the idea of some sort of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.280 
think that the idea of some sort of
evolutionary<00:03:08.319> thing<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:09.130> know<00:03:09.250> going<00:03:10.290> and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
evolutionary thing of you know going and

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.830 
evolutionary thing of you know going and
realizing<00:03:11.980> being<00:03:12.310> curious<00:03:12.519> curious<00:03:13.359> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
realizing being curious curious and

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
curious and pursuing your curiosity not

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:16.220 
curious and pursuing your curiosity not
just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
just

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
oh maybe physically know what what makes

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.270 
oh maybe physically know what what makes
that<00:03:18.870> work<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.200> how<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.800> fix<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:25.440> do<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280
