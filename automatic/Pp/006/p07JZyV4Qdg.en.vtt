what<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.039> happened<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.899> and<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.680> are

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
what just happened right here and we are

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
what just happened right here and we are
lagging<00:00:50.160> okay<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.000> he<00:00:51.780> said<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> King<00:00:52.320> harder

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

to<00:00:53.520> finish<00:00:53.789> kingship<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.870> honestly<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
to finish kingship which honestly I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.639 
to finish kingship which honestly I
think<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.160> better<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.730> it's

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
think that would be better because it's

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
think that would be better because it's
it<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.920> pretty<00:00:59.190> easy<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> don't

know<00:02:15.209> if<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.660> glitch<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.260> bug<00:02:16.530> where<00:02:17.160> you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
know if it's a glitch or a bug where you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.370 
know if it's a glitch or a bug where you
just<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.300> could<00:02:18.450> try<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.110> trade

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
just you could try it you could trade

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.350 
just you could try it you could trade

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
ask for bread and you close the thing

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.320 
ask for bread and you close the thing

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.020 
and reopen it to get more bread and work
every<00:02:24.720> time<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.010> that's<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:26.610> something

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
every time so that's that's something

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.740 
every time so that's that's something
new<00:02:27.270> he<00:02:28.080> also<00:02:28.230> said<00:02:28.620> ah<00:02:29.420> there's<00:02:30.420> different

types of kingdoms that he's going to add

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.860 
types of kingdoms that he's going to add
and<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:35.190> might<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.400> able<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.180> invade<00:02:36.690> other

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.559 
and you might be able to invade other
kingdoms<00:02:37.440> which<00:02:38.100> sounds<00:02:38.459> really<00:02:38.489> fun<00:02:39.270> and

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
kingdoms which sounds really fun and

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.120 
kingdoms which sounds really fun and
interesting<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.470> make<00:02:40.620> mod<00:02:41.030> even<00:02:42.030> better<00:02:42.239> and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
interesting to make mod even better and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.860 
interesting to make mod even better and
obviously<00:02:44.130> he<00:02:44.520> said<00:02:44.970> there's<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
obviously he said there's going to be a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.290 
obviously he said there's going to be a
central<00:02:46.320> block<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.920> your<00:02:47.040> kingdom<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> can

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
central block in your kingdom so you can

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.140 
central block in your kingdom so you can
access<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.900> only<00:02:49.140> by<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:50.550> exactly<00:02:50.910> sure

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
access that only by you not exactly sure

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.060 
access that only by you not exactly sure
what<00:02:51.480> he<00:02:51.630> means<00:02:51.840> but<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.500> guess<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:52.920> like

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
what he means but I guess you can like

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.850 
what he means but I guess you can like
control<00:02:53.250> stuff<00:02:53.790> maybe<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.650> move

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
control stuff maybe you can like move

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.680 
control stuff maybe you can like move
around<00:02:56.160> buildings<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.000> stuff<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.330> mean<00:02:57.360> that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
around buildings and stuff I mean that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.290 
around buildings and stuff I mean that
would<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.050> cool<00:02:58.459> now<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.519> have<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
would be really cool now you have to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.320 
would be really cool now you have to
kill<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.350> lot<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.709> monsters<00:03:02.370> I'm<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:02.880> exactly

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
kill a lot of monsters I'm not exactly

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.440 
kill a lot of monsters I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:03.569> how<00:03:04.560> many<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.640> believe<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.239> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
sure how many but I believe you have to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.550 
sure how many but I believe you have to
get<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.690> level<00:03:06.900> 30<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.950> said<00:03:08.160> arm<00:03:09.560> but

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
get to level 30 is what it said arm but

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.040 
get to level 30 is what it said arm but
this<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> really<00:03:11.850> good<00:03:12.000> mod<00:03:12.209> now<00:03:12.569> I'm<00:03:12.870> gonna

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
this is a really good mod now I'm gonna

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.960 
this is a really good mod now I'm gonna
pull<00:03:13.260> out<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.560> Excalibur<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:16.579> secret

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.259 

it's<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.329> here<00:03:22.549> now<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:23.760> thing<00:03:24.000> looks

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
it's right here now this thing looks

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.069 
it's right here now this thing looks
really<00:03:24.989> amazing<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.370> love<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:27.180> think

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
really amazing and I love it I think

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.680 
really amazing and I love it I think
it's<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.320> little<00:03:28.590> bit<00:03:28.790> overpowered<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.180> that's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
it's a little bit overpowered but that's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.060 
it's a little bit overpowered but that's
just<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.019> opinion<00:03:31.489> see<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> can<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:32.970> BAM

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
just my opinion see I can just like BAM

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.199 
just my opinion see I can just like BAM
that<00:03:35.070> guy's<00:03:35.250> dead<00:03:35.600> arm<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.820> go<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
that guy's dead arm so if we go to a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.110 
that guy's dead arm so if we go to a
different<00:03:39.570> view<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:41.000> there's<00:03:42.000> a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
different view you can see there's a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.979 
different view you can see there's a
Excalibur<00:03:42.989> looks<00:03:43.410> really<00:03:43.859> cool<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.810> love<00:03:45.810> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
Excalibur looks really cool I love it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.349 
Excalibur looks really cool I love it
it's<00:03:46.170> amazing<00:03:46.470> hits<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.579> hundreds<00:03:48.060> I

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
it's amazing hits like for hundreds I

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.020 
it's amazing hits like for hundreds I
think<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.590> should<00:03:49.799> be<00:03:49.859> hitting<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:50.400> maybe<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
think it should be hitting like maybe a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.360 
think it should be hitting like maybe a
hundred<00:03:51.299> two<00:03:51.780> hundred<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:53.070> think<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
hundred two hundred and I think the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.920 
hundred two hundred and I think the
pricing<00:03:53.790> should<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> little<00:03:54.570> bit<00:03:54.720> higher

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
pricing should be a little bit higher

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.740 
pricing should be a little bit higher
but<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.040> my<00:03:56.549> thinking<00:03:56.880> but<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.510> just

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
but this is just my thinking but I just

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.229 
but this is just my thinking but I just
want<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.959> say<00:03:58.140> i<00:03:58.170> love<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.799> mod<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.579> i<00:03:59.970> can't

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
want to say i love this mod and i can't

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.229 
want to say i love this mod and i can't
wait<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.570> see<00:04:00.750> future<00:04:00.930> updates<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.239> i'm

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
wait to see future updates of it and i'm

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.840 
wait to see future updates of it and i'm
not<00:04:03.269> exactly<00:04:03.690> sure<00:04:03.870> there's<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.920> bank<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.579> was

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
not exactly sure there's a bank that was

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.780 
not exactly sure there's a bank that was
in<00:04:06.000> here<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.290> first<00:04:07.500> tale<00:04:07.950> kingdoms<00:04:08.430> but

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
in here in the first tale kingdoms but

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.690 
in here in the first tale kingdoms but
the<00:04:09.030> banker<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.720> obviously<00:04:10.230> not<00:04:10.470> here<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.459> I'm

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the banker is obviously not here so I'm

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.509 
the banker is obviously not here so I'm
not<00:04:12.030> sure<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:13.019> just<00:04:13.290> not<00:04:13.739> coated<00:04:13.980> right<00:04:14.280> or

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
not sure that's just not coated right or

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.050 
not sure that's just not coated right or
whatever<00:04:14.840> but<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.950> wish<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.130> see<00:04:17.340> more<00:04:17.640> updates

whatever but I wish to see more updates
in<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.780> future<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:20.840> maybe<00:04:21.840> we'll<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.409> a<00:04:22.440> let's

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
in the future and maybe we'll do a let's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.390 
in the future and maybe we'll do a let's
let's<00:04:23.789> play<00:04:24.000> survival<00:04:24.720> with<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.650> mod
