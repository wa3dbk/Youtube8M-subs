00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.040 
the next step is to take the plastic
wrap<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:45.850> we're<00:02:46.850> going<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.120> wrap<00:02:47.420> each<00:02:47.690> one<00:02:47.960> of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
wrap and we're going to wrap each one of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:59.160 
wrap and we're going to wrap each one of
these<00:02:48.140> up<00:02:48.320> individually<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.370> plastic<00:02:49.910> wrap

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.420 

I'm<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:00.380> going<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> set<00:03:00.740> this<00:03:00.860> aside<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
I'm just going to set this aside and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.310 
I'm just going to set this aside and
continue<00:03:01.520> with<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:01.940> rest<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.300> them<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:06.260> is

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
continue with the rest of them this is

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.120 
continue with the rest of them this is
the<00:03:06.560> last<00:03:06.800> one<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.320> long<00:03:12.530> wrap<00:03:12.800> and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
the last one so I have a long wrap and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.590

to<00:03:54.980> start<00:03:55.160> in<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> middle<00:03:55.370> I'm<00:03:55.580> just<00:03:55.790> going<00:03:56.000> to

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
to start in the middle I'm just going to

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.610 
to start in the middle I'm just going to
start<00:03:57.190> cutting<00:03:58.190> them<00:03:59.290> trying<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.410> get<00:04:00.530> them

and using a serenaded serrated knife

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:24.159 
and using a serenaded serrated knife
really<00:04:15.980> helps<00:04:16.430> cut<00:04:17.060> through<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:23.110> okay<00:04:24.110> so
