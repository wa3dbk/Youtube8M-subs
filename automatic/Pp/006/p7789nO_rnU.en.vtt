really<00:00:14.219> only<00:00:14.370> works<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.730> creative<00:00:15.240> mode<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
really only works for creative mode I

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.670 
really only works for creative mode I
mean<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> could<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.199> survival<00:00:16.650> mode

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
mean you could do this in survival mode

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.230 
mean you could do this in survival mode
but<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.190> won't<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.640> infinite<00:00:18.000> amount<00:00:18.029> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
but you won't get an infinite amount of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
but you won't get an infinite amount of
eggs<00:00:18.359> because<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.170> survival<00:00:19.680> mode<00:00:19.830> what

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
eggs because it is survival mode what

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.580 
eggs because it is survival mode what

you're going to need to do is I'm put
two<00:00:22.769> blocks<00:00:23.010> either<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> right<00:00:23.730> or<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
two blocks either to the right or to the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.380 
two blocks either to the right or to the
left<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.410> any<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.800> actually

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
left of it it can be any way actually

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
left of it it can be any way actually
this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.570> simple<00:00:28.019> tutorial<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
this is a very simple tutorial it's a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.620 
this is a very simple tutorial it's a
piston<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.849> there's<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> lot<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.390> other

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
piston way I know there's a lot of other

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.860 
piston way I know there's a lot of other
people<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.560> done<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> before<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.870> but

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
people that have done it before and but

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.900 
people that have done it before and but
people<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.469> join<00:00:34.680> my<00:00:34.770> server<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.489> most<00:00:35.790> of

people that join my server not most of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
people that join my server not most of
them<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.149> clueless<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.960> comes<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
them are clueless when it comes to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.959 
them are clueless when it comes to
getting<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> dragon<00:00:37.920> egg<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.850> we're

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
getting the dragon egg off so we're

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.310 
getting the dragon egg off so we're
going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.390> you're<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:40.079> seize

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
going to do is you're going to up seize

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
going to do is you're going to up seize
hold<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:40.860> you're<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
hold on here you're going to put a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.510 
hold on here you're going to put a
piston<00:00:42.210> facing<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.260> Enderdragon<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.370> way

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
piston facing the Enderdragon one way

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
piston facing the Enderdragon one way
you're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> put<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> block<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.379> below

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you're going to put a block right below

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
you're going to put a block right below
it<00:00:46.739> whichever<00:00:47.129> way<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.550> doing<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.059> it's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
it whichever way you're doing it so it's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
it whichever way you're doing it so it's
going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> look<00:00:48.750> something<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> you're

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
going to look something like this you're

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.410 
going to look something like this you're
going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> push<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
going to push it off and it's going to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
going to push it off and it's going to
fall<00:00:51.660> off<00:00:51.690> usually<00:00:52.350> hit<00:00:52.649> somewhere<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
fall off usually hit somewhere there and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
fall off usually hit somewhere there and
if<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> doesn't<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.539> break<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
if it doesn't you can just break the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
if it doesn't you can just break the
portal<00:00:55.520> get<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.300> did<00:00:57.360> over<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
portal get it like I did over there to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540 
portal get it like I did over there to
the<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> dragon

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the right and now you have the dragon

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
the right and now you have the dragon
egg<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> your<00:00:59.940> inventory<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.170> back

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
egg and your inventory there you go back

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.139 
egg and your inventory there you go back
into<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.280> main<00:01:02.520> world<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.000> can

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
into the you know main world and you can

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.609 
into the you know main world and you can
place<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> down<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.750> many<00:01:03.930> times<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> want

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
place it down as many times as you want

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
place it down as many times as you want
however<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.400> cannot<00:01:05.640> break<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.840> cannot

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
however you cannot break it you cannot

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
however you cannot break it you cannot
pick<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> back<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.950> once<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> put<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> down

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
pick it back up so once you put it down

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
pick it back up so once you put it down
unless<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> permanently<00:01:09.780> break<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
unless you want to permanently break it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
unless you want to permanently break it
it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> go<00:01:11.280> anywhere<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.060> that's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's not going to go anywhere so that's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
it's not going to go anywhere so that's
why<00:01:12.619> I'm<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.860> only<00:01:13.979> person<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.430> has<00:01:14.460> in

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
why I'm the only person that has in

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160 
why I'm the only person that has in
their<00:01:14.880> inventory<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.540> mean<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> could<00:01:15.960> press

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
their inventory I mean you could press

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
their inventory I mean you could press
beyond<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.250> might<00:01:17.460> work<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.820> well<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.659> um

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
beyond it that might work as well but um

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.480 
beyond it that might work as well but um

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you just want to be very careful because

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
you just want to be very careful because
it's<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> kind
