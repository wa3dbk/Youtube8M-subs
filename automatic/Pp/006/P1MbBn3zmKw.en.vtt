00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
a treadle so as you can see i'm actually

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.660 
a treadle so as you can see i'm actually
in<00:00:18.960> my<00:00:19.109> survival<00:00:19.619> world<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.130> we're<00:00:20.520> actually

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
in my survival world and we're actually

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.420 
in my survival world and we're actually
on<00:00:20.880> top<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> never<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.199> amuses<00:00:22.710> strange

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
on top of the never it amuses strange

on top of the never it amuses strange
game<00:00:23.730> mechanic<00:00:24.300> which<00:00:24.510> may<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:24.869> patched<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
game mechanic which may be patched in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.370 
game mechanic which may be patched in
later<00:00:25.710> updates<00:00:26.510> because<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.750> no<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.140> doesn't

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
later updates because it no it doesn't

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.740 
later updates because it no it doesn't
really<00:00:28.470> make<00:00:28.680> any<00:00:28.740> sense<00:00:29.279> whatsoever

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
really make any sense whatsoever

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.150 
really make any sense whatsoever
basically<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.019> tree<00:00:31.320> roots<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> dark<00:00:31.980> oak

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
basically you tree roots of a dark oak

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
basically you tree roots of a dark oak
tree<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> bunch<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> holes<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.420> whenever

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
tree to a bunch of holes and whenever

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.850 
tree to a bunch of holes and whenever
for<00:00:34.200> whatever<00:00:34.469> reason<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.530> yeah<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.590> can

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
for whatever reason so yeah you can

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310 
for whatever reason so yeah you can
create<00:00:38.160> gold<00:00:38.520> farms<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> thought<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
create gold farms like when I thought I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.790 
create gold farms like when I thought I
render<00:00:40.710> distance<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> bit<00:00:41.309> longer<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
render distance was a bit longer and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.500 
render distance was a bit longer and
yeah<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> daily

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.170 
just got an axe i can destroy the root
and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> need<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.130> ladder<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.670> however

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and then you need one ladder and however

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.609 
and then you need one ladder and however
many<00:01:36.299> end<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.560> take

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
many end up on you think that will take

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
many end up on you think that will take
you<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> first<00:01:39.630> step<00:01:39.869> i'm<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you to do this first step i'm going to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
you to do this first step i'm going to
try<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.009> first<00:01:41.460> off<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
try so first off what you want to do is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.340 
try so first off what you want to do is
you<00:01:42.360> want<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.600> find<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.079> block<00:01:43.409> where<00:01:44.659> your<00:01:45.659> head

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you want to find a block where your head

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.710 
you want to find a block where your head
for<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.710> 125<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.119> only<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
for this bit is 125 so and so only this

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.560 
for this bit is 125 so and so only this
block<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.320> floor<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.399> level<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
block be the floor of the level so then

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
block be the floor of the level so then
what<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.009> floor<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> top

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
what you want to do the floor of the top

dirt and then use dark oak saplings and
you<00:02:23.940> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> grow<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.450> then<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.070> want<00:02:26.220> to

get rid of the blocks underneath place
for<00:02:30.690> saplings<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:31.770> we'll<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.010> is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
for saplings and then what we'll do is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.170 
for saplings and then what we'll do is
we'll<00:02:32.370> continue<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.940> process<00:02:33.180> until

something it should happen soon addendum
I<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.780> annoyingly<00:02:40.490> something<00:02:41.490> where<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
I is annoyingly something where it

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.820 
I is annoyingly something where it
begins<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.690> Jackies<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.620> getting

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
begins to Jackies you see it's getting

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.260 
begins to Jackies you see it's getting
bulkier<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:45.120> keep<00:02:45.300> rolling<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:47.270> this

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
bulkier as we keep rolling it so this

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.840 
bulkier as we keep rolling it so this
will<00:02:48.420> maybe<00:02:48.600> yes<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.740> have<00:02:49.860> created<00:02:50.130> roots

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
will maybe yes we have created roots

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.230 
will maybe yes we have created roots
like<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.900> bottom<00:02:52.230> tree<00:02:52.560> makes<00:02:53.040> no<00:02:53.220> sense<00:02:53.520> then

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
like a bottom tree makes no sense then

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.370 
like a bottom tree makes no sense then
what<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.420> want<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> do<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.020> just<00:02:55.110> gonna
