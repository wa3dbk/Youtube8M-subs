in<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.880> video<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.540> compression<00:01:40.159> but

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
in this video because of compression but

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
in this video because of compression but
the<00:01:41.280> other<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.820> did<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the other thing that we did just to just

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
the other thing that we did just to just
for<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> sake<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> comparison<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.430> tried

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
for the sake of comparison was we tried

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
for the sake of comparison was we tried
to<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.720> Canon<00:01:46.079> DSLR<00:01:46.880> 6<00:01:47.880> &amp;<00:01:48.000> 8<00:01:48.060> D<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.500> we

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to take the Canon DSLR 6 &amp; 8 D and we

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.760 
to take the Canon DSLR 6 &amp; 8 D and we
try<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> pair<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.270> quality<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
try to pair the quality of that with the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
try to pair the quality of that with the
power<00:01:53.159> shot<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> excess<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
power shot and the excess just for the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.020 
power shot and the excess just for the
sake<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.720> comparison<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.409> course<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> DSLR<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
sake of comparison of course the DSLR is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
sake of comparison of course the DSLR is
a<00:01:57.060> much<00:01:57.270> more<00:01:57.450> robust<00:01:57.750> camera<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:59.219> most

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
a much more robust camera and in most

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.370 
a much more robust camera and in most
conditions<00:01:59.820> itself<00:02:00.450> Beach<00:02:00.689> both<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> these

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
conditions itself Beach both of these

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.740 
conditions itself Beach both of these
cameras<00:02:01.740> completely<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.570> some

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
cameras completely but there was some

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.539 
cameras completely but there was some
surprising<00:02:04.200> results<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.680> low<00:02:05.159> light<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
surprising results in low light and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.419 
surprising results in low light and
which<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.719> which<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.009> cameras<00:02:08.310> had

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
which in which one of these cameras had

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.720 
which in which one of these cameras had
an<00:02:08.520> edge<00:02:08.700> over<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.929> DSLR<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:11.610> more

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
an edge over the DSLR and for more

article that we have on our website on
my<00:02:17.670> comm<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.990> overall<00:02:19.350> both<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.740> these

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
my comm but overall both of these

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.350 
my comm but overall both of these
cameras<00:02:20.160> are<00:02:20.310> pretty<00:02:20.520> cool<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:20.910> Adam<00:02:21.240> did

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
cameras are pretty cool I think Adam did

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.730 
cameras are pretty cool I think Adam did
a<00:02:21.420> great<00:02:21.600> job<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.990> both<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.260> these<00:02:22.350> cameras

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
a great job with both of these cameras

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.990 
a great job with both of these cameras
and<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:24.209> mean<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.430> power<00:02:26.430> shot<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.819> what's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and I mean the power shot is what's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.480 
and I mean the power shot is what's
something<00:02:27.620> someone<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.740> buy<00:02:28.890> who<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.220> being

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
something someone would buy who is being

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.160 
something someone would buy who is being
most<00:02:29.640> used<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.300> DSLR<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:30.780> doesn't<00:02:30.990> want<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
most used to DSLR but doesn't want to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320 
most used to DSLR but doesn't want to
buy<00:02:31.290> DSLR<00:02:31.740> again<00:02:31.950> because<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.910> quality<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
buy DSLR again because the quality of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.250 
buy DSLR again because the quality of
this<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.540> excellent<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:35.010> has<00:02:35.190> an<00:02:35.400> amazing<00:02:35.700> zoom

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
this is excellent it has an amazing zoom

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.710 
this is excellent it has an amazing zoom
20x<00:02:37.260> zoom<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.550> uses<00:02:38.730> digit<00:02:39.090> 5<00:02:39.239> processor

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
20x zoom and it uses digit 5 processor

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.930 
20x zoom and it uses digit 5 processor
and<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:41.190> has<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> number<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.670> different

and it has a number of different
features<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.330> has<00:02:42.420> very<00:02:42.600> smart<00:02:42.959> image

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
features it has very smart image

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.199 
features it has very smart image
stabilization<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.550> even<00:02:44.760> when<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.060> zoom

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
stabilization in it even when you zoom

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.460 
stabilization in it even when you zoom
all<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.420> way<00:02:45.540> through<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.989> actually<00:02:46.170> does

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
all the way through it actually does

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.140 
all the way through it actually does
very<00:02:46.770> good<00:02:46.980> job<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.370> stabilizing<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.970> image

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
very good job in stabilizing the image

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.710 
very good job in stabilizing the image
that<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.870> has<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.260> records<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.680> full<00:02:49.890> 1080p<00:02:50.720> it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
has the Calais propriety HS system which

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
has the Calais propriety HS system which
they<00:02:54.150> claim<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.950> does<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.130> much<00:02:56.310> better<00:02:56.340> job<00:02:56.930> in

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
they claim is does a much better job in

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.720 
they claim is does a much better job in
terms<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.260> image<00:02:58.470> quality<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.980> other<00:02:59.280> cameras

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
terms of image quality and other cameras

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.050 
terms of image quality and other cameras
in<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.880> market<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:02.100> yeah<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.820> power

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
in the market and and yeah so the power

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.840 
in the market and and yeah so the power
shot<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.450> what<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.690> would<00:03:03.930> say<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:05.580> one<00:03:05.730> is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
shot is what I would say is this one is

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.759 
shot is what I would say is this one is
a<00:03:05.880> very<00:03:05.970> robust<00:03:06.390> model<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.470> actually

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
a very robust model that that actually

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.080 
a very robust model that that actually
does<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> lot<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.150> cool<00:03:09.150> photography<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:11.090> most

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
does a lot of cool photography and most

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
does a lot of cool photography and most
people<00:03:12.330> who<00:03:12.390> buy<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.600> XS<00:03:13.080> however<00:03:13.410> is

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
people who buy the XS however is

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.690 
people who buy the XS however is
something<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.070> sort<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> pales<00:03:14.580> in

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
something that sort of pales in

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.270 
something that sort of pales in
comparison<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:15.360> terms<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.930> image<00:03:16.080> quality

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
comparison in terms of image quality

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.370 
comparison in terms of image quality
because<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:17.970> focus<00:03:18.269> more<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
because I think can it focus more on the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.319 
because I think can it focus more on the
looks<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.860> being<00:03:20.489> more<00:03:20.640> mainstream<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.180> more

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
looks and being more mainstream and more

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.020 
looks and being more mainstream and more
appealing<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.989> 3<00:03:22.530> mass<00:03:22.850> audiences<00:03:23.850> with

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
appealing to the 3 mass audiences with

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.220 
appealing to the 3 mass audiences with
this<00:03:24.150> camera<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.570> think<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:25.049> I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
this camera and I think that what I

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.560

think it looks something that that

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.819 
think it looks something that that
anyone<00:03:27.900> would<00:03:28.049> pick<00:03:28.260> up<00:03:28.380> from<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> store

anyone would pick up from the store

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.370 
anyone would pick up from the store
because<00:03:29.340> looks<00:03:29.670> beautiful<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.239> but<00:03:31.049> don't<00:03:31.290> be

it carries a lot of amazing features in

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.220 
it carries a lot of amazing features in
itself<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.180> most<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> features<00:03:37.140> from

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
itself and most of the features from

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.229 
itself and most of the features from
this<00:03:37.410> carry<00:03:37.650> over<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.190> thing<00:03:38.579> as<00:03:39.090> well

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
this carry over to this thing as well

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.940 
this carry over to this thing as well
they<00:03:39.660> both<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.049> an<00:03:40.170> auto<00:03:40.350> function<00:03:40.769> which

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
they both have an auto function which

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.470 
they both have an auto function which
actually<00:03:41.670> has<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> number<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.209> different

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
actually has a number of different

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.449 
actually has a number of different
scenes<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.989> can<00:03:43.140> select<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.430> will

scenes that you can select that it will

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.400 
scenes that you can select that it will
select<00:03:44.790> automatically<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.900> think<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.260> is

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
select automatically and I think that is

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.900 
select automatically and I think that is
