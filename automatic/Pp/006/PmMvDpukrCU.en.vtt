00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.620
 Hi friends and welcome to all of you today 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 we're going to see how to do this 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 professional contour technique with 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 the rubber used for this background technique 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.480
 especially as you can see 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 in front of you when we maybe have a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.630
 beautiful landscape but the sky maybe it is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.180
 too flat and we would like to change it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 this technique helps us to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 going around in the shortest time 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.120
 possible especially area buildings I have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.610
 chose place to this tree because it has 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.500
 of the spaces in between so more 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.020
 complicated unlike trees that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.660
 they are full and therefore easier 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.510
 cut out to then change the background 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 maybe and make wallpapers that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 maybe you see so many times around 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.329
 strange astral type that still damage 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 that extra effect on photography for 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.700
 do you like 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.180
 you can also decide to put 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.490
 anyway a background anyway 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 even a sunset after you will be there 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.049
 choice 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 nothing will be important that we will go 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.939
 to transform as I told you before ea 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.060
 outlast this tree this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.189
 difficult contour and remove them all 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.770
 background so we come to us we go to 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:34.170
 see how it's done then first 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 you have to remove the padlock to the level of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 background 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 so we click ok and remove the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 padlock 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.670
 Second thing we're going to click on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.540
 our rubber by holding down we will go to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.180
 choose eraser tool for background 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.670
 of the second thing will be first 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.299
 leave those on the limits you have three 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 options 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.799
 we will go to the edge because the first one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.250
 phase will find the burgundy in our 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.250
 tree 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.259
 we leave a tolerance of 50 per 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 one hundred because we are interested in it for now 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.329
 this and protect plan to bring us color 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.170
 of first floor 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.450
 we're going to choose us in this case 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.640
 I had already done before so it is 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.200
 however the color will still be as good as 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.830
 see select it here and you will have the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.390
 color that pretty much he doesn't go to 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.459
 tap then select network 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.560
 practically the color of the branch is after 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.360
 clicking as you see him delete it 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.470
 background will come as you can see also 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 going over our tree but not 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.470
 will delete its interior but 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:54.739
 it will only look for you as you can see 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.739
 burgundy as I said at the beginning 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.840
 go as quietly as you can 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:05.400
 see here on these parts so much 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.780
 He once you find the that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.180
 talte light brown selected 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.660
 initially I will not go to cancel 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.150
 obviously don't go off anyway 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.459
 to the tree in this sense because 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.280
 however you risk touching one of the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.840
 branches and therefore also to cancel that 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.760
 as you can see so he went to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.310
 years already to find me all 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.150
 hour tree edges we have a 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.500
 problem, however, that practically is seen 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.120
 still the background inside our tree 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.180
 so how are we going to do it? 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.989
 the technique will enlarge our lens 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.970
 find borders here could be good 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.769
 but it would take us more because 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.750
 would select only practically the 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.220
 inside as I showed you 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.120
 first here in this sense 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.130
 so instead you'll have time to go 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.940
 to change to do much faster in 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.900
 not contiguous ie not continuous and maybe 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.569
 turn down this a little with tolerance 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.090
 will allow us to select the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.510
 area to make us also cancel the area 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.139
 like as you see outside the usual 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.780
 selection and nothing like you see the ICE 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.639
 will select to be very careful the only one 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.960
 what not to obviously go over 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.180
 the tree because otherwise as you can 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.340
 see it will delete it but if not 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.919
 would touch the tree so big 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.020
 fear the image as much as you want and you will go 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.760
 to select practically only the part 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.330
 blue 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 as you can see photoshop will delete 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.139
 just the background 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.370
 here is a bit of a break we say why 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.290
 should be there to select some 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.520
 all areas however as you can see 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.220
 of course also go outside him 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.440
 will only delete the blue part of the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.210
 our background this of course I have 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.889
 taken to a very intricate tree 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.380
 there are easier than you will be 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.490
 there then being no scontorna 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.600
 this is a tutorial 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.630
 obviously I have already done so from 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.970
 waste less time and don't stay here 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:21.780
 half an hour and then we will transform the tree 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:24.889
 the so practically has it as you can 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.340
 see we removed the whole area 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:32.910
 blue now remains alone 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.639
 practically all our branches now don't 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.780
 there remains that will add our fund 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.940
 as you can see I will also add a 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.870
 white level to make you notice that the 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.740
 contour was really good as 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:53.160
 you see the companies just about everybody 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.260
 your tree branches 1 outlines 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.110
 that you will never be able to deal with 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.370
 other methods and therefore simply 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.200
 this background we can also cut was 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.300
 just to show you I brought 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.770
 this background here then of course like 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.050
 I said before you can put a sunset 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.479
 what you want I brought from this 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:19.270
 part and voila we would have created 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.610
 a more suggestive image from a background 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.349
 dish that we all had at the beginning 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:29.110
 blue to this background a little strange 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:32.139
 anyway as I said before if you see 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.789
 these white areas is simply lo 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.240
 background that I put behind as you see 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.580
 if the move will be selected on 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.210
 the tree as you can see enough 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.550
 well and I will also tell you that I did it 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.949
 pretty fast this thing here nothing 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.949
 I hope that with this tutorial Russia will not 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.409
 it was helpful it will for sure be for 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.419
 who is used to photographing backgrounds 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.509
 maybe to some of my beautiful landscapes 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.430
 but at that moment the sky did not help 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:04.569
 and therefore thanks to this technique 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:07.740
 able to create his background a 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:11.199
 landscape as he likes it 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.580
 Well guys, I greet you and give you 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.159
 appointment to the next tutorial

 speedart that you know nothing 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:19.120
