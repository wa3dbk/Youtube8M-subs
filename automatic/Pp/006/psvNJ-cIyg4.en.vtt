00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.420
 we will do our battery of tests 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.910
 test them all we will put them 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.440
 in the head we're going to make a swell 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.610
 and they have interest in making the flame 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.540
 otherwise they go to fire 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.140
 all this beautiful little hardware store 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.730
 fire lighter kit 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.730
 it left my Kiki 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.860
 group in 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:46.039
 on the stuff that makes me laugh the most 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.739
 what's the point, tell me what's the point? 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.690
 You like it because something like that 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:58.339
 I do not know I'm completely 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:01.610
 dubious we have a fire-stone 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.799
 quote blocks we see it works well 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.149
 right now but I I I 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.850
 it may be the outfit they like 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.830
 I know this bit of juice is the tool that 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.860
 makes me bit is completely that 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.580
 walk makes the flame and what it takes 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.159
 but I tell myself that after a while 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 will evaluate the length I see not 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.130
 why have that to the extent that if 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.060
 it's actually sfio city â€‹â€‹like 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.759
 a very small diameter 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.500
 at that moment we use what we do not 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.380
 we at sea so not with this thing the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.880
 do not buy that I tell you 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.340
 buy pass to buy the others the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.600
 red bcb like that with the compass the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.969
 chewing in the other videos you 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.130

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:54.189
 ready with this thing I do not understand me 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.189

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.229

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.719

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.090
 that is that one that it lodges in those 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.489
 after a while it's not a problem and at 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.440
 After a while it comes off not 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.100

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.920
 nickel keychain

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:03.330
 beautiful fire-stone like that it's me 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.330
 I adopt here but stop it my god 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.660
 it ricochets on the water it can 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.740
 to be funny this is one of the pumps for 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.110
 make signals and either one has to 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.470
 cling name to a big joke apart 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.510
 I do not understand that we see a move 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.690
 firearm is one more among 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.880
 so many others at this end 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.800
 November was a little bigger for 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.150
 compete with it there is no need to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:32.290
 competition it stays there good go on 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:37.870
 laughter test the sheaf there for good 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:53.040
 it is to be stacked finally I think that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:53.040
 lightning I hear the daily thunder 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.620
 like the samurai proverb it's not 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.490
 at the size of the swords that one 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.060
 recognize the warrior 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.160
 yes the led screen but madness thought a 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.320
 tube bcb do not care about the horn a little 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.040
 long until then it works 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.170
 is safe 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.290
 it is not bad a good bouhdjar nothing to 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.290
