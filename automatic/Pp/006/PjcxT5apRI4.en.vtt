00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
cruel it was and then the time comes

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.390

collars on them and pull out all their
teeth<00:01:37.710> they're<00:01:38.369> too<00:01:38.549> dangerous<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.090> keep

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
teeth they're too dangerous to keep

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.010 
teeth they're too dangerous to keep
anymore<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> happen

anymore and so what is going to happen

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.130 
anymore and so what is going to happen
to<00:01:43.259> them<00:01:43.820> most<00:01:44.820> zoos<00:01:45.149> won't<00:01:45.659> take<00:01:45.899> them

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to them most zoos won't take them

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
to them most zoos won't take them
because<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> behave

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because they don't know how to behave

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.460 
because they don't know how to behave
like<00:01:48.060> chimps<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.750> fit<00:01:49.020> into<00:01:49.229> an
