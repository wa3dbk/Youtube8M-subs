shoot it downwards now what should
happen<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> gate<00:00:57.000> should<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.360> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
happen is that the gate should be in

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
happen is that the gate should be in
different<00:00:57.840> places<00:00:58.050> each<00:00:58.559> character<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.640> when

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
different places each character so when

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.670 
different places each character so when
you<00:00:59.940> both<00:01:00.149> shoot<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> gate<00:01:00.809> almost<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.559> an

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you both shoot the gate almost like an

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
you both shoot the gate almost like an
invisible<00:01:01.890> barrier<00:01:02.160> will<00:01:02.640> fly<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> fling

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
invisible barrier will fly up and fling

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
invisible barrier will fly up and fling
a<00:01:03.629> character<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> sky<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> may<00:01:05.280> take

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
a character into the sky now it may take

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.609 
a character into the sky now it may take
a<00:01:05.610> few<00:01:05.760> tries<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.409> tedious

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a few tries to do it's kind of tedious

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.770 
a few tries to do it's kind of tedious
but<00:01:08.010> eventually<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.790> gate<00:01:09.030> will<00:01:09.270> fling<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
but eventually the gate will fling you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
but eventually the gate will fling you
into<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.290> sky<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.430> right

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
into the sky and as you can see right

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
into the sky and as you can see right
now<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:12.119> character<00:01:12.600> has<00:01:12.630> gone<00:01:13.080> sky-high

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
now my character has gone sky-high

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399 
now my character has gone sky-high
almost<00:01:14.549> into<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> clouds<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> I'll<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
almost into the clouds and I'll and it
and<00:01:16.619> stand<00:01:17.280> back<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:17.970> even<00:01:18.060> die<00:01:18.299> so
