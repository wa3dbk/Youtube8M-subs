00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.019
 alfa romeo 4c big presentation 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.000
 style we do not approve only by day but 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.679
 even at night on board with a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.240
 tester who developed it here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.240
 on the toy track you come with me 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.420
 now we are at what we have already seen at 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.550
 world so fabrizio since how many years 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.180
 and that you work marco 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 really since 73 have entered the testing 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 I entered 80 arrive 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.870
 so let's say that 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 you ever have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.840
 to tell this new one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.410
 so 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.410
 in the person 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 I worked 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.719
 well 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719
 at the moment maybe 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.829
 sediments 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.700
 beyond 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.690
 well 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.290
 he was 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.290
 like at night again 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010
 the high beams 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.830
 for 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.400
 in predicting 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.400
 then passed I became an opinion 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.320
 I am operated 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.220
 also because this is how it cost a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.220
 phone to everything 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 practically 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.020
 there was some prototype maybe with the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.210
 manual change at the beginning right away 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.210
 now this change 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.170
 you see 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.480
 much of it has been done here on the track 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.480
 right 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.590
 watch me 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.590
 too much gas 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830
 then 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.180
 then later 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 digital that change 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.530
 levers behind the wheel 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.670
 it was maybe one 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.670
 on the fixed posts 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.510
 a bit 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.319
 no it is not 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.319
 the scene 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.989
 but yet 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.060
 in fact though 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.060
 I never take my hands off that much 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.620
 pleasure 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.719
 We expected 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.719
 I lost 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.960
 I was talking 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.350
 but other 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.500
 box 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.360
 we have to 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.510
 looks like a box to the structure that it was 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.449
 set up when representation 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.860
 they are gods 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.729
 to do in an action like I do 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:50.189
 see better as the alpha 4c at night 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:52.949
 with lights on and instrumentation ed 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.020
 here we are after the night tour with 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.569
 the alfa romeo 4c collaborator 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.719
 we are in a stand and beautiful 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.150
 purpose built to put in 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.939
 highlight the new creature of the alpha 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.889
 look at night the headlights are a lot 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.289
 details are a criticized element 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.249
 but let's at least give it an act of being 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.189
 spectacular 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.509
 in this capacity then we see this 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.249
 digital instrumentation we have 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.560
 seen only in the photo finally also at 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.439
 frankfurt salon the car turned off 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.569
 see the tool very small 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.749
 in front of the pilot the test driver 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.759
 fabrizio put it in race mode 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:32.399
 the graphics also change the color tomorrow 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.149
 we will see it moving very much indeed 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:35.149
 technological
