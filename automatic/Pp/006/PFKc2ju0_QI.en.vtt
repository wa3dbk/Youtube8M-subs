00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.280 
flip my hair back and forth after
letting<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.640> hair<00:01:59.850> down<00:01:59.910> I<00:02:00.360> realized<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.080> my

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
letting my hair down I realized that my

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.140 
letting my hair down I realized that my
natural<00:02:01.770> hair<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.400> extensions<00:02:02.970> were

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
natural hair and the extensions were

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.390 
natural hair and the extensions were
very<00:02:03.450> disconnected<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.530> usually<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
very disconnected I usually don't have

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.610 
very disconnected I usually don't have
this<00:02:05.670> problem<00:02:05.970> but<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.690> just<00:02:06.870> got<00:02:07.020> my<00:02:07.050> hair<00:02:07.380> cut

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
this problem but I just got my hair cut

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.169 
this problem but I just got my hair cut
so<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.190> lot<00:02:08.429> shorter<00:02:08.700> than<00:02:08.880> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so it's a lot shorter than the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.540 
so it's a lot shorter than the
extensions<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.710> I'm<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.070> do<00:02:11.280> is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
extensions so what I'm going to do is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.880 
extensions so what I'm going to do is
add<00:02:11.790> another<00:02:12.180> two<00:02:12.810> clip<00:02:13.110> weft<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> left

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
