don't have the six in foil we can fold
this<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.890> twice<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.730> we'll<00:01:14.910> start<00:01:15.210> over

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
this one twice so we'll start over

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.470 
this one twice so we'll start over
wait<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.490> six<00:01:17.880> tinfoil

because if you don't have this tin foil
so<00:01:21.540> grandma<00:01:21.870> doesn't<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.350> sick<00:01:22.590> tin<00:01:22.800> foil

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
so grandma doesn't have sick tin foil

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.180 
so grandma doesn't have sick tin foil
yeah<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.990> previous<00:01:25.380> presentation<00:01:26.010> was

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
yeah so the previous presentation was

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.420 
yeah so the previous presentation was
with<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> had<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.200> heavy-duty<00:01:28.680> tin<00:01:29.160> foil

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
with as if you had a heavy-duty tin foil

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.820 
with as if you had a heavy-duty tin foil
so<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:31.620> have

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
so now this is as if you don't have

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.630 
so now this is as if you don't have
heavy<00:01:32.070> -<00:01:32.340> tin<00:01:32.520> foil<00:01:32.760> right<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.470> C<00:01:34.830> so<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
heavy - tin foil right this is C so I

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.860 
heavy - tin foil right this is C so I
fold<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:38.670> want<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.630> fold

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
fold it in one and then I want to fold

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.530 
fold it in one and then I want to fold
it<00:01:40.080> again<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> probably<00:01:42.000> need<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.300> get<00:01:42.510> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it again so you probably need to get a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.670 
it again so you probably need to get a
bigger<00:01:42.840> peanut<00:01:43.170> oil

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
bigger peanut oil

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.000 
bigger peanut oil
all<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.550> there<00:01:44.820> no<00:01:45.030> okay<00:01:45.680> then<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.740> must

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
all right there no okay then I must

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.370
