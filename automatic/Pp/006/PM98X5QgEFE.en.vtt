has that puts it over the targets of my

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
opinion it incorporates the sleep awake

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.840 
opinion it incorporates the sleep awake
feature<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.770> targets<00:01:44.159> doesn't<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
feature so the targets doesn't do that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330

the way that this works you can of

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.100 
the way that this works you can of
course<00:03:39.640> use<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.300> book<00:03:40.510> mode<00:03:40.750> as<00:03:40.930> I've<00:03:41.080> shown

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
course use it in book mode as I've shown

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.280 
course use it in book mode as I've shown
you<00:03:41.380> already<00:03:41.950> or<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:43.210> can<00:03:43.330> put<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.600> into<00:03:43.900> stand

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
you already or you can put it into stand

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.680 
you already or you can put it into stand
mode<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.950> there's<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.760> couple<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.300> deep

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
mode and there's a couple of deep

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.510 
mode and there's a couple of deep
grooves<00:03:47.110> on<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:48.130> are<00:03:48.190> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> keep

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
grooves on this that are going to keep

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.970 
grooves on this that are going to keep
it<00:03:48.700> nicely<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.420> place<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.590> don't<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.830> worry

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
it nicely in place so you don't to worry

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.860 
it nicely in place so you don't to worry
about<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.370> falling<00:03:52.000> if<00:03:52.180> you're<00:03:52.330> using<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.750> in

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
about this falling if you're using it in

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.050 
about this falling if you're using it in
your<00:03:53.020> lap<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.800> find<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.370> stand<00:03:54.790> mode

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
your lap and I find that that stand mode

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.720 
your lap and I find that that stand mode
works<00:03:55.330> pretty<00:03:55.690> well<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.890> unique<00:03:57.280> thing<00:03:57.340> about

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
works pretty well the unique thing about

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.570 
works pretty well the unique thing about
this<00:03:58.120> case<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:59.110> swivel<00:03:59.800> mechanism<00:03:59.920> and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
this case is the swivel mechanism and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.490 
this case is the swivel mechanism and
this<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.180> why<00:04:01.330> this<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.720> cut<00:04:01.900> out<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.260> built

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
this is why this is cut out and built

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.020 
this is why this is cut out and built
this<00:04:02.710> way<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.760> will<00:04:04.210> swivel<00:04:04.770> just<00:04:05.770> like<00:04:06.700> this

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
this way this will swivel just like this

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.990 
this way this will swivel just like this
and<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:08.020> goes<00:04:08.200> into<00:04:08.380> portrait<00:04:08.890> mode<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.400> now

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
and it goes into portrait mode and now

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.720 
and it goes into portrait mode and now
you<00:04:10.060> can<00:04:10.390> use<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> stand<00:04:11.080> in<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.320> position<00:04:11.800> or

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
you can use a stand in that position or

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.449 
you can use a stand in that position or
you<00:04:13.390> can<00:04:13.600> use<00:04:13.780> it<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.590> position<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.340> if

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
you can use it in that position so if

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.910 
you can use it in that position so if
your<00:04:15.610> face<00:04:15.850> time<00:04:16.180> chatting<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:17.080> really<00:04:17.560> does

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
your face time chatting it really does

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.670 
your face time chatting it really does
serve<00:04:18.310> its<00:04:18.640> purpose<00:04:19.150> quite<00:04:19.450> well<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.440> couple

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
serve its purpose quite well so a couple

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.010 
serve its purpose quite well so a couple
of<00:04:20.920> different<00:04:21.220> options<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.540> when<00:04:22.900> you're

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
of different options for you when you're

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.140 
of different options for you when you're
using<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.590> case<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.640> how<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.910> looks

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150
