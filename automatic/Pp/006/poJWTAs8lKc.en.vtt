00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
level of effort I think that's why we've

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.690 
level of effort I think that's why we've
seen<00:03:06.500> some<00:03:06.710> great<00:03:06.830> results<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.490> short

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
seen some great results in a short

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.040 
seen some great results in a short
amount<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.940> time<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.150> will<00:03:08.480> continue<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.840> do

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
amount of time and will continue to do

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.250 
amount of time and will continue to do
so

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260
