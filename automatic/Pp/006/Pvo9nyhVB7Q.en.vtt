00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
guess that's pretty much all i can say

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.520 
guess that's pretty much all i can say
since<00:00:44.400> i<00:00:44.489> never<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:45.000> plain<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> stuff<00:00:46.170> um

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
since i never really plain and stuff um

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.450 
since i never really plain and stuff um
i<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.790> might<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:47.940> fun<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.720> I<00:00:49.280> can't<00:00:50.280> say
