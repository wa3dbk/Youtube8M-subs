00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.869
 Today told in the press 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:30.939
 Republican Service 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.189
 traffic police Alexey Miller declared that the election 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.189
 showed a good face 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.089
 in the seaside 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.369
 sochi 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.459
 it looks like drivers have a question 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.369
 the holy koran says not 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.709
 answers 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.259
 must have been first secretary of the council 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.739
 Armed Forces 40 Kazakhstanis were 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.829
 faster 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.829
 first seven or eight people marmots 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.619
 reiteration 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.189
 I 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.059
 besides himself 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.059
 and much 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.669
 match but also ordered to reach the level 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.029
 rating score with Russia 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.339
 but what happened through 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.949
 transparent reported 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.079
 in general, noted that in his estimates on this 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.909
 the tournament 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.400
 I think that the rally 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.550
 very good, as if a little bit unlucky with 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.520
 by colleagues 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.699
 prime tass 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.069
 truck not knowingly associated with this in 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.840
 the new generation area transmits 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.110
 oilru.com probably i'm just amazed 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.629
 secondary whole played very well 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.919
 for the second time just coming 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.270
 horrible 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.870
 100 kilometers from Sirta Criminal Investigation and 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.889
 date about this broken colleagues 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:47.900
 the region 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.400
 so I thought 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 during the survey only 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.710
 the second noted then anyone played on 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.430
 equal even 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.490
 but so far everything is going according to plan 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.770
 such a statement today is simply not 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.389
 will come 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.389
 therefore documented 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.550
 this is the third place to study 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.919
 Perspectives on stake 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.009
 how do you rate the performance we live 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:17.789
 and 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.460
 no one wonders if this will be 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.510
 during the low pressure gas pipeline
