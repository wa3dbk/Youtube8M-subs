it shows the device name is it has one

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.120 
it shows the device name is it has one
it<00:01:04.820> also<00:01:05.149> shows<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.899> MAC<00:01:06.290> addresses<00:01:06.320> are

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
it also shows the MAC addresses are

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.320 
it also shows the MAC addresses are
computers<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.060> my<00:01:08.240> network<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:09.170> have<00:01:09.410> names

computers on my network that have names

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.480 
computers on my network that have names
so<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.360> displays<00:01:12.080> these<00:01:12.979> are<00:01:13.190> things<00:01:13.399> that

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
so that displays these are things that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.719 
so that displays these are things that
don't<00:01:13.850> have<00:01:14.150> names<00:01:14.619> so<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:15.770> just<00:01:15.950> says<00:01:16.100> unknown

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
don't have names so it just says unknown

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.969 
don't have names so it just says unknown
for<00:01:17.210> example<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.630> see<00:01:17.780> how<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:17.930> can<00:01:18.409> change<00:01:18.440> I

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
for example to see how this can change I

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.399 
for example to see how this can change I
have<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.430> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.000> on<00:01:20.240> my<00:01:20.450> droid<00:01:20.840> currently

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
have the Wi-Fi on my droid currently

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.280 
have the Wi-Fi on my droid currently
turned<00:01:21.650> off<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.760> I'll<00:01:22.880> turn<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.240> on<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.170> now

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
turned off so I'll turn it on and now

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.910 
turned off so I'll turn it on and now
we'll<00:01:24.500> click<00:01:24.740> refresh<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.229> see<00:01:27.229> right<00:01:27.439> here

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
we'll click refresh and see right here

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.390 
we'll click refresh and see right here
is<00:01:28.810> my<00:01:29.810> droid<00:01:30.200> wasn't<00:01:30.830> in<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.040> list<00:01:31.220> before

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
is my droid wasn't in the list before

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.890 
is my droid wasn't in the list before
but<00:01:34.400> I<00:01:34.430> can<00:01:34.580> tell<00:01:34.729> by<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.880> IP<00:01:35.090> address<00:01:35.600> that

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
but I can tell by the IP address that

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.740 
but I can tell by the IP address that
this<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.470> my<00:01:36.619> droid<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.820> this<00:01:38.030> way<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.509> can

this is my droid so in this way you can

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.310 
this is my droid so in this way you can
see<00:01:39.049> which<00:01:39.470> devices<00:01:39.890> are<00:01:40.670> attached<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.750> your
