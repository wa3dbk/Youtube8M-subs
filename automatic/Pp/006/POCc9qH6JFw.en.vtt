00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.080
 Is also a child of a tree 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:13.529
 It is the fifth update review this time we went 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:18.150
 But that this time most of the once again of the spell I spell it is Tteyuu Hay strike 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:20.840
 I feel like I can hear the voice that Ju will increase even more 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.570
 By Tteyuu is yes spell 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.010
 I want to see a little while soon 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.250
 It is a comparison of the page in that 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 In terms of speeding up your bill 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.670
 Lazy 4 e 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.300
 I do not mean that the attack power will be strong 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.570
 In terms of being able to move quickly 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:49.930
 I need two more spells so far, but I have one for new spells . 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:55.600
 Why the fact that One of proof as possible in space 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.660
 I think that it may be a spell that will be used quite often in the future 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 High 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.340
 I would like to see practical videos using that company right away 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.370
 Piano unit formation Hara bat is remembered like a balloon 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.160
 It's an Eva Rabaruka child 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.300
 By first using a variant 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.990
 so 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.979
 And Te' Tsu even once at the anti-aircraft gun rubber 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.500
 The do that follow this 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.550
 Say that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.550
 Right 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.120
 In that the spell from this time becomes quite many 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.080
 That alone extends the breadth of the strategy 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.410
 I think it's going to be interesting 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.520
 Also the soldier new child this time by say 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.120
 I was actually using it is standing try videos 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.400
 I would like to keep improving if there are pattern update information etc. 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.390
 Please register after a high rating 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.390
 Bye-bye at home 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.420
