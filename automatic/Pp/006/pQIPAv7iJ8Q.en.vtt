00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.699
 hello very good ballistic and atocha 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.080
 commenting and welcome to another game 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.669
 of modern warfare 3 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.380
 now I will explain to you why we are in 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.880
 piece because it has to do with the subject 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.220
 in question that I will talk to you in the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.110
 today as I have been able to verify and 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.029
 as you have seen in these 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.439
 weeks because I take advantage of the games that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.849
 more or less I get it right or are 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.920
 entertaining to see by saying it 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.930
 some way to talk about a topic in 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.610
 question because modern warfare and the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.110
 bald in general are already very seen what 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.850
 he took advantage of this type of games 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.190
 to talk about a subject in question and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.719
 especially for and to try that the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.239
 that participates yes that we have a 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.370
 I share opinions about everything 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.239
 respectful and entertaining entertaining between 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.800
 you among yourselves and I like 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.590
 You could check well the week 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.090
 last two weeks ago I talked about the you use 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.380
 of the batel filtres of the complaints of 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.660
 because people hated so much modern 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.070
 warfare 3 but did not criticize the failures 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.420
 that they could have other games of the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.070
 importance also had the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.479
 playlists in the channel but 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.990
 good is another subject that I already have to 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.070
 get it out within a few days because 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.600
 but good circumstances that you already 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.670
 I will comment at the time 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.560
 good 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.970
 and I wanted to take advantage of this game that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.740
 Low confirmed in piece as you are 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.830
 being able to check to talk about the subject 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.560
 in question of which I wanted to speak to you today 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.659
 and it's the star theme that takes 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.460
 speaking for so many years in this 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.229
 generation and especially from the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.470
 last three years you could say or 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.270
 since the first armor of 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.280
 800 oblivion horse microsoft by 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.759
 that the ones from the efes the content 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.460
 downloadable because it is criticized so much 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.490
 this or because it should or should not praise 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.950
 really but what good points does it have and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.659
 what bad points are good this is 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.369
 quite relative under my point of view 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.200
 above all, it depends a lot on the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.009
 companies and also consumers 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.229
 sometimes it worth really worth 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.750
 there are times that they simply should not 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.030
 never buy but well this is a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 eternal debate that I never know if it's going to 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.709
 come to some end because because we are going to 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.930
 go breaking it down in a way 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.329
 progressive for 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.120
 to try to explain it the simplest 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.159
 possible and that is the most fun 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.290
 I think that from the point of view of 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.629
 any player if you have a game 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.730
 fetish a very good game a game 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.739
 star for you at your point of 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.439
 personal view any content 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.989
 downloadable or game expansion 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.219
 the theme the theme of the word expansion 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.019
 it's a subject that was used before 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.760
 very much I started but now the subject 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.140
 of expansion is quite null only 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.650
 are used in games like 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.860
 oblivion times practically skyrim and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.330
 but I think that whatever 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.550
 content that increases the experience 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.700
 playable and the hours especially is something 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.770
 that you like so much deserves to be bought or 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.900
 well, the fact of saying fuck is 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.340
 that this game I like and above me 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.280
 are giving more content to him then 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.480
 I buy it if you like what you enjoy 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.370
 even many times it is irrelevant what 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.310
 that can cost is the dlc not even 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.350
 you can be abusive or not but it's 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.760
 curious what happens lately not for 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.850
 example you are seeing piazza I have 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.180
 bought the map collection 1 the modern 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.269
 warfare 3 because it is a scam is very expensive 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.190
 for what it offers yes why because 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 four maps when I started 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.970
 they were always free so now that you 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.290
 charge them as not but good as 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.420
 is a theme that has been done since 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.280
 practically the call of duty 4 or good 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.620
 even from the 20th I think that even 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.019
 they came to cost a lot from the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.450
 call of duty the teams but what 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.890
 happens if you buy that very 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.180
 easy because modern warfare teles to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.800
 despite being a game that many people 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.540
 criticizes and that I get angry with him 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.470
 many times is a game that at 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.600
 final ended playing 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.580
 I take advantage of that downloadable content if 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.370
 that's why I buy it even if it costs fifteen 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.790
 euros is a scam yes I know but I buy it 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.769
 and I enjoy it I think that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.719
 too many people do that for the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.760
 fact that good according to the tastes 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.159
 of each person will benefit is more a 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.379
 title not the problem or the debate comes 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.870
 when your downloadable content is 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.390
 inside the disc when they are clipped 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.840
 as it usually happens lately not the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.479
 last case for example is the tlcs 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.789
 before the game itself comes out you say 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.430
 but good you're taking me start 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.870
 calling yes practically because it is 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.850
 saying we look at this part of the game 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.650
 which is very interesting to say it of 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.320
 some sarcastic way is very 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.030
 interesting but we're going to cut it 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.340
 you stay with the desire and if you want to pay 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.320
 or a tactic that they usually do a lot 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.520
 It is usually hey if you buy our 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.500
 collector's edition that of 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.710
 collectors have nothing 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.560
 we really give you that lct that guy 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.880
 of skullduggery is the problem and it's the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.289
 eternal debate that is happening 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.210
 always not for example companies like 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.460
 as capcon and his street fighter x tekken 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.690
 uncles and they are innumerable of times 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.419
 previous street fighter suits 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.889
 for example the fact of remembering you good 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.910
 to leave 12 characters inside the disc 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.180
 and then charge the 20 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:11.320
 It is what makes this generation 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.780
 be a bit like saying it 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.330
 a little falling into the abyss of 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.790
 dlcs and in the downloadable content 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.920
 abusive for example to ideals like the 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.720
 gta 4 for example that is a content 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.860
 that you added new missions had 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.600
 new characters had new 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.310
 story and that is interesting for 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.130
 example those of the fa the new vegas and 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.960
 three the future for the air outlet 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.450
 but if they are term expansions 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.970
 expansions is a term that I believe 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.310
 what companies how to use could 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.480
 say they continue to use it albeit in a 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.480
 form a little bit 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.980
 but hey I wanted to open this topic for 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.270
 that you leave me your opinion 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.100
 I know it's the same subject that has been 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.540
 talked many times but I thought 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.610
 interesting especially for the gameplay 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.900
 that are coming out which is that it's a 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.310
 downloadable content of modern warfare 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.630
 3 is not that they are always the most is me 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.880
 criticize but those who sell the most 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.620
 So, well, they wanted to know 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.540
 your opinion always respectful 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.950
 please be entertaining and enjoyable 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.480
 between everyone and we can 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.160
 share our opinions 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.470
 greetings guys waited please 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.720
