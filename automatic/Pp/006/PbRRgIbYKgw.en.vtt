get all done building it is the most
cost-effective<00:00:32.270> deer<00:00:32.900> fence<00:00:33.170> I've<00:00:33.380> ever<00:00:33.560> seen

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
cost-effective deer fence I've ever seen

so you know again we went from a

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.780 
so you know again we went from a
long-term<00:00:40.520> sales<00:00:41.180> average<00:00:41.809> of<00:00:42.020> about<00:00:42.790> 3,500

pounds of blueberries out of here every

pounds of blueberries out of here every
year<00:00:45.940> until<00:00:46.940> we<00:00:47.059> put<00:00:47.239> this<00:00:47.390> fence<00:00:47.629> up<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.050> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
year until we put this fence up in the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.680 
year until we put this fence up in the
year<00:00:48.320> after<00:00:48.470> that<00:00:48.650> we<00:00:48.950> sold<00:00:49.330> 14,000<00:00:50.330> pounds<00:00:50.629> of

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
blueberries from the from the same tax

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.170 
blueberries from the from the same tax
that<00:00:53.059> was<00:00:53.180> just<00:00:53.449> phenomenal<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:54.199> had<00:00:54.410> no<00:00:54.589> idea

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
that was just phenomenal I had no idea

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.979 
that was just phenomenal I had no idea
that<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.330> could<00:00:56.480> make<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.750> much<00:00:56.809> difference

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
that it could make that much difference

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.869 
that it could make that much difference
this<00:00:57.500> keeping<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.949> deer<00:00:58.129> out<00:00:58.159> and<00:00:58.670> our

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
this keeping the deer out and our

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.210 
this keeping the deer out and our
problem<00:00:59.330> is<00:00:59.510> wintertime<00:01:00.260> when<00:01:01.100> they're

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
problem is wintertime when they're

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.910 
problem is wintertime when they're
coming<00:01:01.519> in<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:01.820> browsing<00:01:02.500> they<00:01:03.500> never<00:01:03.710> touch

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
coming in and browsing they never touch

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.070 
coming in and browsing they never touch
a<00:01:03.949> leaf<00:01:04.220> they<00:01:04.430> never<00:01:04.640> touch<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> berry<00:01:05.239> but

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
a leaf they never touch a berry but

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.470 
a leaf they never touch a berry but
wintertime<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.130> was<00:01:07.310> thus<00:01:07.550> prime<00:01:07.820> brows<00:01:08.120> and

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
wintertime it was thus prime brows and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.140 
wintertime it was thus prime brows and
so<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:08.990> they<00:01:09.170> came<00:01:10.150> months<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.270> way<00:01:11.800> to<00:01:13.150> find

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
so in they came months the way to find

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.120 
so in they came months the way to find
inner<00:01:14.390> brow<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.320> what<00:01:15.500> are<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:15.680> looking<00:01:15.979> at

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
inner brow so what are we looking at

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.469 
inner brow so what are we looking at
here<00:01:16.430> well<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.810> is<00:01:17.960> an<00:01:18.110> inside<00:01:18.620> corner<00:01:19.479> you

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
here well this is an inside corner you

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.980 
here well this is an inside corner you
know<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.659> accommodate<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.590> slant<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.600> you

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
know to accommodate the slant and you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.340 
know to accommodate the slant and you
just<00:01:24.790> run<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.820> fence<00:01:26.119> up<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.110> then

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
just run the fence up to that and then

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.690 
just run the fence up to that and then
the<00:01:27.500> same<00:01:27.710> way<00:01:27.950> coming<00:01:28.340> from<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.610> other

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the same way coming from the other

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.789 
the same way coming from the other
direction<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:29.509> just<00:01:29.810> way<00:01:30.020> across<00:01:30.530> there

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
direction and then just way across there

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.359 
direction and then just way across there
and<00:01:31.070> their<00:01:31.460> health<00:01:31.640> closer<00:01:32.180> together<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
and their health closer together the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.260 
and their health closer together the
wires<00:01:34.610> yeah<00:01:35.149> every<00:01:35.810> foot<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:36.969> there<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.090> how

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
wires yeah every foot and there is how

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.480 
wires yeah every foot and there is how
many<00:01:38.450> strands<00:01:38.750> went<00:01:39.140> well<00:01:39.680> there<00:01:40.070> are<00:01:40.159> seven

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
many strands went well there are seven

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.620 
many strands went well there are seven
strands<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.270> an<00:01:41.450> 8<00:01:41.600> foot<00:01:41.810> fence<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.789> and<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
strands it's an 8 foot fence and and the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.649 
strands it's an 8 foot fence and and the
real<00:01:45.320> simplicity<00:01:46.159> of<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.579> construction<00:01:47.450> is

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
real simplicity of the construction is

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.440 
real simplicity of the construction is
that<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.829> can<00:01:49.009> use<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.219> tee<00:01:49.520> post<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.270> use

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
that you can use a tee post you can use

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.599 
that you can use a tee post you can use
wooden<00:01:50.990> posts<00:01:51.439> we<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.740> them<00:01:51.859> both<00:01:52.009> way<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
wooden posts we have them both way and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.690 
wooden posts we have them both way and
you<00:01:52.700> put<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> nail<00:01:53.450> or<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.689> screw<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:54.200> there<00:01:54.380> and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
you put a nail or a screw in there and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.319 
you put a nail or a screw in there and
for<00:01:55.700> mowing<00:01:55.939> underneath<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.939> can<00:01:59.119> actually

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
for mowing underneath you can actually

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.050 
for mowing underneath you can actually
sense<00:02:00.289> they<00:02:00.469> just<00:02:00.710> rest<00:02:00.950> on<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.280> ground<00:02:01.549> this

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
sense they just rest on the ground this

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.700 
sense they just rest on the ground this
thing<00:02:02.329> will<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.509> pick<00:02:02.810> right<00:02:03.049> up<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:03.619> you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
thing will just pick right up and so you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.389 
thing will just pick right up and so you
can<00:02:03.950> get<00:02:04.130> underneath<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.700> with<00:02:04.909> a<00:02:04.939> more<00:02:06.399> it

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
can get underneath it with a more it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.890 
can get underneath it with a more it
back<00:02:07.579> down<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.470> of<00:02:09.590> course<00:02:10.000> we<00:02:11.000> electrify<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
back down and of course we electrify the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.140 
back down and of course we electrify the
strands<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> deer<00:02:13.430> would<00:02:13.610> be<00:02:13.760> likely<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
strands that the deer would be likely to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.360 
strands that the deer would be likely to
hit<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.630> they<00:02:14.840> as<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.350> came<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.890> at<00:02:16.160> about

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
hit as they as they came in at about

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.550 
hit as they as they came in at about
that<00:02:16.550> height<00:02:16.820> but<00:02:17.570> they<00:02:17.750> won't<00:02:17.990> jump<00:02:18.350> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
that height but they won't jump it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.160 
that height but they won't jump it
because<00:02:19.550> they<00:02:20.390> think<00:02:20.450> they're<00:02:20.750> going<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.960> land

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
because they think they're going to land

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.430 
because they think they're going to land
on<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.440> fence<00:02:22.720> you've<00:02:23.720> got<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> strand<00:02:24.320> of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
on the fence you've got a strand of

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.979 
on the fence you've got a strand of
barbed<00:02:24.740> wire<00:02:24.800> there<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.909> know<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.420> was<00:02:26.959> just

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
barbed wire there you know that was just

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.530 
barbed wire there you know that was just
because<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.950> had<00:02:28.310> barbed<00:02:28.610> wire

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
because I had barbed wire

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.869 
because I had barbed wire
oh<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.680> wasn't<00:02:30.890> using<00:02:31.189> it<00:02:31.459> because<00:02:31.580> we

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
oh and I wasn't using it because we

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.429 
oh and I wasn't using it because we
didn't<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.120> cattle<00:02:32.599> anymore<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.200> point

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
didn't have cattle anymore at that point

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.410 
didn't have cattle anymore at that point
but<00:02:34.370> when<00:02:34.939> I<00:02:34.970> costed<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:37.010> thing<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.180> last

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
but when I costed the thing out the last

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.410 
but when I costed the thing out the last
time<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:39.110> checked<00:02:39.579> with<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.700> cost<00:02:40.909> of<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.239> wire

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
time I checked with the cost of the wire

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.420 
time I checked with the cost of the wire
the<00:02:41.450> cost<00:02:42.019> of<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.319> post<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.920> cost<00:02:43.159> of<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
the cost of the post the cost of the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.300 
the cost of the post the cost of the
lumber<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.000> everything<00:02:44.720> else<00:02:44.980> about<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> half

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
a mile of this was in the neighborhood

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.619 
a mile of this was in the neighborhood
of<00:02:50.629> 40<00:02:51.349> cents<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.739> foot<00:02:52.390> very<00:02:53.390> easy

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629

that section there you know 250 feet

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.119 
that section there you know 250 feet
over<00:03:02.269> here<00:03:02.540> just<00:03:03.409> by<00:03:03.590> pulling<00:03:03.799> out<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
over here just by pulling out the

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.759 
over here just by pulling out the
uprights<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.540> had<00:03:05.750> each<00:03:06.200> one<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.590> kids

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
uprights and we had each one of the kids

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.949 
uprights and we had each one of the kids
and<00:03:07.010> grandkids<00:03:07.340> grab<00:03:07.790> every<00:03:08.180> other<00:03:08.299> post<00:03:08.659> and

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
and grandkids grab every other post and

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.949 
and grandkids grab every other post and
just<00:03:08.989> dragged<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.620> right<00:03:10.129> across<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.609> field

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
just dragged it right across the field

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.899 
just dragged it right across the field
drove<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.109> uprights<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.829> put<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.579> right<00:03:13.700> back

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
drove the uprights in put it right back

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.009 
drove the uprights in put it right back
up<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:15.709> would<00:03:15.889> think<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.879> if<00:03:17.329> someone<00:03:17.599> was

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
up and I would think that if someone was

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.619 
up and I would think that if someone was
protecting<00:03:18.950> some<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.579> know<00:03:19.670> orchard<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.239> trees

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
protecting some you know orchard a trees

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.129 
protecting some you know orchard a trees
or<00:03:20.930> or<00:03:21.849> strawberries<00:03:22.849> or<00:03:23.060> whatever<00:03:25.090> cucumbers

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
or or strawberries or whatever cucumbers

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.050 
or or strawberries or whatever cucumbers
you<00:03:27.139> could<00:03:27.799> probably<00:03:28.040> come<00:03:28.519> up<00:03:28.639> with<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.819> good

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
you could probably come up with a good

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.210 
you could probably come up with a good
roller<00:03:29.810> system<00:03:30.230> where<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.680> could<00:03:30.799> roll<00:03:31.010> up

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
roller system where you could roll up

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.920 
roller system where you could roll up
large<00:03:31.459> sections<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:32.599> it<00:03:32.690> out<00:03:32.780> of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
large sections of it to get it out of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.610 
large sections of it to get it out of
the<00:03:33.019> way<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.680> know<00:03:33.709> for<00:03:35.319> when<00:03:36.319> you're<00:03:36.500> out

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
the way you know for when you're out

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.110 
the way you know for when you're out
there<00:03:36.799> doing<00:03:36.919> your<00:03:37.069> initial<00:03:37.340> field<00:03:37.730> work<00:03:37.940> in

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
there doing your initial field work in

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.509 
there doing your initial field work in
the<00:03:38.150> spring<00:03:40.359> you<00:03:41.359> know<00:03:41.389> we<00:03:42.370> nothing<00:03:43.370> is

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
the spring you know we nothing is

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.400 
the spring you know we nothing is
foolproof<00:03:43.699> and<00:03:44.269> we<00:03:44.389> have<00:03:44.660> had<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.199> know<00:03:45.379> a

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
foolproof and we have had you know a

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.839 
foolproof and we have had you know a
pond<00:03:46.160> or<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.609> sneak<00:03:47.030> through<00:03:48.459> when<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:49.639> have

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
pond or to sneak through when we have

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.150 
pond or to sneak through when we have
had<00:03:50.090> one<00:03:50.329> slip<00:03:50.660> through<00:03:50.930> they<00:03:51.260> will<00:03:51.739> jump<00:03:51.949> out

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
had one slip through they will jump out

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.900 
had one slip through they will jump out
but<00:03:52.819> they<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.150> not<00:03:53.359> jump<00:03:53.660> in<00:03:54.639> from<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.760> high

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
but they will not jump in from the high

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.599 
but they will not jump in from the high
side<00:03:56.440> because<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.650> guess<00:03:57.859> a<00:03:57.889> fear<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.250> landing

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
side because I guess a fear of landing

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.100 
side because I guess a fear of landing
on<00:03:58.699> the<00:03:58.819> way

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.510 

looks<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:07.260> you're<00:04:07.410> using<00:04:07.560> wood<00:04:07.920> poles<00:04:08.190> for

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
looks like you're using wood poles for

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.900 
looks like you're using wood poles for
your<00:04:08.700> uprights<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.240> this<00:04:09.390> end<00:04:09.630> yeah<00:04:10.790> matter<00:04:11.790> of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
your uprights on this end yeah matter of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.170 
your uprights on this end yeah matter of
fact<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.860> use<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.040> few<00:04:14.220> Tico's<00:04:14.610> when<00:04:15.030> we

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
fact if I use the few Tico's when we

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.110 
fact if I use the few Tico's when we
when<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.720> moved<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.110> but<00:04:16.320> yeah<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.430> was<00:04:17.790> all

heavy posts where you were stretching
the<00:04:32.490> line<00:04:32.670> so<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.060> didn't<00:04:33.300> get<00:04:33.840> everything

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
the line so you didn't get everything

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.200 
the line so you didn't get everything
all<00:04:34.410> contorted<00:04:34.740> with<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.190> how<00:04:35.730> long<00:04:35.940> will<00:04:36.120> the
