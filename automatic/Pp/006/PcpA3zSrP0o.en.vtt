to make us more complete team I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.849 
to make us more complete team I
tonight<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.510> key<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.260> things<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
14 turnovers and then I thought the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.769 
14 turnovers and then I thought the
second<00:00:28.830> factor<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.429> our<00:00:29.609> bench<00:00:29.880> led<00:00:30.570> by

players<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.910> tournament<00:00:57.329> specifically

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
players in this tournament specifically

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
players in this tournament specifically
three<00:00:58.410> days<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> three<00:00:58.859> three<00:00:59.579> days<00:00:59.760> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
three days and three three days and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
three days and three three days and
three<00:01:00.059> days<00:01:00.359> los<00:01:00.660> huge<00:01:01.109> huge<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> time<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
three days los huge huge all the time I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.889 
three days los huge huge all the time I
think<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> great<00:01:02.940> point<00:01:03.239> especially<00:01:03.539> when

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
think it's a great point especially when

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.620 
think it's a great point especially when
you're<00:01:04.019> playing<00:01:04.199> three<00:01:04.470> games<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.890> three<00:01:04.920> days

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
you're playing three games in three days

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.539 
you're playing three games in three days
you<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> thought<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> couple<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.380> our<00:01:07.500> guys

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
you know I thought a couple of our guys

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.700 
you know I thought a couple of our guys
certainly<00:01:08.549> made<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.030> plays<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.540> us<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.530> one

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
certainly made some plays for us but one

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
certainly made some plays for us but one
is<00:01:10.860> consistent<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.549> their<00:01:11.790> energy<00:01:12.210> level

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
is consistent with their energy level

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
is consistent with their energy level
maybe<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> our<00:01:13.860> hire<00:01:14.040> men<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.460> guys<00:01:14.610> but

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
maybe some of our hire men and guys but

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
maybe some of our hire men and guys but
I<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.509> tell<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> bench<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.470> ready

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.580 
I will tell you that the bench was ready
to<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:18.000> good<00:01:18.299> teams<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.500> know

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the game the guys we put it finished it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
the game the guys we put it finished it
the<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.450> were<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.720> ready<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> go

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and like I said earlier it's a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
and like I said earlier it's a
tremendous<00:01:33.390> asset<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:36.350> hope<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.950> did

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tremendous asset to have hope what did

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.420 
tremendous asset to have hope what did

there<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.420> much<00:01:42.540> different<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
there was so much different well I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
there was so much different well I
thought<00:01:43.710> he<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.250> active<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:45.479> his

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
hands on a lot of balls that I got a lot

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.340 
hands on a lot of balls that I got a lot
of<00:01:47.759> deflections<00:01:48.479> came<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> big

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
that we do whether that's defensively or

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.180 
that we do whether that's defensively or

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
offensively and we played a pace on the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.280 
offensively and we played a pace on the
offensive<00:05:05.030> end<00:05:05.300> whether<00:05:05.600> that's<00:05:05.810> our

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
offensive end whether that's our

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.640

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
we're running a half-court offense when

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.940 
we're running a half-court offense when
we're<00:05:11.210> hard<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.510> guard<00:05:11.690> tonight<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.560> didn't

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
we're hard to guard tonight I didn't

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.010 
we're hard to guard tonight I didn't

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.630 
feel like we had quite that paste our
half-court<00:05:15.230> offense<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.980> thought<00:05:16.160> we<00:05:16.310> stood<00:05:16.580> a

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
half-court offense I thought we stood a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.850 
half-court offense I thought we stood a
little<00:05:16.940> bit<00:05:17.060> too<00:05:17.240> much<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.990> ball<00:05:18.020> stopped<00:05:18.680> a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
little bit too much we didn't quite have

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.080 
little bit too much we didn't quite have
the<00:05:20.780> energy<00:05:21.080> level<00:05:21.620> we<00:05:21.740> needed<00:05:22.040> there<00:05:22.250> but<00:05:23.060> I

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
the energy level we needed there but I

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.700
