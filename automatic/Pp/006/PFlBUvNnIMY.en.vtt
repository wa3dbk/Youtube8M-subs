00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.410
 Hello, everyone o 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:11.330
 It is Gutchi of the world rubber market also thank you Table Tennis Answers side this time 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:16.160
 I think today's theme will be about rotating drive 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.140
 I've been many issued a video of the rotation drive, which was until now but tic, such as how to capture how the house 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.800
 It is a form to go down finely 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.230
 Please take this into account during this clear stream 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.670
 Head 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.450
 Another fairly and become much Come vehicle rotation who want to play good parenthesis If you want to aim in the US 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.490
 Because it will be covered 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:38.730
 Please try and see the playd bar 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:43.790
 When the point of when using this lower rotary drive to jump at fore when I dropped the RBI 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 It is very effective as a connection technique at the time of pinch etc. 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.089
 When you hit to pain 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 It is chased by being the drive which put the rotation which was not returned with the usual drive 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:59.280
 It will be a frantic drive that you can get points when 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 Strong players sometimes use the spinning drives they say are bothered and mixed up 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.370
 So there are players who are about to hit the ball when the ball falls, changes, or drives home. 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.140
 Mix the rotation drive 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.370
 If you hit think chance the ball and is here at the will continue to leverage from behind Boto' 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.410
 And fall 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.130
 It is true that this lower rotational drive is that you lose a point without knowing that you are chasing the opponent 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.780
 The other party is 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:29.729
 The place of the now will you Umaｰｰthis desperation that have been using traffic well 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.670
 It is called this car rotation drive when we dropped only when it was Higashiichi molars because it was time to jump 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:39.170
 We recommend using a drive of killing 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.980
 When you break the time painful pinch of in strictly rather than ancillary meaning of using the main 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.920
 please use it 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:52.020
 It is a rotational drive like this It looks like a drive on top when you look normally 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.620
 It is a normal upward rotation, but contains the rotation that you have seen 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:02.700
 To be precise, it will be rotation called side down rotation 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.700
 At first, I think it is easier to remember if this lateral rotation is strong 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.990
 When it is said how much it actually cuts 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.800
 I will avoid 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.930
 There was no fire rage in the operation, but it decreased. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 Do the lower rotation drive 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.860
 It was an imaginary position, but it is included so if you hit this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.080
 Will fall 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:30.360
 Then I think that I want to do the way here First of all, one major point is one eye 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.140
 The important thing with eyes is to wrap the face of the racket inside 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.870
 That are doing is to now this super please go out consciousness, such as curve drive 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.130
 In the sense of driving a curve 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.220
 I can catch the face of the racket 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:49.810
 Let's meet this way Take in the racket and fold it inwards and use your wrist for winding. 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:55.240
 Lucky for those of his own about the same kind of feeling as when the surface of the racket to the winding serve 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:58.440
 Really as it is involving the inside that involve using the wrist and toward the face of the racket 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.440
 I will give you a spin 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.310
 Please be aware because the really important thing is to that involving the act flights at the most within the inside 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.900
 The second most important thing is that you drop the bat 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.060
 If you drop if you drop below is also the rotation drive to do this the ball know this 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.060
 It is easy to put a dodger rotation 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:24.640
 Date is gone out speed or got hit not over a period of rotation was high is one 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.200
 When it always lower rotary drive-oriented in order not to be multiplied by the rotation play is 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:34.970
 Please be aware that that attracts drop can only be as much as possible RBI 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.540
 It is the third one It was feeling like throwing a bowling People who put a turn are recommended 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.940
 It becomes the way of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:47.450
 Now actually pretend to look at this little funny child form that beats the spin drive below this 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.850
 I think you are similar to feel like throwing a bowling throw Well this bowling 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:55.230
 I feel it 's Hui, such as throwing the bowling 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.430
 It feels like throwing a ball, but throwing a bowling ball is considered to be disadvantageous 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.830
 It is easy to over rotation 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.710
 It's hard to get started at first, so it's hard to drive the rotation so it's side down 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.000
 We recommend that you use the rotation 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.840
 It's like doing Meiji curve long It's like doing curve long and doing curve driving 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.769
 After that difference 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.250
 Gradually I can say Rutte put the tongue and do with the feeling of procedure Tteyuu do 10 drive 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:23.250
 I think it will be like 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:28.020
 If you look at this real super slow at this real and this rotational drive looks good 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.750
 There is also a downward rotation, but it is mixed with a lateral rotation. To put it correctly, it becomes a drive of side-down rotation 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.590
 The ball is now turning sideways now 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.700
 Finally, please swing to the top of your head in camouflage like head like this 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.360
 It looks like an upturn drive 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.670
 Finally, the racket raises the next after applying the lower rotation drive 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.849
 Then, to see this now 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:53.830
 It looks like it looks like an ordinary upper rotation drive 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:56.300
 Say that rotation was'm ne This fact rotation looks full rotation Poku in camouflage 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.460
 Become a drive for rotation 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.830
 Effect is tremendous to further partner by a well camouflaged and chat to like this Fu 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.880
 Rotation drive that everyone did by all means 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.810
 Please try a challenge 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.289
 As an escape word at the time of the painstaking Special Move Pinch 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.720
 I think it is a very corner, yes 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:21.340
 Alternative book 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.249
 The point is put together easily and pull in one eye side inside 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.429
 The second 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:29.429
 The third to drop the bat and attract 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:32.459
 I felt like I was going to bend O-ring. 

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:38.189
 You may mix horizontal rotation at this time 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:42.080
 Finally put it like a spinning drive on top of your head with a camouflage and swing over 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.670
 It's a place to be more effective 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.380
 Rotation drive that everyone did by all means 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.710
 Since It was remember and try to go to during the break because to do it is while playing try to try 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.710
 Please give me
