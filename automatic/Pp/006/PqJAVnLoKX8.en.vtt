00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.990
 In the Palenstein district in Zoetermeer, three flats have been designated as a lifestyle flat 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.530
 vestia housing association divides new tenants into three categories 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.759
 This is the flat but the people living together are right on top of each other 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.599
 the people who do not like it live in this flat that you call the municipality 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.480
 everyone is the same as each other and behind the Boslaan 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.590
 those are the people who, above all, also rebuild on their own 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.510
 she will later have a boat with her husband and son in the flats with the theme together 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.079
 life 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.110
 that means she likes crowds and fun 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.550
 this also fits in our home 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.990
 a group of children to watch services from noise also made of 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.980
 that will just be this one has 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 in almost every city they are on these large flats from the seventies 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.300
 and they are not very popular 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 also in palenstein there were many problems many of the time limit people 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 were no longer involved with each other did not know each other did not speak with 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.620
 each other 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 and that gave a lot before I talk she is very much dissatisfaction 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.390
 by organizing new tenants in a couple, more solidarity is created and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.220
 residents made more music 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 the neighborhood is therefore enthusiastic 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 the advantage 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.680
 we get less misery and less music 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.530
 that's right the advantage is think it's a great idea 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.640
 I think they want to send some other people into the tent 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.479
 so a problem 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.420
 renters in parts by age income or family composition may of the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.400
 housing law in parts on lifestyle not 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.000
 the association of dutch municipalities wants this changed quickly 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.280
 there it would be important that the options now based on the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.250
 strong experiment in rotterdam 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.790
 and more in traffic 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.130
 but being guided on lifestyles so met the question if it missed for all 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.500
 to make the cities back possible under the Housing Act 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.120
 after all, not everyone wants to become famous 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.100
 the vvd is afraid of a sliding scale 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.820
 I think people are very sorry 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.500
 live separately 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.560
 think that is not good and where does this eventually end 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.350
 and then we all will turn this on 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.320
 next year the housing law will be discussed in the second chamber
