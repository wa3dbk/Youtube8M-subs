a little bit more

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.979

you<00:02:40.269> could<00:02:40.450> either<00:02:40.859> drop<00:02:41.859> how<00:02:42.069> much<00:02:42.989> noise

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
you could either drop how much noise

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.280 
you could either drop how much noise
you're<00:02:44.829> removing<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.700> there<00:02:46.659> has<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.019> nice

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
you're removing and there has this nice

you're removing and there has this nice
little<00:02:47.319> sharpening<00:02:48.010> thing<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.569> increase

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
little sharpening thing you can increase

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.159 
little sharpening thing you can increase
the<00:02:50.260> detail<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.159> little<00:02:51.579> bit<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:52.269> way<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
the detail a little bit that way and

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.640 
the detail a little bit that way and
seeing<00:02:53.829> as<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.129> in<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.310> same<00:02:54.909> video<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:56.530> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
seeing as it's in the same video like it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.619 
seeing as it's in the same video like it
seems<00:02:56.859> it's<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.189> the<00:02:57.310> same<00:02:57.489> plugin<00:02:57.909> it<00:02:58.419> already

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
seems it's in the same plugin it already

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.000 
seems it's in the same plugin it already
has<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.079> video<00:02:59.290> information<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.919> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
has the video information of the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.059 
has the video information of the
original<00:03:00.370> video<00:03:00.609> file<00:03:00.939> so<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.859> actually

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
original video file so you can actually

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.819 
original video file so you can actually
effectively<00:03:03.669> sharpen<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.319> could<00:03:05.650> like

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
effectively sharpen so I could like

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.429 
effectively sharpen so I could like
remove<00:03:06.250> all<00:03:06.400> noise<00:03:06.609> and<00:03:07.079> sharpen<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.290> bit

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
remove all noise and sharpen it a bit

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.670 
remove all noise and sharpen it a bit
and<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:10.450> will<00:03:10.569> preserve<00:03:10.930> quite<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.349> bit<00:03:11.500> of

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and it will preserve quite a bit of

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.970 
and it will preserve quite a bit of
detail<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.049> but<00:03:14.049> most<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.439> time<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> don't

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
detail so but most of time I don't

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.460 
detail so but most of time I don't
really<00:03:15.129> like<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.549> sharpen<00:03:15.939> it<00:03:16.000> because<00:03:16.419> I<00:03:16.810> find

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
really like to sharpen it because I find

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.500 
really like to sharpen it because I find
it's<00:03:18.159> a<00:03:18.310> little<00:03:18.400> bit<00:03:18.609> more<00:03:18.760> green<00:03:19.000> than<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.329> like

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
it's a little bit more green than I like

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.710 
it's a little bit more green than I like
so<00:03:20.169> anyway<00:03:20.859> that's<00:03:21.400> really<00:03:21.790> all<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.120> requires

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
so anyway that's really all it requires

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.379 
so anyway that's really all it requires
that<00:03:23.199> is<00:03:23.379> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.799> 480p<00:03:24.310> video<00:03:24.549> we<00:03:25.299> have

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
that is going to be a 480p video we have

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.140 
that is going to be a 480p video we have
another<00:03:25.569> example<00:03:25.750> here<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.669> going<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:28.000> be

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
another example here it is going to be

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.259 
another example here it is going to be
this<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:31.139> not<00:03:32.139> super<00:03:32.620> great<00:03:32.940> HD<00:03:33.940> video

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
this really not super great HD video

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.240 
this really not super great HD video
this<00:03:34.449> time<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:35.290> one<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:35.530> saw<00:03:35.709> with<00:03:35.859> my<00:03:35.889> newer

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
this time this one we saw with my newer

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.640 
this time this one we saw with my newer
camera<00:03:36.669> let's<00:03:37.540> add<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.870> again<00:03:37.989> there's<00:03:38.500> quite

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
camera let's add it again there's quite

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.589 
camera let's add it again there's quite
a<00:03:38.709> bit<00:03:38.829> of<00:03:38.859> green<00:03:39.609> right<00:03:39.819> here<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.299> shot

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
a bit of green right here on this shot

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.659 
a bit of green right here on this shot
on<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.109> group<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.919> green<00:03:42.129> wall<00:03:42.400> right

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
on the group on the green wall right

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:42.990 
on the group on the green wall right
there

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
there

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.879 
there
so<00:03:43.930> let's<00:03:44.079> configure<00:03:46.500> ancing<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.590> where<00:03:47.769> we're

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
so let's configure ancing is where we're

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.939 
so let's configure ancing is where we're
going<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.159> specifically<00:03:48.790> focus<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.449> green

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
going to specifically focus on the green

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.680 
going to specifically focus on the green
let's<00:03:50.949> select<00:03:51.159> the<00:03:51.370> green<00:03:51.549> auto<00:03:52.060> profile

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
let's select the green auto profile

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.369 
let's select the green auto profile
noise<00:03:53.349> filter<00:03:53.709> settings<00:03:53.919> and<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:56.049> go<00:03:56.199> over

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
noise filter settings and you go over

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.539 
noise filter settings and you go over
here<00:03:56.459> remove<00:03:57.459> only<00:03:57.639> half<00:03:57.909> noise<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.900> works

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
here remove only half noise it works

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.939 
here remove only half noise it works
you're<00:04:00.549> also<00:04:00.729> able<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.120> add<00:04:01.299> like<00:04:01.479> a<00:04:01.510> little

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
you're also able to add like a little

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.890 
you're also able to add like a little
box<00:04:02.949> here<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.609> can<00:04:03.790> figure<00:04:03.970> out<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.750> can

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
box here so you can figure out you can

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.449 
box here so you can figure out you can
see<00:04:05.079> side<00:04:05.439> by<00:04:05.470> side<00:04:05.769> which<00:04:06.099> is<00:04:06.280> filtered

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
see side by side which is filtered

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.289 
see side by side which is filtered
what's<00:04:06.849> not<00:04:08.400> now<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.459> can<00:04:09.759> remove<00:04:09.970> all<00:04:10.120> noise

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
what's not now you can remove all noise

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.449 
what's not now you can remove all noise
and<00:04:10.599> like<00:04:11.199> you<00:04:11.470> can't<00:04:11.739> even<00:04:11.829> tell<00:04:12.069> it's<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.250> skin

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
and like you can't even tell it's a skin

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.449 
and like you can't even tell it's a skin
video<00:04:12.759> clip<00:04:13.030> it's<00:04:13.239> absolutely<00:04:14.229> insane<00:04:14.459> the

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
video clip it's absolutely insane the

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.620 
video clip it's absolutely insane the
kind<00:04:15.669> of<00:04:15.729> differences<00:04:16.150> you're<00:04:16.329> going<00:04:16.449> to<00:04:16.509> see

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
kind of differences you're going to see

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.259 
kind of differences you're going to see
here<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.829> test<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.849> on<00:04:18.940> all<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
here you can test it on all the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.940 
here you can test it on all the
different<00:04:19.539> levels<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.109> detail<00:04:20.259> I've<00:04:20.680> got<00:04:20.859> it

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
different levels of detail I've got it

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.590 
different levels of detail I've got it
around<00:04:21.190> here<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:22.479> works<00:04:22.719> the<00:04:23.169> null

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
around here and it works the null

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.470 
around here and it works the null
all<00:04:24.040> like<00:04:25.040> I'm<00:04:25.250> hardly<00:04:25.550> losing<00:04:25.880> any<00:04:26.030> detail

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
all like I'm hardly losing any detail

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.090 
all like I'm hardly losing any detail
here<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.900> I'm<00:04:27.620> gaining<00:04:28.070> quite<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.580> bit<00:04:28.910> of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
here and I'm gaining quite a bit of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.640 
here and I'm gaining quite a bit of
smoothness<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.230> grain<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.440> being

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
smoothness that and grain is being

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.620 
smoothness that and grain is being
removed<00:04:33.920> at<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> great<00:04:35.270> rate<00:04:35.480> it<00:04:35.780> is<00:04:37.630> definitely

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
removed at a great rate it is definitely

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.140 
removed at a great rate it is definitely
a<00:04:38.870> plug-in<00:04:39.560> on<00:04:39.680> we<00:04:39.770> recommend<00:04:40.220> on<00:04:40.520> every<00:04:41.000> level

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
a plug-in on we recommend on every level

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.760 
a plug-in on we recommend on every level
