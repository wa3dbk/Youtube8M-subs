and leave it behind that said however a
lot<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:07.970> what<00:03:08.060> I'm<00:03:08.150> trying<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.900> book

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
lot of what I'm trying to do in the book

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.370 
lot of what I'm trying to do in the book
is<00:03:10.270> recover<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.630> heart<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.200> lot<00:03:12.350> of

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
is recover the heart of a lot of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.280 
is recover the heart of a lot of
scriptural<00:03:13.310> teachings<00:03:13.880> about<00:03:14.120> marriage<00:03:15.020> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
scriptural teachings about marriage and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.830 
scriptural teachings about marriage and
sexuality<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.030> New<00:03:17.150> Testament<00:03:17.690> talks

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
sexuality and so the New Testament talks

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.140 
sexuality and so the New Testament talks
about<00:03:18.170> how<00:03:18.350> really<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.130> purpose<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.550> marriage

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
about how really the purpose of marriage

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.270 
about how really the purpose of marriage
and<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> purpose<00:03:21.080> of<00:03:21.230> our<00:03:21.320> sexuality<00:03:21.740> is

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
and so the purpose of our sexuality is

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.480 
and so the purpose of our sexuality is
to<00:03:23.030> reflect<00:03:23.300> Christ's<00:03:24.080> love<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.220> church

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
to reflect Christ's love for the church

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.540 
to reflect Christ's love for the church
and<00:03:25.820> in<00:03:26.330> that<00:03:26.450> sense<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:27.020> be<00:03:27.260> an<00:03:27.830> instrument<00:03:28.340> of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
and in that sense to be an instrument of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.030 
and in that sense to be an instrument of
our<00:03:28.670> own<00:03:28.930> self-sacrifice<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.140> our<00:03:30.380> own<00:03:30.500> giving

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
our own self-sacrifice of our own giving

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.750 
our own self-sacrifice of our own giving
and<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.540> root<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.050> idea<00:03:33.440> about

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
and so it's the root of this idea about

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.570 
and so it's the root of this idea about
having<00:03:34.760> sex<00:03:35.060> before<00:03:35.270> marriage<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.580> that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
having sex before marriage is that that

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.270 
having sex before marriage is that that
is<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.790> having<00:03:38.690> sex<00:03:38.720> with<00:03:39.080> somebody<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
is the having sex with somebody is the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.510 
is the having sex with somebody is the
greatest<00:03:41.290> bodily<00:03:42.290> gift<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:43.250> can<00:03:43.370> give

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
greatest bodily gift that you can give

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.460 
greatest bodily gift that you can give
to<00:03:43.550> them<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.970> can't<00:03:44.240> give<00:03:44.960> more<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.350> your

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
to them you can't give more of your

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.520 
to them you can't give more of your
physical<00:03:45.890> selves<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.370> someone<00:03:46.730> than<00:03:47.540> true<00:03:48.170> sex

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
physical selves to someone than true sex

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.740 
physical selves to someone than true sex
and<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.490> idea<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:49.940> if<00:03:50.330> you're<00:03:50.450> giving

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
and so the idea is that if you're giving

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.420 
and so the idea is that if you're giving
all<00:03:50.960> of<00:03:51.110> your<00:03:51.230> physical<00:03:51.650> self<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.070> someone

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
all of your physical self to someone

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.740 
all of your physical self to someone
that<00:03:52.940> should<00:03:53.180> be<00:03:53.300> matched<00:03:53.540> by<00:03:54.350> an<00:03:55.310> equivalent

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
that should be matched by an equivalent

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.360 
that should be matched by an equivalent
emotional<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.020> personal<00:03:57.560> commitment<00:03:58.280> as

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
emotional and personal commitment as

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.550 
emotional and personal commitment as
well<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:59.630> that<00:03:59.840> otherwise<00:04:00.140> it's<00:04:01.100> not<00:04:01.280> really

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
well and that otherwise it's not really

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.200 
well and that otherwise it's not really
it<00:04:03.560> can<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.070> set<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.880> set<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.120> up

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
it can just set you it can set you up

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.210 
it can just set you it can set you up
for<00:04:06.580> giving<00:04:07.580> away<00:04:07.760> much<00:04:07.970> more<00:04:08.210> of<00:04:08.270> yourself

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
for giving away much more of yourself

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.990 
for giving away much more of yourself
partially<00:04:10.220> than<00:04:10.430> you're<00:04:10.550> actually<00:04:10.700> willing

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
partially than you're actually willing

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.370 
partially than you're actually willing
to<00:04:11.120> match<00:04:11.390> up<00:04:11.600> with<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> rest<00:04:12.050> of<00:04:12.170> your<00:04:12.290> life

to match up with the rest of your life

a conversation for a lot of people they

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.180 
a conversation for a lot of people they
haven't<00:04:29.490> wanted<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:30.060> touch<00:04:30.980> Christianity<00:04:31.980> or

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
haven't wanted to touch Christianity or

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.370 
haven't wanted to touch Christianity or
the<00:04:32.220> Bible<00:04:32.760> at<00:04:33.000> all<00:04:33.140> maybe<00:04:34.140> they<00:04:34.320> were

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
the Bible at all maybe they were

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.400 
the Bible at all maybe they were
rejected<00:04:34.860> by<00:04:34.980> their<00:04:35.270> churches<00:04:36.270> or<00:04:37.020> they've

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
rejected by their churches or they've

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.470 
rejected by their churches or they've
just<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:38.100> message<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.820> they've<00:04:39.000> seen<00:04:39.240> from

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
just the message that they've seen from

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.570 
just the message that they've seen from
the<00:04:39.570> church<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:39.990> society<00:04:40.530> has<00:04:40.710> been<00:04:40.920> so

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
the church and society has been so

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.390 
the church and society has been so
polarizing<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.480> hostile<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.920> think<00:04:44.310> it'd

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
polarizing so hostile that I think it'd

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.000 
polarizing so hostile that I think it'd
be<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.520> victory<00:04:44.940> if<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.960> can<00:04:46.170> just<00:04:46.470> present<00:04:46.710> a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
be a victory if I can just present a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:55.840 
be a victory if I can just present a
slightly<00:04:47.400> more<00:04:48.470> appealing<00:04:49.550> less<00:04:52.370> hostile<00:04:53.370> or

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.390 

negative<00:04:56.990> message<00:04:57.990> from<00:04:58.290> Christianity<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.370> I

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
negative message from Christianity so I

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.000 
negative message from Christianity so I
think<00:04:59.520> over<00:04:59.940> time<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:01.440> if<00:05:01.680> anyone's

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
think over time I think if anyone's

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.340 
think over time I think if anyone's
actually<00:05:02.190> going<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.840> share<00:05:03.840> my<00:05:04.080> perspective

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
actually going to share my perspective

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.290 
actually going to share my perspective
on<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:05.460> not<00:05:05.610> going<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:05.820> be<00:05:05.910> from<00:05:06.120> like<00:05:06.270> a

on that it's not going to be from like a

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.140 
on that it's not going to be from like a
few<00:05:07.080> minute<00:05:07.320> interview<00:05:08.100> it's<00:05:08.730> going<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.030> be

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
few minute interview it's going to be

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.200 
few minute interview it's going to be
from<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:12.020> commitment<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.550> really<00:05:14.550> be<00:05:14.700> much<00:05:14.910> more

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
moving much more in a direction toward
