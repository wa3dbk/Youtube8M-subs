00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.240
 video me if the felix from youtube 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.610
 channel felix bar and in this video 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.950
 I would like to buy the ipad bag berlin 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 by chor a bit more detail 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:21.930
 war what the cover berlin bag for 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 ipad he gives though in the two colors 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.740
 black and cognac brown, however, it is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 so that both models very much 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.429
 minimalist in a black 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.170
 simple paper wrapped to you 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.000
 come after you take your bag off 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.649
 You only have to release this paper 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 still the foam part on the thing 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.940
 take out space for the ipad sooner 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 to create the actual inserts 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 The device itself is then very easy 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 you just have to put the leather case on the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.460
 then bring the ipad out on the left side 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.230
 He carefully push in and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.030
 Last but not least , the leather case 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
 again under the tablet stuck 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.750
 you should pay attention that the two 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 parts of the velcro clean 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.109
 It is still there 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.210
 especially important that you get your device 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.340
 really all the way to the stop in the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.019
 pocket pushes there otherwise the lid 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 can not close properly, a very 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.010
 Nice thing is both berlin bag 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
 that really all the ports are knobs and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.060
 switch completely use operable 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.950
 stay on the bottom are 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 tailor-made cutouts for the lightning 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.850
 port and two stereo speakers on 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 the headphone port and the two 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 Microphones were also thought of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.369
 mute switch and the camera are 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.439
 also completely free the volume 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.240
 keys and power button are still 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.070
 time for additional protection of the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 leather the case conceals the easy 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.340
 By the way, that does not hurt at all 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.229
 you can still do more with the heads 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.939
 continue to press super but we come 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.350
 but just for the design because that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.780
 In my opinion, with only one 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 describe two words correctly and well 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.159
 Although simple and noble it is like that 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 that we do not really have anything here in principle 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 special have a completely normal 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.439
 pocket with a flap flap that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.360
 display protects all the little ones 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.770
 things like the magnetic one 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.869
 final mechanism or the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.549
 support for apple smartrac feature 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.409
 in which the display when opening the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.079
 cases automatically or 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.189
 when closing again automatically 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.259
 turns off know in any case 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.939
 liked and especially nice 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.680
 me that the minimalism for the yes 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.660
 Also known as the apple devices are 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.790
 in the cover berlin bag very strong 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.970
 is represented on the entire bag 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.770
 you will not find any 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 only unnecessary approaches to the only 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.400
 ornament that or something on the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.320
 the front is on the bottom right 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.360
 a cover logo but that 's about it 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.520
 but that's really good too 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.620
 This is another very important 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.050
 aspect of the bag totally good 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.850
 And that is the material because exactly 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.160
 like all other bags from the house 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.500
 this is where the berlin model comes from 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.280
 handmade genuine leather 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.990
 sewed together get that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.670
 bags not only a very noble 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.770
 flair but also quite a 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.510
 enjoyable smell and because real 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.280
 Of course, no leather on the production line 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.890
 artificially manufactured material but 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.110
 just a natural product is any looks 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.520
 pocket a little bit different 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.200
 This will get you absolutely 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.850
 individual product that over time 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.459
 also a proper own character 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.520
 another effect of the leather develops 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.840
 but it is also a certain 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.730
 idiosyncrasy when the bag is new 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.770
 it may happen for example 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.360
 that the power button does not work right away 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.650
 really good back 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.330
 But that's not a problem at all 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.860
 because as soon as you at the appropriate 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.540
 Just do that a bit 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.100
 leather so moved back and forth and the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.570
 Just press a bit softly 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.519
 everything works fine again 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.050
 But it can happen that sometimes 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.120
 the blanket does not flap properly at the beginning 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.010
 closes that is but even at all 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.750
 no problem because if you have the ipad 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.730
 again until the stop in the bag 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.830
 everything is like it is again 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.630
 should be in the production quality of 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.310
 Incidentally, there is no bag at all 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.170
 to complain because all stitched sit 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.120
 really very clean the transitions are 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.100
 sealed very well and it dissolves 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.989
 nothing off or falls apart 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.970
 I had earlier mentioned that on 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.890
 the bag will not find a single seam 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.140
 Can somehow just for decoration there 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.420
 but then what is this big nato 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.830
 on the front and what does this do 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.440
 funny thing here behind 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.360
 Well, surprise is the berlin bag 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.280
 not only a bag but also a 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.049
 stand, you take the cover 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.730
 kinks him at the seam and around 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.590
 then put it in the back of the flap 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.269
 the back in you can the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.220
 bag equal to two different ones 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.530
 there are once species 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.269
 a steeper position which is great 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.190
 is suitable if you now sometimes up 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.630
 want to watch a few videos on your ipad 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.910
 you want to pull the movie or something 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.769
 or the ipad just as digital 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.049
 use picture frames and then there 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.459
 it but a flatter angle of the then 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.260
 Great if you are on the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.300
 desk or something on yours 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.290
 I wanted to tap or draw ipad 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.520
 this job shows 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.170
 but once again that one 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.090
 a bit idiosyncratic songs because 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.700
 sometimes it can be your ipad 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.530
 when setting up again immediately 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.510
 but do not worry here too there is one 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.400
 simple and simple solution you can do that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.200
 Display flap simply on the back 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.820
 a bit reserved and then with 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200
 stroke the finger over it 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.670
 that all look back a bit 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.680
 and make it a bit softer 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.080
 and then everything is back 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.730
 stable but now quite apart from the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.800
 design of the processing of 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.080
 stand-up function and so on and so on 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.700
 One buys a bag to be around 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.980
 protect tablet from damage 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.080
 and also as far as this point is concerned 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.940
 Do not be disappointed with Berlin models 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.070
 the entire inside of the bag is 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.900
 namely with so-called flannel material 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.150
 equipped and flannel really one 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.250
 Very soft material is being scratched 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.170
 completely avoided but also before 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.730
 macken or crash remains your device 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.410
 not really unprotected in the 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.900
 closed state it is so that 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.850
 the bag the complete ipad of all 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.650
 Although this does not stop there, it still means 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.420
 Do not wait for your tablet now 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.880
 But you can throw around in the area 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.830
 smaller bumps should be absolutely no 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.540
 well be problem to me is the way also 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.000
 still noticed that the blanket flap 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.010
 again extra padded extra 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.870
 which of course helped that 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.520
 The display also again a 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.200
 whole pieces better before breaks and 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.030
 but so on is protected for 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.620
 At least now the bag is the right one 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.570
 So I think that the bag very much 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.650
 minimalist already simply designed 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.840
 It just became a lot too 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.340
 Schnickschnack renounces what together 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.770
 with this material choice of this one 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.810
 Real leather really very simple and 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.370
 That's why I would say 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.920
 that bag is very good for people 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.660
 It is on one side he is on 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.370
 want to protect every case well but on 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.530
 on the other hand, by no means 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.450
 want to renounce style now asks 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.830
 determine where can i find this bag 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.910
 Buy and answer the question 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.030
 is pretty easy, though under 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.500
 www.abda.de 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.840
 but you do not just find them all 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.970
 bags by cover but also more 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.710
 Tips and tricks will be asked 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.440
 answered and so on and so forth 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.870
 especially the block and the kwf 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.090
 So look over the battery 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.949
 it was now with these 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.480
 also liked by the machart 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.290
 you can just go to my channel 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.940
 drop by youtube and come felix ba 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.190
 94 because there we find more 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.110
 videos and technology and so on and 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.000
 so on so check it out past event 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.710
 want to see more of her that's it 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.330
 but with this video at this point

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.510
 Just see each other next
