00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
being able to just basically hide the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.340 
being able to just basically hide the
thing<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.200> good<00:01:20.530> idea<00:01:20.590> as<00:01:20.830> well<00:01:21.070> um<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.630> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
thing is a good idea as well um but the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.710 
thing is a good idea as well um but the
one<00:01:23.530> bad<00:01:23.740> thing<00:01:23.800> about<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.760> it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
one bad thing about that is it's it's

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.270 
one bad thing about that is it's it's
kind<00:01:26.050> of<00:01:26.140> complicated<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.980> lot<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:27.190> people

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
kind of complicated and a lot of people

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.910 
kind of complicated and a lot of people
don't<00:01:27.730> know<00:01:27.850> how<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.000> do<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.690> one<00:01:29.620> thing<00:01:29.800> i

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
don't know how to do that so one thing i

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.010 
don't know how to do that so one thing i
did<00:01:30.070> find<00:01:30.310> out<00:01:30.490> how<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.700> do<00:01:30.910> is<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.270> there's<00:01:31.960> a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020

CraftBukkit server in which i've run

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.920 
CraftBukkit server in which i've run
both<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.440> what<00:03:47.590> pops<00:03:47.799> up<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.480> and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
both this is what pops up you know and

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.330 
both this is what pops up you know and
this<00:03:50.200> one<00:03:50.410> does<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> really<00:03:50.889> good<00:03:51.099> job<00:03:51.160> of

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
this one does a really good job of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.509 
this one does a really good job of
making<00:03:51.549> clean<00:03:52.269> but<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.349> still<00:03:53.530> have<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.680> hide

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
making clean but you still have to hide

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.559 
making clean but you still have to hide
to<00:03:55.030> minimize<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.799> tray<00:03:57.359> but<00:03:58.359> with

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
to minimize this to the tray but with

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.960 
to minimize this to the tray but with
this<00:03:58.780> power<00:03:59.079> menu<00:03:59.319> version<00:03:59.799> i<00:04:00.280> can<00:04:00.700> actually

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
this power menu version i can actually

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.259 
this power menu version i can actually
go<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.209> here<00:04:01.419> and<00:04:01.450> hit<00:04:01.720> menu<00:04:02.109> or<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:03.310> menu<00:04:04.030> and

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
go in here and hit menu or a menu and

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.030 
go in here and hit menu or a menu and
then<00:04:04.810> minimize<00:04:05.109> trips<00:04:05.500> that's<00:04:05.799> right

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
then minimize trips that's right

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.789 
then minimize trips that's right
clicking<00:04:06.280> on<00:04:06.489> just<00:04:06.819> any<00:04:06.970> kind<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.329> a<00:04:07.470> bar<00:04:08.470> and

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
clicking on just any kind of a bar and

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.589 
clicking on just any kind of a bar and
you<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:09.340> actually<00:04:09.459> minimize<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.150> tray<00:04:10.180> and

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
you can actually minimize to tray and

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.150 
you can actually minimize to tray and
that<00:04:10.720> works<00:04:10.959> about<00:04:11.139> any<00:04:11.560> program<00:04:11.950> but

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
that works about any program but

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.370 
that works about any program but
specifically<00:04:13.060> my<00:04:13.299> purpose<00:04:13.660> would<00:04:13.840> be<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.230> to

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
specifically my purpose would be just to

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.759 
specifically my purpose would be just to
minimize<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.340> tray<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.660> then<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.959> way<00:04:17.139> my

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
minimize to tray so then that way my

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.000 
minimize to tray so then that way my
minecraft<00:04:18.549> server<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.120> my<00:04:19.419> MC<00:04:19.930> server<00:04:20.139> ogy

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
minecraft server and my MC server ogy

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.279 
minecraft server and my MC server ogy
are<00:04:21.519> both<00:04:21.700> down<00:04:21.880> here<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.780> then<00:04:22.900> i<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:23.110> close

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
are both down here so then i can close

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.540 
are both down here so then i can close
this<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:26.130> bring<00:04:27.130> up<00:04:27.280> minecraft

good to go and you can let the

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.260 
good to go and you can let the
background<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.520> mean<00:05:32.640> like<00:05:32.760> that<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.090> I<00:05:33.150> mean

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
background I mean like that and I mean

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.570 
background I mean like that and I mean
even<00:05:33.540> even<00:05:34.020> if<00:05:34.230> even<00:05:34.530> if<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.250> don't<00:05:35.400> want<00:05:35.520> to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
use like a g-way like I'm doing you know

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.750 
use like a g-way like I'm doing you know
you<00:05:37.410> could<00:05:37.650> just<00:05:37.740> go<00:05:38.030> um<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.530> breaking<00:05:40.530> up<00:05:40.760> go

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
you could just go um I breaking up go

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.480 
you could just go um I breaking up go
like<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.090> and<00:05:42.390> then<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:43.560> know<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.830> the

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
like that and then you know the the

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.310 
like that and then you know the the
chevre<00:05:45.030> subbed<00:05:45.240> out<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:45.660> then<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:45.990> just<00:05:46.110> do

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
chevre subbed out and then you just do

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.180 
chevre subbed out and then you just do
like<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.400> have<00:05:47.610> a<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:48.320> have<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.500> shortcut<00:05:49.920> of<00:05:50.040> mine
