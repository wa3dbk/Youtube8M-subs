00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
for position we took some inspiration

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.190 
for position we took some inspiration
from<00:01:35.500> also<00:01:36.220> genre<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.210> video<00:01:37.420> game<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:37.990> FPS

so<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:39.040> have<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> capture<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.729> flag<00:01:39.880> well

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
so we have a capture the flag well

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.450

obviously<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.320> have<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.740> find<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.040> flag<00:01:42.250> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
obviously you have to find the flag and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.940 
obviously you have to find the flag and
carry<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.000> your<00:01:43.150> base<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.680> others

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950

they try to run down your car in order

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.680 
they try to run down your car in order
to<00:01:47.410> make<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.800> flagpole<00:01:48.280> then<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:48.970> can<00:01:49.150> grab

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
to make the flagpole then you can grab

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.780 
to make the flagpole then you can grab
it<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.050> bring<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.830> your<00:01:51.040> base<00:01:51.190> shift<00:01:51.640> is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
it and bring it to your base shift is

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.460 
it and bring it to your base shift is
also<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> little<00:01:52.479> bit<00:01:52.600> different<00:01:53.050> in<00:01:53.200> online

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
also a little bit different in online

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.770 
also a little bit different in online
multiplayer<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.640> has<00:01:54.790> three<00:01:54.820> functions<00:01:55.479> one

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
multiplayer it has three functions one

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.570 
multiplayer it has three functions one
of<00:01:55.900> those<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.020> cars<00:01:56.380> form<00:01:56.740> which<00:01:56.920> just<00:01:57.190> spawns

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
of those is cars form which just spawns

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.490 
of those is cars form which just spawns
a<00:01:57.729> car<00:01:57.940> on<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.330> on<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.720> spot<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.200> can<00:01:59.350> also

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
a car on the on the spot you can also

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.830 
a car on the on the spot you can also
transform<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.550> car<00:02:00.790> from<00:02:01.000> one<00:02:01.180> car<00:02:01.420> into

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
transform the car from one car into

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.540 
transform the car from one car into
another<00:02:02.050> car<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.470> saying<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.860> end<00:02:03.160> up<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.460> a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
another car so saying you end up in a

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.000 
another car so saying you end up in a
slow<00:02:04.120> vehicle<00:02:04.510> liking<00:02:04.810> bus<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.590> can<00:02:05.740> very

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
slow vehicle liking bus you can very

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.469 
slow vehicle liking bus you can very
quickly<00:02:06.190> transform<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.390> much<00:02:07.659> quick

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
quickly transform that is a much quick

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.119 
quickly transform that is a much quick
and<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> third<00:02:08.959> thing<00:02:08.989> that<00:02:09.229> we<00:02:09.409> have<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
and the third thing that we have is the

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.940 
and the third thing that we have is the
impulse<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.849> that<00:02:11.000> allows<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.830> apply<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
impulse and that allows you to apply a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.460 
impulse and that allows you to apply a
kick<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.760> someone<00:02:14.090> else's<00:02:14.390> car<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:14.930> say<00:02:15.440> for

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
kick to someone else's car so say for

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.869 
kick to someone else's car so say for
example<00:02:15.680> they're<00:02:16.190> chasing<00:02:16.549> after<00:02:16.700> your

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
example they're chasing after your

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.030 
example they're chasing after your
friend<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.540> apply<00:02:17.900> an<00:02:18.080> impulse<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.650> them<00:02:18.769> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
friend and apply an impulse to them it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.100 
friend and apply an impulse to them it
will<00:02:19.190> give<00:02:19.370> them<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:20.000> kick<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.659> so<00:02:20.810> suddenly

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
will give them a kick and so suddenly

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.360 
will give them a kick and so suddenly
they'll<00:02:21.290> find<00:02:21.470> themselves<00:02:21.590> driving<00:02:22.159> sideways

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
they'll find themselves driving sideways

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.940 
they'll find themselves driving sideways
or<00:02:22.790> backwards<00:02:23.440> even<00:02:24.440> though<00:02:24.590> we've<00:02:24.769> been

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
or backwards even though we've been

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.500 
or backwards even though we've been

up and running for as long as we have
it's<00:02:29.900> still<00:02:30.260> something<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.769> gets<00:02:31.040> people<00:02:31.489> in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it's still something that gets people in

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
it's still something that gets people in
the<00:02:31.849> studio<00:02:32.269> laughing<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.930> enjoying<00:02:33.290> playing

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the studio laughing and enjoying playing

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.119 
the studio laughing and enjoying playing
it<00:02:35.290> once<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.379> get<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> bunch<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.890> friends

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
it once you get a bunch of friends

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.250 
it once you get a bunch of friends
together<00:02:37.400> all<00:02:37.790> competing<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.720> shift<00:02:39.110> of

ability and stealing cars off each other
it<00:02:41.239> gets<00:02:41.390> quite<00:02:41.569> heated<00:02:41.720> at<00:02:41.989> times
