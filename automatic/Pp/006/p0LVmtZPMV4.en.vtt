00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 Dr 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.389
 Hello in this video more tips on how to make a link on the desktop or 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.670
 in the start menu create a linker can also give the bull market points to 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.920
 to be able to edit these faster if necessary what the hoster part 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.250
 In principle, however, it is easy for others to discuss it as well as Didier himself 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.339
 For the last time I believe in the series around the so-called desktops sent 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.920
 some setting I now have the video of which both are for 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.240
 Most people do not really make sense so far they should now in Lohr 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.210
 if they know what they are doing 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.530
 start with the first link to our test org or one 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.710
 Link to our test ob 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.180
 We create and hire that editor with the baby 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.340
 Machsters want to edit JST with emergency beds simply Notepad 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 dial tone 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 and then correspondingly tender for Easter MC Windows 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 the system 32 sec du Albers 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.210
 GCC 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.580
 out 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.580
 Davos has just stated the name 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030
 finish finishing 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 how so 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
 Of course it would not be possible to edit "rough" 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.510
 still a test entry what Winterdienst should not imitate 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 Big blind Google Chrome Dr 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 save does not work 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.260
 patched cache 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.920
 So why not save why not but of course not the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 corresponding rights have just 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.480
 System 32 directory or subdirectories 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.340
 to write so normal right mouse button to call the properties 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.770
 Click here to link to all relevant ones click here as 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.300
 Run admin okay okay take over 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.990
 ReSound now warmer of Dr user Conny control asked if that's okay 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.690
 is, of course, that we are very myself so the whole again 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.270
 Inserted this works with the save and that's us 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.840
 actually, I thought now you can do it all in our state mini 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.750
 move to a position where it may be a bit smarter but 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
 may not access it daily 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.169
 sitting up there, of course, can now sit here 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.919
 call again at any time the user account control was only when 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.209
 Tel we can hope that the whole program so Windows learns that and us 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.599
 the next time, but also if not is not so tragic 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.729
 I would not recommend the appropriate rights of the file too 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.879
 change because if we set that now so that we could always one 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.889
 maybe Wave even owners are then of course that can go too 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.889
 change corresponding chartres 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.669
 this among others in the yesterday phishing 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.699
 Of course, videos and all about the whole thing then again 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.019
 negates that makes no sense
