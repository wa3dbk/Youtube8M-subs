to three so ar-15 platform so the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.930 
to three so ar-15 platform so the
magazine<00:00:39.899> itself<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.800> Sarah<00:00:41.250> coated<00:00:41.760> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
magazine itself is all Sarah coated so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
magazine itself is all Sarah coated so
again<00:00:42.180> full<00:00:42.420> aluminum<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.290> Sarah<00:00:43.800> coated<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
again full aluminum all Sarah coated to

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.180 
again full aluminum all Sarah coated to
a<00:00:44.430> ceramic<00:00:45.090> paint<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.840> ceramic<00:00:46.469> surface<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
a ceramic paint or ceramic surface and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.720 
a ceramic paint or ceramic surface and
then<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> internals<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.950> anodized<00:00:49.950> so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
then the internals are anodized so

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
then the internals are anodized so
throughout<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> channel<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.440> completely

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
throughout the channel it's completely

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.189 
throughout the channel it's completely
friction<00:00:53.280> resistance<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.719> surface

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
friction resistance so it's a surface

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.049 
friction resistance so it's a surface
that<00:00:55.230> doesn't<00:00:55.860> need<00:00:56.309> any<00:00:56.699> type<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that doesn't need any type of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.779 
that doesn't need any type of
lubrication<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:57.960> any<00:00:58.469> graphites<00:00:59.100> whatsoever

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
lubrication or any graphites whatsoever

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
lubrication or any graphites whatsoever
and<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.559> very<00:01:01.680> low-maintenance

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and so it's a very very low-maintenance

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.729 
and so it's a very very low-maintenance
magazine<00:01:03.090> again<00:01:03.539> something<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> don't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
magazine again something that you don't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
magazine again something that you don't
have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> lubricate<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.030> any<00:01:06.360> type<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
have to lubricate or use any type of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.160 
have to lubricate or use any type of
graphites<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.619> simple<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> load<00:01:09.000> easy<00:01:09.720> just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
graphites on simple the load easy just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.980 
graphites on simple the load easy just
spin<00:01:10.560> hold<00:01:10.979> couple<00:01:11.729> rounds<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.810> no

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
spin hold couple rounds at a time so no

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
spin hold couple rounds at a time so no
no<00:01:13.470> external<00:01:13.950> loading<00:01:14.340> system<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> have

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
no external loading system that you have

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
no external loading system that you have
to<00:01:15.360> carry<00:01:15.630> around<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:17.070> drum

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to carry around like some other drum

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
to carry around like some other drum
magazine<00:01:18.000> companies<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.930> use<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> single

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
magazine companies we use a single

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
magazine companies we use a single
channel<00:01:20.100> design<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.090> makes<00:01:21.240> this

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
channel design which is what makes this

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.950 
channel design which is what makes this
work<00:01:21.750> over<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> double<00:01:23.159> stack<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:24.060> forces<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
work over a double stack which forces to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380 
work over a double stack which forces to
and<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.740> spring<00:01:26.100> tension<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.820> one

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and so much spring tension into one

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
and so much spring tension into one
channel<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.470> failures<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
channel that you can get failures to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.580 
channel that you can get failures to
feed<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> patent<00:01:31.049> pending<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
feed so we have a patent pending on a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.859 
feed so we have a patent pending on a
flipper<00:01:32.040> design<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> again<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
flipper design here and again this is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
flipper design here and again this is
one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> things<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.650> super<00:01:35.520> important

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
one of the things it's super important

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.539 
one of the things it's super important
that<00:01:35.939> makes<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.509> drum<00:01:36.960> actually<00:01:37.549> function

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that makes this drum actually function

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.380 
that makes this drum actually function
and<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.060> no<00:01:39.360> failures<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.070> actually

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
and have no failures so this actually

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.139 
and have no failures so this actually
depresses<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> second<00:01:43.110> round<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.549> vote

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
depresses the second round so that vote

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.840 
depresses the second round so that vote
the<00:01:45.390> velocity<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.470> spring<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.490> full

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the velocity of that spring the full

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.109 
the velocity of that spring the full
tension<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> spring<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.920> pushing<00:01:50.579> up

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
tension of that spring is not pushing up

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.539 
tension of that spring is not pushing up
on<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.140> other<00:01:52.380> round<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.979> when<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> bolt

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on to the other round so when the bolt

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.249 
on to the other round so when the bolt
is<00:01:53.700> coming<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.899> getting<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
is coming back you're not getting the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.249 
is coming back you're not getting the
full<00:01:55.530> tension<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.610> spring<00:01:57.540> pushing<00:01:58.110> up

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
full tension of that spring pushing up

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:58.649 
full tension of that spring pushing up
and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
and

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.020 
and
and<00:01:58.869> jamming<00:01:59.560> around<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.609> our<00:02:00.700> two<00:02:00.880> to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and jamming around so this is our two to

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.700 
and jamming around so this is our two to
three<00:02:01.329> model<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:01.810> I'll<00:02:01.869> take<00:02:02.109> you<00:02:02.229> over<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.499> do
