okay<00:00:01.860> in<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.040> tutorial<00:00:02.720> it'll<00:00:03.720> steam<00:00:04.560> engine

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay in this tutorial it'll steam engine

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.410 
okay in this tutorial it'll steam engine
yeah<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.279> my<00:00:05.400> steam<00:00:05.700> engine<00:00:06.029> here<00:00:06.180> huh

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
yeah this is my steam engine here huh

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.970 
yeah this is my steam engine here huh
very<00:00:06.660> exciting<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.140> steam<00:00:07.319> engine<00:00:07.620> isn't<00:00:07.890> it

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
very exciting the steam engine isn't it

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.530 
very exciting the steam engine isn't it
but<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.490> notice<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.389> we're

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
but you notice what I have in here we're

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.330 
but you notice what I have in here we're
gonna<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> smoke<00:00:10.320> as<00:00:10.530> well<00:00:10.559> so

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
gonna do it with the smoke as well so

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.610 
gonna do it with the smoke as well so
but<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.700> inside<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.240> domain<00:00:12.690> like<00:00:13.559> this

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
but it's inside this domain like this

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.450 
but it's inside this domain like this
and<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.350> our<00:00:16.350> domain<00:00:16.830> right<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.250> for

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
and this is a our domain right here for

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
and this is a our domain right here for
smoke<00:00:17.730> thirty<00:00:18.090> subdivisions<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.380> less

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
smoke thirty subdivisions we do less

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.779 
smoke thirty subdivisions we do less
than<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.800> maybe<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.100> low<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.340> twenty<00:00:20.580> four

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
than that maybe as low as twenty four

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.120 
than that maybe as low as twenty four
just<00:00:21.029> because<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.300> wanted<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.689> quick<00:00:22.130> I'm

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
just because we wanted to be quick I'm

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.890 
just because we wanted to be quick I'm
trying<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.850> real<00:00:24.029> time<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
trying to do like in real time the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.269 
trying to do like in real time the
environment<00:00:25.439> made<00:00:25.560> me<00:00:25.619> make<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> steam

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
environment made me make this steam

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.980 
environment made me make this steam
train<00:00:26.609> steam<00:00:26.910> engine<00:00:27.240> go<00:00:27.420> around<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> track

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
train steam engine go around the track

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
train steam engine go around the track
of<00:00:28.560> course<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> modify<00:00:29.189> your<00:00:29.310> steam

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
of course you can modify your steam

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.370 
of course you can modify your steam
train<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> look<00:00:30.210> much<00:00:30.420> nicer<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.109> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
train to look much nicer than that but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.549 
train to look much nicer than that but
this<00:00:32.040> kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> serves<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.870> example<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.320> what

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this kind of serves the example so what

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
this kind of serves the example so what
I<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.700> object<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
I have in here is just this object I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
I have in here is just this object I
call<00:00:36.570> cube<00:00:37.380> well<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:37.860> gonna<00:00:37.950> change<00:00:38.280> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
call cube well we're gonna change that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
call cube well we're gonna change that
so<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:38.760> gonna<00:00:38.850> call<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> train<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> we

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
so we're gonna call that train so we

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.319 
so we're gonna call that train so we
know<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> only

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
know what it is but that's not the only

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
know what it is but that's not the only
thing<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.780> here<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> separate<00:00:43.710> object

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
thing in here I have a separate object

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.880 
thing in here I have a separate object
that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.670> mapped<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> location<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that I mapped to this location and this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.060 
that I mapped to this location and this
location<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.730> parented<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.950> if

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
location is parented to this here so if

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
location is parented to this here so if
I<00:00:50.160> grab<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.910> move<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I grab this and move it you can see it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.010 
I grab this and move it you can see it
follows<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> along<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> where

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
follows it along and on here is where

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869 
follows it along and on here is where
I've<00:00:55.140> put<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.590> flow<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.730> I've<00:00:56.850> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I've put my flow here so I've just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.810 
I've put my flow here so I've just
changed<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.809> normal<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:59.340> admitting

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
changed it like normal and I'm admitting

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
changed it like normal and I'm admitting
from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> mesh<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> initial

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
from the mesh and I put the initial

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250 
from the mesh and I put the initial
velocity<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.170> I'm

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
velocity on like this so then I'm

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
velocity on like this so then I'm
running<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
running it here so I actually have a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
running it here so I actually have a
keyframe<00:01:06.780> set<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.200> already<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.130> I'm

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
keyframe set up already so what I'm

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730 
keyframe set up already so what I'm
gonna<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.490> rid<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> those<00:01:08.820> keyframes<00:01:09.680> for<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
gonna get rid of those keyframes for the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.570 
gonna get rid of those keyframes for the
moment<00:01:11.040> cuz<00:01:11.159> that's<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> want

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
moment cuz that's not all that I want

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
moment cuz that's not all that I want
okay<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.750> let's<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.680> object<00:01:16.890> I'll

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
okay so let's see for this object I'll

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
okay so let's see for this object I'll
go<00:01:17.400> down<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.810> keyframe<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> move

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
go down down to that keyframe and move

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
go down down to that keyframe and move
it<00:01:20.009> whoops

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it whoops

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
it whoops
move<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.259> keyframe<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
move it and up to that keyframe and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
move it and up to that keyframe and
remove<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.659> gonna<00:01:24.840> leave<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
remove it and I'm just gonna leave it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
remove it and I'm just gonna leave it
there<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.759> able<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
there so I want to be able to make this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
there so I want to be able to make this
go<00:01:27.570> around<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> circle<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.130> thing

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
go around a circle so that's one thing

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
go around a circle so that's one thing
and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> let's<00:01:32.939> show<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> problems

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and then so let's show you the problems

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.670 
and then so let's show you the problems
that<00:01:33.689> come<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.380> maybe<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.640> above<00:01:36.680> maybe

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that come in so maybe from above maybe

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580 
that come in so maybe from above maybe
I'll<00:01:37.890> start<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.369> circle<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> says<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.590> don't

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
I'll start a circle that says I don't

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.899 
I'll start a circle that says I don't
know<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
know it's gonna be over here like this

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.740 
know it's gonna be over here like this
I'll<00:01:42.180> press<00:01:42.420> shift<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> add<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> Bezier<00:01:43.500> circle

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
I'll press shift and add a Bezier circle

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.230 
I'll press shift and add a Bezier circle
where's<00:01:45.750> my<00:01:46.020> circle<00:01:46.590> that'll<00:01:47.310> work<00:01:47.520> I'll

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
where's my circle that'll work I'll

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.810 
where's my circle that'll work I'll
scale<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.840> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.759> kind<00:01:50.759> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
scale it up a little bit kind of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.690 
scale it up a little bit kind of
approximate<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.520> let

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
approximate it to be right there and let

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.980 
approximate it to be right there and let
me<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.119> yeah<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:55.020> enough<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.530> just

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
me see yeah it's good enough for just

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.880 
me see yeah it's good enough for just
where<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.439> there's<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> couple

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
where it's going to be there's a couple

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249 
where it's going to be there's a couple
ways<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.000> either<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
ways we can do this we can either you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
ways we can do this we can either you
know<00:02:01.350> attach<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.280> path<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
know attach this to the path but the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.729 
know attach this to the path but the
best<00:02:03.090> way<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.820> we<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.210> just

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.880 

attach<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.879> path<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.079> for

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
attach it to the path so like for

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.910 
attach it to the path so like for
instance<00:02:11.920> if<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.459> do<00:02:12.519> if<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.420> click<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:14.400> here

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
instance if I do if I click this here

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.009 
instance if I do if I click this here
they<00:02:17.920> move<00:02:18.129> up<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.370> little<00:02:18.519> bit<00:02:18.670> closer<00:02:19.019> they

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
they move up a little bit closer they

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.339 
they move up a little bit closer they
move<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.379> up<00:02:20.560> too<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:21.420> click<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.659> and<00:02:23.019> then

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
move that up too I click this and then

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.849 
move that up too I click this and then
shift<00:02:23.709> click<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:24.189> and<00:02:24.459> do<00:02:24.849> ctrl<00:02:25.329> P<00:02:25.599> do<00:02:26.109> follow

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
shift click that and do ctrl P do follow

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.759 
shift click that and do ctrl P do follow
path<00:02:27.250> let's<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.389> let's<00:02:28.780> run<00:02:28.959> all<00:02:29.170> day<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.620> see

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
path let's do let's run all day and see

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.449 
path let's do let's run all day and see
what<00:02:29.920> happens

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
what happens

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.360 
what happens
well<00:02:30.879> it's<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.180> around<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.569> path<00:02:32.370> like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
well it's going around the path like

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.410 
well it's going around the path like
that<00:02:34.709> for<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.859> hundred<00:02:36.159> frames<00:02:36.400> well<00:02:37.299> we

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that for the hundred frames well we

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.270 
that for the hundred frames well we
could<00:02:37.569> do<00:02:37.659> that<00:02:37.689> for<00:02:37.900> now<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.409> guess<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:39.129> would

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
could do that for now I guess that would

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.679 
could do that for now I guess that would
be<00:02:39.400> that'd<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:40.150> okay<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.139> it's<00:02:41.260> going<00:02:45.689> it's

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
be that'd be okay but it's going it's

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.909 
be that'd be okay but it's going it's
going<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.079> wrong<00:02:47.200> direction<00:02:47.260> let's<00:02:47.829> see

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
going in the wrong direction let's see

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.030 
going in the wrong direction let's see
that<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:49.329> frames<00:02:49.780> 100<00:02:50.439> evaluation

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
that around here frames 100 evaluation

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.240 
that around here frames 100 evaluation
time<00:02:51.329> follow<00:02:52.500> yeah<00:02:53.500> we<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.829> change<00:02:54.099> that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
time follow yeah we can change that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.920 
time follow yeah we can change that
around<00:02:54.310> just<00:02:54.669> by<00:02:54.969> taking<00:02:55.329> this<00:02:55.419> path<00:02:55.659> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
around just by taking this path and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.240 
around just by taking this path and
doing<00:02:56.139> RX<00:02:56.709> one<00:02:57.459> eight<00:02:57.700> zero<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.590> and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
doing RX one eight zero like that and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.970 
doing RX one eight zero like that and
then<00:03:00.370> we'll<00:03:00.489> take<00:03:00.669> this<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.180> do<00:03:01.269> our<00:03:01.719> x<00:03:02.620> one

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
then we'll take this and do our x one

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.399 
then we'll take this and do our x one
eight<00:03:03.430> zero<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:04.419> that<00:03:04.719> okay<00:03:05.049> now<00:03:05.200> let's

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
eight zero like that okay now let's

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.440 
eight zero like that okay now let's
press<00:03:05.680> all<00:03:05.859> day<00:03:08.669> yeah<00:03:09.669> well<00:03:09.969> that's<00:03:10.269> not

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
press all day yeah well that's not

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.300 
press all day yeah well that's not
really<00:03:10.719> the<00:03:10.840> best<00:03:10.989> curved<00:03:11.319> path<00:03:11.590> follow<00:03:11.950> but

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
really the best curved path follow but

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.460 
really the best curved path follow but
you<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.299> think<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.659> get<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.840> idea

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
you know I think you get the idea

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.990 
you know I think you get the idea
but<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.889> problem<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:16.409> let<00:03:17.409> me<00:03:17.530> see<00:03:17.819> where<00:03:18.819> is

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
but the problem is let me see where is

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.180 
but the problem is let me see where is
that<00:03:19.269> that's<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.629> little<00:03:19.810> horsey<00:03:20.229> horsy

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
that that's a little horsey horsy

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.539 
that that's a little horsey horsy
so<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:21.659> flip<00:03:22.659> that<00:03:22.810> around<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.319> this<00:03:23.530> so

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.589 

make<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:30.700> down<00:03:30.969> to<00:03:31.150> 100<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.110> 100<00:03:33.359> okay<00:03:34.359> all

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
make this down to 100 and 100 okay all

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.869 
make this down to 100 and 100 okay all
day<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.680> there<00:03:35.859> it<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.069> falling<00:03:36.400> around<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
day so there it is falling around the

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.390 
day so there it is falling around the
path<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.659> you<00:03:37.780> see<00:03:37.989> there<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.920> goes<00:03:39.099> there's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
path but you see there it goes there's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.899 
path but you see there it goes there's
our<00:03:39.609> smoke<00:03:40.709> but<00:03:41.709> only<00:03:41.859> this<00:03:42.250> smoke<00:03:42.549> when<00:03:42.819> it

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
our smoke but only this smoke when it

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:49.170 
our smoke but only this smoke when it
gets<00:03:43.090> into<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.359> domain<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.579> here<00:03:48.879> so

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
gets into the domain like in here so

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.059 
gets into the domain like in here so
press<00:03:49.510> all<00:03:49.750> day<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.409> runs<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.739> that

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
press all day and so it runs like that

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.710 
press all day and so it runs like that
but<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.310> course<00:03:54.519> we<00:03:54.670> want<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.000> domain<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.599> be

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
but of course we want the domain to be

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.899 
but of course we want the domain to be
part<00:03:56.019> of<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.170> whole<00:03:56.290> situation<00:03:56.680> too<00:03:57.189> right<00:03:59.909> so

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
part of the whole situation too right so

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.220 
part of the whole situation too right so
let's<00:04:01.090> see<00:04:01.180> if<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:01.269> can<00:04:01.389> parents<00:04:01.720> domain<00:04:02.079> as

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
let's see if I can parents domain as

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.039 
let's see if I can parents domain as
well<00:04:02.409> we're<00:04:02.650> gonna<00:04:02.769> parent<00:04:03.159> the<00:04:03.430> domain<00:04:04.049> to

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
well we're gonna parent the domain to

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:12.030 
well we're gonna parent the domain to
the<00:04:05.139> path<00:04:08.669> control<00:04:09.669> P<00:04:10.000> path<00:04:10.269> follow<00:04:10.859> let's<00:04:11.859> see

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
the path control P path follow let's see

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.080 
the path control P path follow let's see
what<00:04:12.189> that'll<00:04:12.579> work<00:04:12.730> yeah<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:15.310> will<00:04:15.489> once<00:04:15.939> we

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
what that'll work yeah it will once we

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.409 
what that'll work yeah it will once we
set<00:04:16.299> them<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.509> right<00:04:16.599> location<00:04:19.590> okay<00:04:20.590> so

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
set them in the right location okay so

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.360 
set them in the right location okay so
let's<00:04:22.419> see<00:04:22.690> I'm<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.199> going<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.650> take<00:04:24.130> this

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
let's see I'm just going to take this

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.159 
let's see I'm just going to take this
guy<00:04:24.699> and<00:04:24.729> let<00:04:25.060> me<00:04:25.180> see<00:04:25.449> I<00:04:25.479> want<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.810> take<00:04:25.960> this

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
guy and let me see I want to take this

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.290 
guy and let me see I want to take this
guy<00:04:26.470> let<00:04:27.130> me<00:04:27.190> see<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.520> move<00:04:27.699> him<00:04:27.880> over<00:04:28.000> there

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
guy let me see if I move him over there

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.320 
guy let me see if I move him over there
see<00:04:28.660> what<00:04:28.780> happens<00:04:29.110> there<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.729> usually

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
see what happens there this is I usually

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.830 
see what happens there this is I usually
hard<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.840> would<00:04:31.960> usually<00:04:32.110> use<00:04:32.349> curve<00:04:32.770> deform

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
hard you would usually use curve deform

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.089 
hard you would usually use curve deform
because<00:04:34.840> curve<00:04:35.199> deform<00:04:35.530> gives<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.919> more

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
because curve deform gives you more

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.010 
because curve deform gives you more
control<00:04:36.490> over<00:04:36.610> your<00:04:36.789> timing<00:04:37.360> well<00:04:37.750> anyway

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
control over your timing well anyway

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.540 
control over your timing well anyway
this<00:04:38.199> kind<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.500> gives<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.710> idea<00:04:39.039> there's<00:04:39.340> your

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
this kind of gives you idea there's your

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.580 
this kind of gives you idea there's your
that's<00:04:40.210> how<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.419> would<00:04:40.750> set<00:04:40.930> up<00:04:40.990> your<00:04:41.199> general

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
that's how you would set up your general

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.860 
that's how you would set up your general
train<00:04:41.889> cruising<00:04:42.370> around<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.669> track<00:04:42.940> blowing

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
train cruising around the track blowing

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.600 
train cruising around the track blowing
smoke<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:44.949> would<00:04:45.099> even<00:04:45.250> need<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.490> make

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
smoke and you would even need to make

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.129 
smoke and you would even need to make
the<00:04:45.760> Dominion<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.270> big<00:04:46.510> anyway<00:04:46.810> oh<00:04:47.110> it's

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
the Dominion that big anyway oh it's

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.659 
the Dominion that big anyway oh it's
changing<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.800> because<00:04:47.949> I<00:04:48.010> have<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.159> adaptive

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
changing it because I have the adaptive

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.740 
changing it because I have the adaptive
domain<00:04:49.030> set<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.680> there<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.010> goes

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
domain set and there it goes

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.089 
domain set and there it goes
alright<00:04:52.750> so<00:04:53.110> really<00:04:53.409> straightforward<00:04:53.710> and

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
alright so really straightforward and

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.550 
alright so really straightforward and
that<00:04:54.130> works<00:04:54.729> because<00:04:55.000> it's<00:04:55.449> well<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.289> didn't

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
that works because it's well it didn't

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.550 
that works because it's well it didn't
take<00:04:56.680> any<00:04:56.710> time<00:04:56.919> time<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.639> render<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.060> but<00:04:58.990> this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
take any time time to render it but this

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.589 
take any time time to render it but this
kind<00:04:59.800> of<00:04:59.860> effect<00:05:00.159> really<00:05:00.789> easy<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.210> set<00:05:01.360> up<00:05:01.389> in

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
kind of effect really easy to set up in

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.360 
kind of effect really easy to set up in
blender<00:05:01.930> but<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:02.500> other<00:05:02.620> way<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.830> do<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.250> if

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
blender but the other way to do it is if

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.950 
blender but the other way to do it is if
you<00:05:03.490> want<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.820> have<00:05:04.030> more<00:05:04.330> control<00:05:04.690> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
you want to have more control the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.670 
you want to have more control the
problem<00:05:05.229> with<00:05:05.349> this<00:05:05.620> form<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:07.409> control<00:05:08.409> with<00:05:08.650> a

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
problem with this form of control with a

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.439 
problem with this form of control with a
path<00:05:08.949> when<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:09.610> come<00:05:09.760> up<00:05:09.909> here<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.240> curve

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
path when you come up here to the curve

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.399 
path when you come up here to the curve
is<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:11.260> evaluates<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:11.949> over<00:05:12.130> 100<00:05:12.490> frames<00:05:13.409> but

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
is it evaluates it over 100 frames but

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.589 
is it evaluates it over 100 frames but
if<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.620> wanted<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.979> have<00:05:15.130> more<00:05:15.370> control<00:05:15.760> set

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
if you wanted to have more control set

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.170 
if you wanted to have more control set
it<00:05:16.720> up<00:05:16.840> set<00:05:17.289> your<00:05:17.500> object<00:05:17.889> up<00:05:18.039> using<00:05:19.030> a

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
it up set your object up using a

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.689 
it up set your object up using a
modifier<00:05:19.800> like<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.370> use<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.300> curve

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
modifier like this and use the curve

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.420 
modifier like this and use the curve
modifier<00:05:24.699> in<00:05:25.389> here<00:05:26.169> alright<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.800> when<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.280> do

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
modifier in here alright and when you do

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.529 
modifier in here alright and when you do
that<00:05:27.669> it<00:05:28.000> gives<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:29.340> keyframe<00:05:30.340> control<00:05:30.909> over

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
that it gives you keyframe control over

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.529 
that it gives you keyframe control over
these<00:05:31.690> axes<00:05:32.199> it'll<00:05:32.560> go<00:05:32.710> around<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.039> path<00:05:33.220> if<00:05:33.669> X

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
these axes it'll go around the path if X

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.190 
these axes it'll go around the path if X
is<00:05:34.690> set<00:05:34.960> if<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.710> move<00:05:35.949> along<00:05:36.789> X<00:05:37.270> it'll<00:05:37.630> cruise

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
is set if I move along X it'll cruise

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.810 
is set if I move along X it'll cruise
around<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.680> circle<00:05:39.070> but<00:05:39.400> I've<00:05:39.460> done<00:05:39.580> a<00:05:39.639> video

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
around the circle but I've done a video

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.040 
around the circle but I've done a video
on<00:05:40.000> that<00:05:40.090> you'll<00:05:40.270> have<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.419> see<00:05:40.599> that<00:05:40.750> tutorial

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
on that you'll have to see that tutorial

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.680 
on that you'll have to see that tutorial
in<00:05:41.289> my

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
in my

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.960 
in my
curves<00:05:42.320> it's<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.280> there<00:05:43.430> somewhere<00:05:43.640> under

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
curves it's in there somewhere under

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.970 
curves it's in there somewhere under
modifiers<00:05:44.420> or<00:05:44.600> curves<00:05:45.080> I<00:05:45.320> can't<00:05:45.590> remember<00:05:45.800> or

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
modifiers or curves I can't remember or

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.400 
modifiers or curves I can't remember or
maybe<00:05:46.130> I'll<00:05:46.310> do<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.540> another<00:05:47.540> tutorial<00:05:48.170> on<00:05:48.290> this

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
maybe I'll do a another tutorial on this

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.230 
maybe I'll do a another tutorial on this
okay<00:05:49.070> well<00:05:49.190> that's<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:49.550> now<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:49.880> I'll<00:05:50.090> see

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
okay well that's it for now and I'll see

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.810 
okay well that's it for now and I'll see
in<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.360> next<00:05:50.450> lesson
