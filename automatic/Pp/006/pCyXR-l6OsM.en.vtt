 I need to open it more later we're going to 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:34.480
 apply the field that I taught them 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.850
 for nothing else to give that warmth to light and 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.600
 we apply it here under the eyebrows not 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.790
 I want it to go up like this completely 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.290

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.620
 into 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.480
 that's why because the lashes that is 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.900
 because we are so thick with the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.060

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.060
 a lot in the lines that stick well 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 since we have this we are going to take the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:53.239

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.959
 this one that I have already put it simply 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.239
