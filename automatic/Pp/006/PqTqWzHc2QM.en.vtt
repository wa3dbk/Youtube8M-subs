being tested evh testing and so what's
going<00:00:19.849> on<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:20.150> see<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.450> gas<00:00:20.630> canisters<00:00:21.200> I<00:00:21.410> got<00:00:22.160> a

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
going on I see the gas canisters I got a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.859 
going on I see the gas canisters I got a
pollution<00:00:22.880> basically<00:00:23.210> coming<00:00:23.419> through<00:00:23.720> and

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
pollution basically coming through and

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.029 
pollution basically coming through and
you<00:00:23.960> could<00:00:24.050> have<00:00:24.110> read<00:00:24.289> it<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:24.470> for<00:00:24.619> about<00:00:24.710> six

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
you could have read it in for about six

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.409 
you could have read it in for about six
minutes<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:25.460> then<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:25.610> do<00:00:25.700> a<00:00:25.730> lung<00:00:25.939> function

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
minutes and then you do a lung function

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.179 
minutes and then you do a lung function
test<00:00:26.450> and<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.320> see<00:00:27.470> what<00:00:27.590> kind<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.830> response

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
test and to see what kind of response

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.710 
test and to see what kind of response
you<00:00:28.279> have<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.730> pollution<00:00:29.119> in<00:00:29.210> China<00:00:29.539> and
