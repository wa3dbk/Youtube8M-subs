using exactly the same software that he

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.199 
using exactly the same software that he
was<00:02:59.200> using<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.620> game<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.069> do<00:03:03.209> whatever

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
was using the game you can do whatever

you reload and to walk in there too oh
and<00:03:07.450> those<00:03:07.660> inspiring<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.560> understand<00:03:09.190> what's

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
and those inspiring I understand what's

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.030 
and those inspiring I understand what's
going<00:03:09.519> on<00:03:09.910> here<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.420> think<00:03:10.690> was<00:03:11.040> fundamentally

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
going on here I think was fundamentally

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.670 
going on here I think was fundamentally
life-changing<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:12.970> him<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.350> some

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
life-changing for him there are some

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.990 
life-changing for him there are some
handies<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.340> more<00:03:15.489> difficult<00:03:15.670> than

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
handies that are more difficult than

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.069 
handies that are more difficult than
others<00:03:16.120> yes<00:03:16.510> during<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.530> trip<00:03:17.769> Daniel<00:03:18.130> was

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
others yes during the trip Daniel was

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.590 
others yes during the trip Daniel was
just<00:03:20.340> completely<00:03:21.340> absorbed<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.090> everything

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
just completely absorbed in everything

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.910 
just completely absorbed in everything
that<00:03:22.630> was<00:03:22.840> going<00:03:22.989> on<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.470> he<00:03:23.530> was<00:03:23.739> asking

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
that was going on and he was asking

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.910 
that was going on and he was asking
questions<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:25.359> were<00:03:25.510> highly<00:03:26.350> technical

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
questions that were highly technical

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.160 
questions that were highly technical
about<00:03:27.160> how<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.430> actual<00:03:27.940> process<00:03:28.150> works<00:03:28.720> it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
about how the actual process works it

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.930 
about how the actual process works it
was<00:03:29.319> also<00:03:29.500> an<00:03:29.709> enemy<00:03:30.069> game<00:03:30.310> something<00:03:30.790> like
