story of the game obviously was I was an

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.130 
story of the game obviously was I was an
ironic<00:02:35.160> twist<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.430> fate<00:02:35.640> Torres<00:02:36.330> playing

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
ironic twist of fate Torres playing

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.050 
ironic twist of fate Torres playing
Liverpool<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> week<00:02:38.100> after<00:02:38.430> he<00:02:38.520> transferred

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
Liverpool a week after he transferred

from<00:02:39.360> Liverpool<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.200> Chelsea<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.770> thought

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
from Liverpool to Chelsea I thought

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.190 
from Liverpool to Chelsea I thought
Liverpool<00:02:42.000> did<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.180> great<00:02:42.330> job<00:02:42.360> containing<00:02:42.930> him

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
Liverpool did a great job containing him

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.510 
Liverpool did a great job containing him
today<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.980> within<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.310> first<00:02:44.490> couple

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
today I like within the first couple

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.950 
today I like within the first couple
minutes<00:02:44.970> acted<00:02:45.240> kind<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> elbowed<00:02:45.720> him<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
minutes acted kind of elbowed him in the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.390 
minutes acted kind of elbowed him in the
mouth<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.440> after<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.830> pretty<00:02:47.040> boy<00:02:47.190> was

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
mouth and after that the pretty boy was

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.890 
mouth and after that the pretty boy was
kind<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.640> knocked<00:02:47.820> off<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.150> ball<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.600> wasn't

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
kind of knocked off the ball it wasn't

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.900 
kind of knocked off the ball it wasn't
really<00:02:49.140> Torres<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.860> contained<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:50.610> also<00:02:50.730> think

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
really Torres was contained I also think

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.550 
really Torres was contained I also think
it<00:02:51.030> was<00:02:51.120> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.900> fact<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.200> he

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
it was kind of that the fact that he

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.260 
it was kind of that the fact that he
he's<00:02:53.250> only<00:02:53.430> had<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> week<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> train<00:02:54.030> with<00:02:54.150> them

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
he's only had a week to train with them

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
he's only had a week to train with them

at<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.500> table<00:03:22.830> right<00:03:22.950> now<00:03:23.100> Liverpool<00:03:23.459> yeah<00:03:23.970> I

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
at the table right now Liverpool yeah I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.460 
at the table right now Liverpool yeah I
think<00:03:24.090> six<00:03:24.600> points<00:03:25.019> from<00:03:25.260> behind

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.270 
think six points from behind
fourth-place<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.410> think<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.860> would<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.100> be

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
