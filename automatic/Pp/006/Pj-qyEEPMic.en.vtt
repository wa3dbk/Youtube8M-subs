just<00:03:11.760> take<00:03:11.939> out<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.090> ruler<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.599> you<00:03:12.840> were

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
just take out the ruler and you were

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.119 
just take out the ruler and you were
gonna<00:03:13.019> die<00:03:13.290> anyway<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.829> doesn't<00:03:13.890> really

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
gonna die anyway so it doesn't really

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.759 
gonna die anyway so it doesn't really
matter<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.639> then<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.870> pale<00:03:16.139> moon<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.560> only

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
matter and then for pale moon the only

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.110 
matter and then for pale moon the only
water<00:03:16.950> card<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> deck<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.909> have<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
water card in the deck to just have a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.170 
water card in the deck to just have a
little<00:03:18.599> reg<00:03:18.840> activate<00:03:19.379> early<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.970> also

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
little reg activate early and it also

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.869 
little reg activate early and it also
you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.900> banish<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.530> water<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.310> bounce<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.639> card

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
you can banish a water to bounce a card

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.089 
you can banish a water to bounce a card
so<00:03:24.389> let's<00:03:24.569> say<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.139> they<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:25.889> two

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
so let's say if you they have two

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.770 
so let's say if you they have two
monsters<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.700> their<00:03:26.819> field<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:27.599> don't

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
monsters on their field and you don't

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.149 
monsters on their field and you don't
want<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> get<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.200> block<00:03:28.409> because<00:03:28.560> over<00:03:28.769> 200

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
want to get it block because over 200

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.860 
want to get it block because over 200
defense<00:03:29.400> makes<00:03:29.639> your<00:03:29.760> extremely<00:03:30.150> weak<00:03:30.359> you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
defense makes your extremely weak you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.530 
defense makes your extremely weak you
would<00:03:31.019> bounce<00:03:31.200> one<00:03:31.590> card<00:03:31.859> back<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.430> then<00:03:33.120> well

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
would bounce one card back and then well

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.750 
would bounce one card back and then well
you<00:03:33.750> would<00:03:33.870> play<00:03:34.049> blood<00:03:34.290> pale<00:03:34.920> moon<00:03:35.159> that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you would play blood pale moon that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.039 
you would play blood pale moon that
would<00:03:35.879> give<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.150> right<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.450> Jay<00:03:36.629> activate

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
would give you the right to Jay activate

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.009 
would give you the right to Jay activate
and<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.889> would<00:03:38.040> banish<00:03:38.879> pale<00:03:39.299> moon<00:03:39.569> to

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
and then you would banish pale moon to

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.780 
and then you would banish pale moon to
balance<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.500> card<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.920> then<00:03:41.040> her<00:03:41.189> enter<00:03:41.519> effect

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
balance a card and then her enter effect

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.789 
balance a card and then her enter effect
deals<00:03:42.120> 800<00:03:42.359> damage<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> resonator<00:03:43.500> when<00:03:43.650> she

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
deals 800 damage to a resonator when she

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.199 
deals 800 damage to a resonator when she
enters<00:03:44.069> so<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.609> would<00:03:44.730> clear<00:03:44.909> like<00:03:45.060> let's

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
enters so you would clear like let's

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.490 
enters so you would clear like let's
take<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.389> only<00:03:45.540> two<00:03:45.659> monsters<00:03:45.989> they<00:03:46.079> have<00:03:46.260> go

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
take the only two monsters they have go

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.129 
take the only two monsters they have go
for<00:03:46.709> 1200<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.519> then<00:03:48.000> she<00:03:48.269> would<00:03:48.419> flip<00:03:48.569> back<00:03:48.840> at

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
for 1200 and then she would flip back at

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.289 
for 1200 and then she would flip back at
the<00:03:49.319> entrance<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:49.980> that's<00:03:50.579> that's<00:03:50.940> an<00:03:51.150> option

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
the entrance so that's that's an option

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.839 
the entrance so that's that's an option
as<00:03:51.540> well<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:51.959> then<00:03:52.590> same<00:03:53.129> was<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.579> bloody

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
as well and then same was for bloody

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.020 
as well and then same was for bloody
moon<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:55.310> further<00:03:56.310> know<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.639> have

enough<00:03:57.510> moons<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.959> get<00:03:58.109> her<00:03:58.199> to<00:03:58.230> Jay<00:03:58.440> activate

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
enough moons to get her to Jay activate

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.789 
enough moons to get her to Jay activate
as<00:03:58.919> quickly<00:03:59.099> as<00:03:59.280> possible<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.560> destroy<00:04:01.560> magic
