the specific specs that make a Matt

so<00:01:39.000> Joey<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.509> some<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> things<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so Joey what are some of the things that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
so Joey what are some of the things that
make<00:01:40.380> Matt's<00:01:40.700> instrument<00:01:41.700> unique<00:01:41.970> okay<00:01:42.600> we're

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
make Matt's instrument unique okay we're

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
make Matt's instrument unique okay we're
starting<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.770> master<00:01:44.610> volume<00:01:46.100> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
starting out with a master volume that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
starting out with a master volume that
active<00:01:47.490> passive<00:01:47.729> tone<00:01:48.119> roll-off<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:49.110> works

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
active passive tone roll-off which works

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.790 
active passive tone roll-off which works
when<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.039> bass<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.369> active<00:01:50.819> or<00:01:50.970> passive<00:01:51.800> then

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
when the bass is active or passive then

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.859 
when the bass is active or passive then
you<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.130> balanced<00:01:53.580> pot<00:01:53.789> which<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you have a balanced pot which you can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
you have a balanced pot which you can
it's<00:01:55.110> sort<00:01:55.410> of<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> pickup<00:01:55.950> selector<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's sort of like a pickup selector to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.180 
it's sort of like a pickup selector to
go<00:01:57.209> forward<00:01:57.660> goes<00:01:57.869> their<00:01:58.050> neck<00:01:58.200> pickup<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:59.069> the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
go forward goes their neck pickup to the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.889 
go forward goes their neck pickup to the
wheeler<00:01:59.520> bass<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> bridge<00:02:00.300> pickup<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
wheeler bass it's the bridge pickup in

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.050 
wheeler bass it's the bridge pickup in
the<00:02:00.990> center<00:02:01.289> both<00:02:01.470> pickups<00:02:01.770> around<00:02:02.100> then

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the center both pickups around then

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.029 
the center both pickups around then
you'll<00:02:03.179> have<00:02:03.300> active<00:02:03.780> bass<00:02:04.080> mid<00:02:04.709> and<00:02:04.860> treble

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
you'll have active bass mid and treble

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.190 
you'll have active bass mid and treble
cut<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:05.910> boost<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> detent<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.869> each<00:02:06.959> pot

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
cut and boost with a detent in each pot

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.790 
cut and boost with a detent in each pot
so<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> flat<00:02:08.190> flat<00:02:08.910> spot<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.560> three

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so you have a flat flat spot the three

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
so you have a flat flat spot the three
switches<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.459> switch<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.880> an<00:02:12.000> active<00:02:12.300> passive

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
switches one switch is an active passive

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.949 
switches one switch is an active passive
switch<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.849> other<00:02:14.970> switch<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> coil<00:02:15.690> tap

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
switch the other switch is a coil tap

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.870 
switch the other switch is a coil tap
switch<00:02:16.230> tunes<00:02:16.440> when<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.069> flip<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> switch<00:02:17.459> up

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
switch tunes when you flip the switch up

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.850 
switch tunes when you flip the switch up
it<00:02:18.360> taps<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.810> coil<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.410> put<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.770> in

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it taps the coil so you put them in

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.260 
it taps the coil so you put them in
single<00:02:20.069> coil<00:02:20.370> mode<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.880> put<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.120> down

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
single coil mode you can put it down

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.809 
single coil mode you can put it down
it's<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.599> humbucker<00:02:22.020> mode<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:23.280> third<00:02:23.490> switch

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
it's in humbucker mode the third switch

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.910 
it's in humbucker mode the third switch
is<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> mid-range<00:02:24.480> switch<00:02:24.780> flip<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> switch<00:02:25.650> up

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
is a mid-range switch flip the switch up

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.150 
is a mid-range switch flip the switch up
and<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.790> gives<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.300> upper<00:02:27.750> mids<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.200> that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and it gives you a upper mids and that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400 
and it gives you a upper mids and that
with<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.370> time<00:02:29.520> over<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.849> pot<00:02:30.030> does<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:31.170> put

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
with the time over the pot does it put

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800 
with the time over the pot does it put
the<00:02:31.530> switch<00:02:31.709> down<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.280> lower<00:02:32.400> mid<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
the switch down it's a lower mid and

madrone burl top which is a harder wood
very<00:03:25.180> hot<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:25.750> harder<00:03:25.989> than<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.200> boxelder

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
very hot it's harder than the boxelder

very hot it's harder than the boxelder
and<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:28.209> Madagascar<00:03:28.930> rosewood<00:03:29.829> is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
and the the Madagascar rosewood is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.949 
and the the Madagascar rosewood is
softer<00:03:30.519> than<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.849> powerf<00:03:31.060> mm-hmm

softer than the powerf mm-hmm

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.479 
softer than the powerf mm-hmm
so<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.530> two<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.709> them<00:03:32.860> together<00:03:33.010> kind<00:03:33.430> of

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
so the two of them together kind of

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.880 
so the two of them together kind of
complement<00:03:34.030> each<00:03:34.120> other<00:03:34.450> yeah<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.079> just<00:03:35.110> make

complement each other yeah and just make

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.199 
complement each other yeah and just make
the<00:03:36.010> instrument<00:03:36.430> sound<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.670> little<00:03:36.760> more<00:03:36.970> punch

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
the same time so it's got it's had a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.819 
the same time so it's got it's had a
really<00:03:43.510> great<00:03:43.690> character<00:03:43.870> yeah<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.650> still

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
electronics are the same I think I think

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.729 
electronics are the same I think I think
an<00:03:51.430> important<00:03:51.879> thing<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.329> point<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.049> all

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
an important thing to point out is all

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.039 
an important thing to point out is all
of<00:03:54.040> our<00:03:54.190> standards<00:03:54.670> if<00:03:55.390> there<00:03:55.750> are<00:03:55.840> made

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
of our standards if there are made

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.750 
of our standards if there are made
exactly<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.709> same<00:03:56.860> way<00:03:57.220> as<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.459> custom

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
exactly the same way as the custom

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.849 
exactly the same way as the custom
instruments<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:58.390> when<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.349> make<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> Matt

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
instruments so when we make a Matt

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.039 
instruments so when we make a Matt
Garrison's<00:04:00.310> signature<00:04:00.760> instrument<00:04:01.239> for

us<00:04:32.080> give<00:04:32.560> them<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.010> at<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.250> bit<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:33.880> better

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
us give them to you at a bit of a better

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.360 
us give them to you at a bit of a better
price<00:04:34.300> point<00:04:34.570> yeah<00:04:34.900> now<00:04:35.830> what<00:04:36.010> do<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.160> think

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
price point yeah now what do you think

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.830 
price point yeah now what do you think
about<00:04:36.460> comparing<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.720> first

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
about comparing this to the first

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.200 
about comparing this to the first
generation<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.220> back<00:04:39.370> Harrison<00:04:39.789> standard

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
generation of the back Harrison standard

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.600 
generation of the back Harrison standard
playability<00:04:41.080> tone<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> lot<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:42.070> know<00:04:42.190> totally

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
playability tone a lot you know totally

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.029 
playability tone a lot you know totally
we<00:04:42.729> own<00:04:42.880> this<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.690> think<00:04:44.080> as<00:04:44.229> Joey<00:04:44.470> pointed<00:04:44.919> out

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
we own this I think as Joey pointed out

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.670 
we own this I think as Joey pointed out
there's<00:04:45.400> something<00:04:45.849> there's<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.780> tonal

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
there's something there's the tonal

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.740 
there's something there's the tonal
quality<00:04:48.070> is<00:04:48.190> slightly<00:04:48.610> different<00:04:48.910> but<00:04:49.479> the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
quality is slightly different but the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.790 
quality is slightly different but the
interesting<00:04:50.080> thing<00:04:50.139> is<00:04:50.289> that<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.590> really

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
interesting thing is that it really

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.740 
interesting thing is that it really
complements<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.460> other<00:04:51.639> instrument<00:04:52.090> in<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
complements the other instrument in the

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.460 
complements the other instrument in the
sense<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.669> they<00:04:54.669> both<00:04:54.700> can<00:04:55.630> render<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.289> same

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
sense that they both can render the same

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.290 
sense that they both can render the same
results<00:04:57.039> you<00:04:57.370> know<00:04:57.490> in<00:04:57.580> terms<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.970> what<00:04:58.150> you're

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
results you know in terms of what you're

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.860 
results you know in terms of what you're
doing<00:04:58.450> on<00:04:58.870> stage<00:05:00.389> but<00:05:01.389> this<00:05:01.539> one<00:05:01.720> has<00:05:01.840> a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
doing on stage but this one has a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.800 
doing on stage but this one has a
slightly<00:05:02.200> different<00:05:03.000> different<00:05:04.000> tins<00:05:04.360> or

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
slightly different different tins or

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.060 
slightly different different tins or
color<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.280> then<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.120> other<00:05:07.270> one<00:05:07.479> so

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
color and then the other one so

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.890 
color and then the other one so
and<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.520> can<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:09.000> same<00:05:09.180> can<00:05:09.360> be<00:05:09.390> said<00:05:09.480> vice

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
and you can the same can be said vice

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.030 
and you can the same can be said vice
versa<00:05:10.380> but<00:05:11.100> they<00:05:11.220> both<00:05:11.430> uh<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:13.110> know<00:05:13.230> kind<00:05:13.950> of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
versa but they both uh you know kind of

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.650 
versa but they both uh you know kind of
they<00:05:14.670> just<00:05:14.880> do<00:05:15.000> exactly<00:05:15.390> what<00:05:15.510> they're

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
they just do exactly what they're

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.300 
they just do exactly what they're
supposed<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:15.990> do<00:05:16.140> and<00:05:16.290> just<00:05:16.440> it's<00:05:16.770> incredible

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
supposed to do and just it's incredible

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.950 
supposed to do and just it's incredible
instrument<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:18.000> just<00:05:18.210> had<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.510> chance<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.840> play

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
instrument I just had the chance to play

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.290 
instrument I just had the chance to play
this<00:05:19.140> you<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:19.920> ten<00:05:20.130> minutes<00:05:20.400> ago<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:21.210> I'm

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
this you know ten minutes ago and I'm

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.170 
this you know ten minutes ago and I'm
shocked<00:05:21.980> by<00:05:22.980> how<00:05:23.130> beautiful<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.670> is<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:24.030> mean

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
shocked by how beautiful it is I mean

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.930 
shocked by how beautiful it is I mean
just<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.630> it's<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.230> balanced<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.040> everything

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
just the it's so balanced and everything

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.700 
just the it's so balanced and everything
is<00:05:27.030> just<00:05:27.150> in<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.750> right<00:05:27.780> place<00:05:28.140> but<00:05:28.320> that's<00:05:28.530> me

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
is just in the right place but that's me

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.990 
is just in the right place but that's me
because<00:05:29.040> it's<00:05:29.220> kind<00:05:29.370> of<00:05:29.430> built<00:05:29.640> around<00:05:29.880> my

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
because it's kind of built around my

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.330 
because it's kind of built around my
specs<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:30.540> everything<00:05:30.900> kind<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.110> works<00:05:31.340> but

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
specs so everything kind of works but

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.460 
specs so everything kind of works but
it's<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:32.790> really<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:33.120> fantastic<00:05:33.810> new<00:05:34.020> version

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
it's it's really a fantastic new version

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.250 
it's it's really a fantastic new version
of<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.970> of<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.120> standard<00:05:36.480> series<00:05:36.750> series<00:05:36.990> too

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
of the of the standard series series too

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.160 
of the of the standard series series too
and<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.430> think<00:05:38.490> probably<00:05:39.390> the<00:05:39.750> best<00:05:39.900> thing<00:05:40.140> to

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
and I think probably the best thing to

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.590 
and I think probably the best thing to
do<00:05:40.380> is<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.590> let<00:05:40.710> Matt<00:05:40.950> play<00:05:40.980> it<00:05:41.400> he's<00:05:42.000> played

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
do is to let Matt play it he's played

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.720 
do is to let Matt play it he's played
one<00:05:42.840> tune<00:05:43.050> already<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.620> is<00:05:43.770> very<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.700> know

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
one tune already that is very you know

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.250 
one tune already that is very you know
very<00:05:45.090> matt<00:05:45.870> garrison<00:05:46.410> and<00:05:47.540> Matt's<00:05:48.540> music<00:05:49.050> I

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
very matt garrison and Matt's music I

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.780 
very matt garrison and Matt's music I
think<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:49.890> next<00:05:50.130> time<00:05:50.250> he's<00:05:50.400> going<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.550> take

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
think the next time he's going to take

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.670 
think the next time he's going to take
us<00:05:50.940> through<00:05:51.210> some<00:05:51.450> paces<00:05:51.690> in<00:05:52.080> terms<00:05:52.260> of<00:05:52.470> I

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
us through some paces in terms of I

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.410 
us through some paces in terms of I
think<00:05:53.580> it's<00:05:53.760> important<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.150> realize<00:05:54.390> that

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
think it's important to realize that

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.020 
think it's important to realize that
just<00:05:54.840> because<00:05:55.170> you<00:05:55.380> can<00:05:55.650> cop<00:05:55.920> the<00:05:56.580> kind<00:05:56.880> of

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
just because you can cop the kind of

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.580 
just because you can cop the kind of
tone<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.540> Matt's<00:05:57.780> become<00:05:58.170> very<00:05:58.380> well<00:05:58.560> known

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
tone that Matt's become very well known

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.920 
tone that Matt's become very well known
for<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.760> can<00:05:59.940> also<00:06:00.120> play<00:06:00.420> this<00:06:00.570> instrument

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
for you can also play this instrument

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.080 
for you can also play this instrument
