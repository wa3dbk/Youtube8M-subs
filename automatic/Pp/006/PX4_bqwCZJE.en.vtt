00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
map makers make the fireworks that

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.749 
map makers make the fireworks that
actually<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:26.289> know<00:00:26.410> fire<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.919> trail<00:00:27.429> and<00:00:27.640> then

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
actually you know fire a trail and then

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.370 
actually you know fire a trail and then
explode<00:00:28.210> for<00:00:28.390> example<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.779> see<00:00:28.960> little<00:00:29.109> drag

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
explode for example you see little drag

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.679 
explode for example you see little drag
nose<00:00:29.560> up<00:00:29.679> there<00:00:29.859> with<00:00:29.949> this<00:00:30.070> key<00:00:30.429> if<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:31.150> hit

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
nose up there with this key if I hit

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.290 
nose up there with this key if I hit
this<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:32.680> will<00:00:32.800> see<00:00:32.980> bang<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:33.789> that<00:00:33.969> is<00:00:34.149> the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
this you will see bang so that is the

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.790 
this you will see bang so that is the

other day on Twitch you would have
actually<00:00:40.360> seen<00:00:40.600> me<00:00:40.739> mess<00:00:41.739> around<00:00:41.890> with<00:00:42.190> a<00:00:42.219> set

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
actually seen me mess around with a set

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.920 
actually seen me mess around with a set
this<00:00:42.610> has<00:00:42.730> been<00:00:42.910> actually<00:00:43.300> something<00:00:43.750> I've

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
this has been actually something I've

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.299 
this has been actually something I've
been<00:00:44.050> playing<00:00:44.230> around<00:00:44.320> with<00:00:44.530> for<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.739> long<00:00:45.039> time

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
been playing around with for a long time

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.920 
been playing around with for a long time
now<00:00:45.789> this<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:45.969> obviously<00:00:46.420> I'm<00:00:46.570> not<00:00:46.780> claiming

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
now this is obviously I'm not claiming

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.540 
now this is obviously I'm not claiming
this<00:00:47.199> to<00:00:47.320> be<00:00:47.559> ever<00:00:47.680> invented<00:00:48.129> this<00:00:48.250> this<00:00:48.430> has

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
this to be ever invented this this has

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.779 
this to be ever invented this this has
been<00:00:48.730> used<00:00:48.910> by<00:00:49.030> by<00:00:49.300> many<00:00:49.600> many<00:00:49.809> people<00:00:50.789> quite

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
been used by by many many people quite

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.490 
been used by by many many people quite
often<00:00:51.969> what<00:00:52.210> they<00:00:52.329> actually<00:00:52.510> do<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:52.899> they<00:00:53.109> have

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
often what they actually do is they have

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.229 
often what they actually do is they have
spawn<00:00:53.920> as<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.309> spawn<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:54.940> that's<00:00:55.120> how<00:00:55.149> you

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
spawn as that spawn it so that's how you

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.299 
spawn as that spawn it so that's how you
would<00:00:55.539> have<00:00:55.719> done<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:56.109> with<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.949> old<00:00:57.100> high

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
would have done it with the old high

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.639 
would have done it with the old high
pixel<00:00:57.670> maps<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.120> recently<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:59.440> mapper

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
pixel maps and recently in the mapper

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.060 
pixel maps and recently in the mapper
worked<00:00:59.890> with<00:01:00.039> on<00:01:00.609> with<00:01:00.910> Kazim<00:01:01.829> casimir<00:01:02.829> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
worked with on with Kazim casimir the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.539 
worked with on with Kazim casimir the
reverie<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.360> up<00:01:04.509> reverie<00:01:05.439> really<00:01:06.189> the

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
reverie the up reverie really the

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.030 
reverie the up reverie really the
uprising<00:01:07.180> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:08.350> that's<00:01:08.500> how<00:01:08.619> they<00:01:08.650> did<00:01:08.920> it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
uprising I think that's how they did it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.249 
uprising I think that's how they did it
as<00:01:09.159> well<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.490> did<00:01:09.729> not<00:01:09.909> do<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.630> redstone<00:01:11.049> for

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
as well I did not do the redstone for

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.380 
as well I did not do the redstone for
that<00:01:11.439> map<00:01:11.619> just<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.920> be<00:01:12.100> very<00:01:12.250> clear<00:01:12.520> okay<00:01:13.180> I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
that map just to be very clear okay I

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.080 
that map just to be very clear okay I
just<00:01:13.600> had<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.619> was<00:01:15.220> brought<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.670> at<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.880> last

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
just had I was brought in at the last

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090 
just had I was brought in at the last
minute<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:17.020> just<00:01:17.229> did<00:01:17.350> some<00:01:17.380> mob<00:01:17.740> spawning

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
minute and I just did some mob spawning

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.740 
minute and I just did some mob spawning
like<00:01:18.369> I<00:01:18.490> mean<00:01:18.640> this<00:01:18.759> was<00:01:19.030> one<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.360> mobs<00:01:19.540> but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
like I mean this was one of the mobs but

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.149 
like I mean this was one of the mobs but
I've<00:01:19.900> just<00:01:19.930> changed<00:01:20.409> its<00:01:20.530> head<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.890> stuff

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
I've just changed its head and stuff

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.550 
I've just changed its head and stuff
okay<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:21.610> that's<00:01:21.909> just<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:23.110> under<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.409> name

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
okay so that's just and under the name

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.170 
okay so that's just and under the name
of<00:01:23.829> course<00:01:24.040> so<00:01:24.430> that's<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.759> only<00:01:24.850> thing<00:01:25.060> I've

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
of course so that's the only thing I've

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.560 
of course so that's the only thing I've
been<00:01:25.299> honored<00:01:25.450> but<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.740> did<00:01:27.579> kind<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.850> see<00:01:28.420> that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
been honored but I did kind of see that

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.969 
been honored but I did kind of see that
they<00:01:28.689> used<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.470> was<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:29.860> know

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
they used that and I was you know

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.560 
they used that and I was you know
curious<00:01:30.250> on<00:01:30.520> how<00:01:30.700> they<00:01:30.880> did<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:31.329> I<00:01:31.360> thought

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
curious on how they did it so I thought

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.539 
curious on how they did it so I thought
I'd<00:01:31.750> just<00:01:31.990> see<00:01:32.350> if<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.799> can<00:01:33.040> actually<00:01:33.189> replicate

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
I'd just see if I can actually replicate

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.149 
I'd just see if I can actually replicate
it<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.180> using<00:01:34.990> well<00:01:35.439> come<00:01:35.619> on<00:01:35.710> blocks<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.009> think

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
it in using well come on blocks I think

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.010 
it in using well come on blocks I think
they<00:01:36.250> use<00:01:36.399> come<00:01:36.579> on<00:01:36.700> blocks<00:01:36.880> as<00:01:37.030> well<00:01:37.240> okay<00:01:37.960> but

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
they use come on blocks as well okay but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.660 
they use come on blocks as well okay but
just<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.439> show<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.619> again<00:01:38.740> what<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.310> looks

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
just to show you again what that looks

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
just to show you again what that looks
like

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
like

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.530 
like
bang<00:01:41.350> I<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:42.009> love<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.369> effect<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.420> can

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
bang I just love that effect you can

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
basically what this is I'm just spawning

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.540 
basically what this is I'm just spawning
a<00:01:55.810> fireworks<00:01:56.810> entity<00:01:57.260> with<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.440> lifetime<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.130> a

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
a fireworks entity with a lifetime of a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.550 
a fireworks entity with a lifetime of a
negative<00:01:59.000> lifetime<00:01:59.690> which<00:01:59.870> means<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.350> going

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
negative lifetime which means it's going

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.940 
negative lifetime which means it's going
to<00:02:00.650> explode<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.790> second<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.870> spawn<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:03.830> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
to explode the second I spawn it so the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.190 
to explode the second I spawn it so the
moment<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.310> kind<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.610> spawn<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:06.020> will

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
moment I kind of spawn this it will

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.630 
moment I kind of spawn this it will
actually<00:02:06.560> explode<00:02:06.890> okay

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
actually explode okay

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.810 
actually explode okay
I'm<00:02:08.210> not<00:02:08.390> gonna<00:02:08.510> go<00:02:08.660> into<00:02:08.780> fireworks<00:02:09.820> because

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
I'm doing is I'm summoning it relative

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.460 
I'm doing is I'm summoning it relative
to<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:34.850> command<00:02:35.210> block<00:02:35.300> because<00:02:35.870> I'm<00:02:36.020> lazy

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
to this command block because I'm lazy

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.930 
to this command block because I'm lazy
okay<00:02:36.710> I'm<00:02:36.830> not<00:02:36.980> don't<00:02:37.340> want<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> get<00:02:37.640> out<00:02:37.760> and

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
okay I'm not don't want to get out and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.450 
okay I'm not don't want to get out and
test<00:02:38.240> out<00:02:38.450> where<00:02:38.720> all<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.200> blood<00:02:40.160> equal

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
test out where all of the blood equal

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.250 
test out where all of the blood equal
cohorts<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.300> what<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> where<00:02:42.230> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
cohorts is of what I want to where I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.660 
cohorts is of what I want to where I
wanted<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.650> sport<00:02:42.950> I'm<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.370> going<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:43.520> do<00:02:43.610> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
wanted to sport I'm just going to do it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.670 
wanted to sport I'm just going to do it
relative<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.140> three<00:02:45.470> so

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
relative so this is really the three so

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.580 
relative so this is really the three so
it<00:02:45.770> means<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.630> three<00:02:47.630> blocks<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:48.080> from<00:02:48.380> here

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
it means it is three blocks up from here

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.640 
it means it is three blocks up from here
okay<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.400> one<00:02:49.460> two<00:02:50.450> three<00:02:50.959> sets<00:02:51.320> it's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
okay so it's one two three sets it's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.740 
okay so it's one two three sets it's
gonna<00:02:51.800> spawn<00:02:52.130> right<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.940> block<00:02:53.270> see

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
gonna spawn right in that block see

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.250 
gonna spawn right in that block see
alright<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:55.459> one<00:02:55.640> IV<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.050> see

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
alright this one IV is for so if you see

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.610 
alright this one IV is for so if you see
it's<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.760> spawns<00:02:59.090> for<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.750> one<00:02:59.900> spawns<00:03:00.260> five

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
it's it spawns for this one spawns five

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.720 
it's it spawns for this one spawns five
this<00:03:01.310> one's<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.570> spawns<00:03:02.930> six<00:03:05.200> seven

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
this one's this one spawns six seven

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.210 
this one's this one spawns six seven
eight<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.450> eight<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.440> y

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
eight so this is eight on the y

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.250 
eight so this is eight on the y
coordinates<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.150> directly<00:03:11.600> apps<00:03:11.810> as<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.140> can

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
coordinates as directly apps as you can

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.190 
coordinates as directly apps as you can
see<00:03:12.440> over<00:03:12.620> here<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.550> directly<00:03:14.200> relative

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
see over here it is directly relative

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.979 
see over here it is directly relative
eight<00:03:15.560> up<00:03:15.860> from<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.880> command<00:03:17.360> block<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:17.900> this

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
eight up from this command block so this

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.660 
eight up from this command block so this
actually<00:03:18.350> does<00:03:18.470> make<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.800> much<00:03:19.070> easier<00:03:19.370> to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
actually does make it much easier to

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.199 
actually does make it much easier to
control<00:03:19.910> by<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:21.050> laying<00:03:21.440> down<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.860> line<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.370> of

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
control by just laying down a line of of

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.570 
control by just laying down a line of of
command<00:03:24.050> blocks<00:03:24.260> where<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.530> want<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.430> be

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
command blocks where you want it to be

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.729 
command blocks where you want it to be
and<00:03:25.820> then<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.750> know<00:03:26.959> firing<00:03:27.620> away

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
and then it just you know firing away

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.949 
and then it just you know firing away
and<00:03:28.070> then<00:03:28.519> right<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:28.970> end<00:03:29.209> all<00:03:29.540> I've<00:03:29.750> got

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
and then right in the end all I've got

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.650 
and then right in the end all I've got
over<00:03:30.140> here<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.739> prime<00:03:31.459> TNT<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:32.420> what<00:03:32.540> I'm<00:03:32.630> doing

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
over here is prime TNT so what I'm doing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.720 
over here is prime TNT so what I'm doing
is<00:03:32.870> I'm<00:03:33.050> actually<00:03:33.140> spawning<00:03:33.709> four<00:03:34.160> prime

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
is I'm actually spawning four prime

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.770 
is I'm actually spawning four prime
TNT's<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.730> creates<00:03:37.910> quite<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.510> nice

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
TNT's so that it creates quite a nice

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.340 
TNT's so that it creates quite a nice
big<00:03:39.290> bang<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:39.830> let<00:03:40.160> me<00:03:40.280> show<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.989> such<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> dress

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
big bang so let me show you such a dress

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.350 
big bang so let me show you such a dress
a<00:03:42.380> nice<00:03:42.709> big<00:03:43.100> big<00:03:43.310> bang<00:03:43.550> okay<00:03:44.269> bang<00:03:45.730> right<00:03:46.730> okay

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360

a nice big big bang okay bang right okay
so<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:48.050> then<00:03:48.110> what<00:03:48.650> these<00:03:48.950> are<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.610> just

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
so and then what these are this is just

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.729 
so and then what these are this is just
a<00:03:49.970> straightforward<00:03:50.239> set<00:03:50.750> block<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.380> I'm<00:03:51.560> just

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
a straightforward set block so I'm just

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.410 
a straightforward set block so I'm just
setting<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.130> block<00:03:52.340> or<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.580> stone<00:03:52.790> block<00:03:52.910> right

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
setting a block or a stone block right

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.809 
setting a block or a stone block right
over<00:03:53.690> here<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.200> then<00:03:54.620> what<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.280> moment<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.640> put

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
over here and then what the moment I put

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.910 
over here and then what the moment I put
the<00:03:55.970> block<00:03:56.180> down<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.720> block<00:03:56.990> over<00:03:57.170> here<00:03:57.319> has

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
the block down this block over here has

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.040 
the block down this block over here has
a<00:03:57.950> set<00:03:58.220> block<00:03:58.460> a<00:03:58.730> with<00:03:58.940> an<00:03:59.060> offset<00:03:59.270> of<00:03:59.569> minus

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
a set block a with an offset of minus

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.670 
a set block a with an offset of minus
one<00:04:00.380> which

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
one which

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.589 
one which
is<00:04:00.769> over<00:04:01.129> here<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.030> moment<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.329> put<00:04:02.540> this

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
is over here so the moment I put this

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.630 
is over here so the moment I put this
block<00:04:02.870> down<00:04:03.109> you'll<00:04:03.439> see<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:03.859> it<00:04:04.069> activates

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
block down you'll see this it activates

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.459 
block down you'll see this it activates
this<00:04:04.819> block<00:04:05.060> which<00:04:05.209> removes<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:05.840> but<00:04:06.230> just

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:06.469 
this block which removes it but just

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.740 
this block which removes it but just
just<00:04:07.189> right<00:04:07.609> after<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.090> actually<00:04:08.420> sent<00:04:08.629> a

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
just right after it actually sent a

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.599 
just right after it actually sent a
pulse<00:04:08.989> through<00:04:09.409> here<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.069> this<00:04:10.159> is<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> very

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
pulse through here so this is a very

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.789 
pulse through here so this is a very
nice<00:04:10.819> little<00:04:11.030> wireless<00:04:12.609> remote<00:04:14.319> wires<00:04:15.319> remote

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
nice little wireless remote wires remote

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.300 
nice little wireless remote wires remote

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
going to go into some but as I said I'm

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.180 
going to go into some but as I said I'm
not<00:04:20.959> gonna<00:04:21.109> go<00:04:21.199> into<00:04:21.380> detail<00:04:21.709> somebody<00:04:22.039> else

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
not gonna go into detail somebody else

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.770 
not gonna go into detail somebody else
has<00:04:22.310> done<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> much<00:04:22.699> better<00:04:22.850> video<00:04:23.180> than<00:04:23.210> than<00:04:23.660> I

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
has done a much better video than than I

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.540 
has done a much better video than than I
have<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.410> there's<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> seven<00:04:24.860> fireworks<00:04:25.250> rockin

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
have so there's a seven fireworks rockin

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.180 
have so there's a seven fireworks rockin
T<00:04:25.990> relative<00:04:26.990> three<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.680> come<00:04:27.889> on<00:04:28.009> block

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
T relative three to this come on block

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.040 
T relative three to this come on block
life<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.699> zero<00:04:29.030> ten<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.530> fireworks<00:04:30.979> item

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
life is zero ten and the fireworks item

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.890 
life is zero ten and the fireworks item
ID<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.289> 401<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.250> tag<00:04:34.550> is<00:04:34.849> fireworks<00:04:35.539> and<00:04:35.780> then

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
ID is 401 the tag is fireworks and then

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.990 
ID is 401 the tag is fireworks and then
the<00:04:36.050> explosion<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:36.830> then<00:04:36.949> the<00:04:37.340> explosion<00:04:37.820> has

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
the explosion and then the explosion has

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.939 
the explosion and then the explosion has
no<00:04:38.240> flicker<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.169> if<00:04:39.259> I<00:04:39.320> put<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.680> flicker

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
no flicker so if I put in a flicker

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.710 
no flicker so if I put in a flicker
it'll<00:04:40.220> make<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.550> flickering<00:04:41.060> crackly

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
it'll make like a flickering crackly

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.620 
it'll make like a flickering crackly
sound<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.650> trail<00:04:43.039> is<00:04:43.310> 10<00:04:43.669> so<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.150> can<00:04:44.300> see<00:04:44.479> the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
sound the trail is 10 so you can see the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.350 
sound the trail is 10 so you can see the
trail<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.199> can<00:04:45.229> see<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.620> trail<00:04:45.889> in<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:47.180> end

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
trail you can see the trail in the end

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.379 
trail you can see the trail in the end
see<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:47.990> little<00:04:48.229> Shh<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:49.130> they<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.030> trail<00:04:50.270> is

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
see the little Shh and they the trail is

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.510 
see the little Shh and they the trail is
gone<00:04:50.599> so<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.229> longer<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:51.590> put<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.979> the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
gone so the longer you put that the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.300 
gone so the longer you put that the
bigger<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:52.910> trail<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.330> going<00:04:53.479> to<00:04:53.660> be<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:55.070> type

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
bigger the trail is going to be the type

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.310 
bigger the trail is going to be the type
is<00:04:55.520> just<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:56.180> explosion<00:04:56.449> type<00:04:56.870> which<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.199> the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
is just the explosion type which is the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.920 
is just the explosion type which is the
circular<00:04:57.800> ball<00:04:58.099> right<00:04:58.940> if<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.270> change<00:04:59.599> the<00:04:59.720> type

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
circular ball right if I change the type

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.900 
circular ball right if I change the type
to<00:04:59.960> something<00:05:00.410> else<00:05:00.560> for<00:05:00.919> example<00:05:01.009> I<00:05:01.520> think

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
to something else for example I think

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.969 
to something else for example I think
let<00:05:02.330> me<00:05:02.389> see<00:05:02.570> if<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.750> can<00:05:02.840> get<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.199> for<00:05:03.470> now

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
let me see if I can get it to for now

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.070 
let me see if I can get it to for now
just<00:05:04.190> watch<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.669> one<00:05:04.729> this<00:05:05.570> particular<00:05:05.780> one

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
just watch this one this particular one

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.500 
just watch this one this particular one
over<00:05:06.590> yeah<00:05:07.099> see<00:05:07.849> now<00:05:07.880> it's<00:05:08.180> just<00:05:08.240> like<00:05:08.360> a

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
over yeah see now it's just like a

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.040 
over yeah see now it's just like a
little<00:05:08.810> poofy<00:05:09.620> little<00:05:10.150> but<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.240> poof<00:05:11.479> kind<00:05:11.960> of

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
little poofy little but the poof kind of

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.070 
little poofy little but the poof kind of
a<00:05:12.110> thing<00:05:12.289> okay<00:05:12.830> if<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.610> change<00:05:13.909> this<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.120> six<00:05:14.810> I

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
a thing okay if I change this to six I

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.300 
a thing okay if I change this to six I
think<00:05:15.320> there's<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.590> six<00:05:15.830> let's<00:05:16.039> have<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:16.159> look

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
think there's a six let's have a look

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.909 
think there's a six let's have a look

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
see that's a bit of a more of a blackish

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.370 
see that's a bit of a more of a blackish
that's<00:05:19.159> actually<00:05:19.370> not<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.490> bad<00:05:19.729> one<00:05:20.030> oh<00:05:20.380> it's

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
that's actually not a bad one oh it's

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.200 
that's actually not a bad one oh it's
maybe<00:05:21.620> yeah<00:05:21.830> this<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.370> bit<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.699> morph<00:05:22.880> atta

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
maybe yeah this is a bit of a morph atta

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.240 
maybe yeah this is a bit of a morph atta
boy<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.630> don't<00:05:23.720> know<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:24.080> just<00:05:24.710> go<00:05:24.889> watch<00:05:25.039> Ricky

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.310 
boy I don't know I just go watch Ricky
Billy's<00:05:25.520> think<00:05:25.699> I'm<00:05:26.120> I'm<00:05:26.570> not<00:05:26.810> gonna<00:05:27.050> go<00:05:27.139> into

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
Billy's think I'm I'm not gonna go into

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.960 
Billy's think I'm I'm not gonna go into
this<00:05:27.409> and<00:05:27.620> then<00:05:28.099> last<00:05:28.310> but<00:05:28.430> not<00:05:28.550> least<00:05:28.789> just

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
this and then last but not least just

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.860 
this and then last but not least just
the<00:05:29.060> colour<00:05:29.389> so<00:05:29.630> this<00:05:29.750> is<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.990> colour<00:05:30.199> black

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
the colour so this is the colour black

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.810 
the colour so this is the colour black
for<00:05:32.870> this<00:05:33.190> okay<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.280> then<00:05:34.370> I've<00:05:34.460> just<00:05:34.490> got<00:05:34.669> a

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
for this okay and then I've just got a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.550 
for this okay and then I've just got a
repeater<00:05:35.210> set<00:05:35.449> up<00:05:35.539> now<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:36.139> nice<00:05:36.289> thing<00:05:36.320> about

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
repeater set up now the nice thing about

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.560 
repeater set up now the nice thing about
this<00:05:36.800> at<00:05:37.190> any<00:05:37.370> time<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.580> can<00:05:37.759> just<00:05:37.909> go<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.360> go

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
this at any time I can just go and go

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.600 
this at any time I can just go and go
and<00:05:38.599> fiddle<00:05:39.139> with<00:05:39.409> the<00:05:39.740> actual<00:05:40.099> timing<00:05:40.340> so<00:05:40.550> I'm

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
and fiddle with the actual timing so I'm

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.370 
and fiddle with the actual timing so I'm
gonna<00:05:40.789> put<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.030> timing<00:05:41.360> slightly<00:05:42.050> different

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
gonna put the timing slightly different

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.230 
gonna put the timing slightly different
so<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.530> can<00:05:42.650> actually<00:05:42.889> see<00:05:43.070> what<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.820> effect

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
so you can actually see what the effect

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.879 
so you can actually see what the effect
of<00:05:44.389> those<00:05:44.599> that<00:05:45.050> timing<00:05:45.409> will<00:05:45.500> be<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:45.740> let<00:05:45.830> me

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
of those that timing will be so let me

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.260 
of those that timing will be so let me
just<00:05:46.009> get<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.430> little<00:05:46.490> dragon<00:05:46.880> nose<00:05:46.970> up<00:05:47.120> there

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
just get a little dragon nose up there

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.980 
just get a little dragon nose up there
pew<00:05:47.630> okay<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.770> then<00:05:48.919> just<00:05:48.949> look<00:05:49.280> at<00:05:49.400> this<00:05:49.840> oops

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
pew okay and then just look at this oops

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.690 
pew okay and then just look at this oops
look<00:05:51.259> at<00:05:51.380> this

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.060 

so<00:05:54.330> it's<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.540> very<00:05:54.780> very<00:05:55.290> different<00:05:55.620> effect

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
so it's a very very different effect

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.330 
so it's a very very different effect
this<00:05:56.250> time<00:05:57.140> because<00:05:58.140> it's<00:05:58.290> not<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.710> fast<00:05:59.010> so<00:05:59.280> if

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
this time because it's not so fast so if

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.870 
this time because it's not so fast so if
I<00:05:59.460> now<00:05:59.730> just<00:06:00.000> make<00:06:00.150> it<00:06:00.240> even<00:06:00.330> more<00:06:00.450> slower<00:06:04.880> okay

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
I now just make it even more slower okay

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:14.180 
I now just make it even more slower okay
and<00:06:11.630> that's<00:06:12.630> more<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:12.960> like<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.140> creeping<00:06:13.710> it's

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
and that's more of like a creeping it's

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.500 
and that's more of like a creeping it's
like<00:06:14.400> creeping<00:06:14.760> up<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.060> oh<00:06:15.090> yeah<00:06:15.360> I'm
