sign<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.940> NDA<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> wasn't<00:00:52.050> expecting<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
sign an NDA that I wasn't expecting I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.260 
sign an NDA that I wasn't expecting I
was<00:00:52.860> expecting<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.430> we'd<00:00:53.579> end<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.879> warm<00:00:54.149> with

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
was expecting that we'd end up warm with

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
was expecting that we'd end up warm with
like<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> press<00:00:55.140> beta<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:55.920> would<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
like a press beta which would have

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.660 
like a press beta which would have
actually<00:00:56.370> made<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:57.239> sense<00:00:58.219> considering<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
actually made some sense considering of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
actually made some sense considering of
how<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.030> acquired<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.840> beta<00:01:00.989> code<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.590> was

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
how we acquired the beta code which was

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.940 
how we acquired the beta code which was
by<00:01:02.250> spreading<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.090> around<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:06.060> know

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
by spreading it around and that you know

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.840 
by spreading it around and that you know
first<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> eight<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.340> probably<00:01:08.549> let<00:01:08.700> us

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
first of eight it would probably let us

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
first of eight it would probably let us
do<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.619> no<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> basically<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
do that more but no we basically have a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120 
do that more but no we basically have a
game<00:01:11.580> tester<00:01:11.909> beta<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:13.350> means<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.860> we're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
game tester beta which means that we're

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
game tester beta which means that we're
locked<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.820> an<00:01:14.970> NDA<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.900> can't<00:01:16.290> make
