00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 welcome to the next couple 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.299
 by pokémon xy this time i have myself 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 again for bombardier and red 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 decided with bieber and gartow too 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.719
 19 to come to the opponent players 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.660
 elizabeth pension towers as right 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 normally heavy I would have to say 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.970
 I then sick pokémon or one 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.170
 Doll with a fight attack distress 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.050
 Let's get started 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.740
 because maybe he is not that way 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 uninteresting 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.350
 the opponent of the fight was really one 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 despite being in over-charged normal 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.600
 pokémon i ask with bibo 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.879
 adversary with taurus what stupidly the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 ability metro did that to me 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.430
 not fit in the junk 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 that's why I had to say okay but you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.989
 you're back all dear 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.910
 or always has to go back but he has good 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.710
 done harm anyway threaten so there 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.449
 I have to say respect for it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.399
 that it's actually from the gardeners 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.719
 not so strong a book is and then comes 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.229
 he breaks down the book he is 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.810
 somehow can not stand jogi 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.250
 makes me extremely hurt 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 and I want to turn it around the cd 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 i just want to make out of the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.799
 metro it would be too much and that does too 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 keyboard seems very good 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.630
 is really great will probably not there 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.540
 maybe you would have even said that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.450
 can now seriously damage kompanie 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.930
 with flails which hardly hurt us 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.930
 do there 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.360
 now with grant I found that 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.170
 I did not like that advice 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.410
 It does not shine me that often anymore 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.240
 fortunately our rotenburg ii is infected 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.300
 the easy way I really wanted 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.440
 First you do not use it because of me 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.750
 I do not know why I thought he was 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.500
 may switch again but then 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.410
 I have to be honest again 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.910
 I wanted another one 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.900
 attack of pandi off so I get 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.990
 who can endure 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:00.450
 then turn off with word change 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 can or yes it can be yes focus with me 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.650
 not much harm first it can be 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.270
 that i have used recovery exactly 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.690
 I'm still holding up 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.070
 wanted 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.710
 I have a red recovery 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.740
 taught plus maroh and would be with it 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.000
 just full of coffee again 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.740
 is refueled and I now with wolf 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.980
 either I make the exit 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.980
 can 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.739
 went there now first 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.580
 professional can even come back here again 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.660
 with committee failed if i now 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.709
 Let's be away so we just first 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.709
 can pull red from the sling 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.459
 and thus also my cable was changed 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:52.220
 the pokemon I will go first 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.920
 Stop the megaphone and I believe it 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.349
 now comes first with thunder lightning 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.470
 exactly does a lot of harm 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.500
 but not enough 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.390
 and our mode of violence would have to do that 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.390
 definitely kill pokémon 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.019
 and yes, then it will be around 1 o'clock 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.480
 weakened pandya and a gate from the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.830
 Unfortunately, we have to plug in opel 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.350
 there is no way around it 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.700
 but well with the next one 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.720
 i would have burned animal dying 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.490
 I just think I'm doing 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.100
 thoughtless and I even got it right 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.140
 I used to be predicted as a dip 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.130
 not counting now but me 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.390
 thought to me 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.740
 he will probably do something 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.250
 make him beat me fast 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.840
 can 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.240
 so you can eat slowly because of that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.430
 I've used thought and the 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.630
 Snake was very good for me 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.630
 I could just blow that up now 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.750
 then he comes back with towers 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.310
 I thought so well my initiative 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.400
 will probably not be enough and yes 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.820
 unfortunately he comes home with numbers 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.670
 What you can not bear, I'm sorry 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.170
 would have liked to use blown well 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 then of course I also got one 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.730
 I also really wanted him 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.930
 insert and have chosen team 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.520
 the damage on sand also has good 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.020
 made and even created 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.300
 poisoned but there it was no more 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.100
 necessary because the against laws 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.739
 First it can be snowing that ours 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.120
 Of course, Bieber does not stop but we 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.320
 have indeed still proton behind 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.690
 with full coffee and yes I would say 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.260
 that is actually clear for us 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.380
 match no matter what uses ours 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.910
 Red will be your life for a tiger 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.140
 shock and are still very good 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.800
 It would not have been a direct hit 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.660
 but survives 41 kp are already enough 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.850
 and the wolf change has thus the house 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.380
 even defeated we have the match 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.880
 Decided for us I like mine 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.880
 favorite pokemon and so I see
