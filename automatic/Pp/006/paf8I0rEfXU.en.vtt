on<00:00:04.360> this<00:00:04.569> 82<00:00:05.140> 44<00:00:05.649> love<00:00:06.580> the<00:00:06.729> salt<00:00:06.970> in<00:00:07.120> here

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.320 
on this 82 44 love the salt in here

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.230 
on this 82 44 love the salt in here
because<00:00:08.320> it's<00:00:08.530> so<00:00:08.680> repairable<00:00:09.340> and<00:00:09.490> it's<00:00:10.120> a

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
because it's so repairable and it's a

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.990 
because it's so repairable and it's a
very<00:00:10.450> good<00:00:10.570> out<00:00:10.690> there<00:00:10.900> on<00:00:11.110> your<00:00:11.320> later<00:00:12.000> 2006

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
very good out there on your later 2006

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.830

and<00:00:13.240> up<00:00:13.540> GM<00:00:13.930> vehicles<00:00:14.380> that<00:00:15.070> have<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.840> they've

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
and up GM vehicles that have the they've

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.980 
and up GM vehicles that have the they've
got<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.310> a4<00:00:18.310> I<00:00:18.640> mean<00:00:19.150> they<00:00:19.300> go<00:00:19.449> from<00:00:19.599> the<00:00:19.720> four

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
got the a4 I mean they go from the four

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.550 
got the a4 I mean they go from the four

will<00:01:40.000> blow<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.480> regulator<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.710> to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
will blow the regulator so you have to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.300 
will blow the regulator so you have to

have a resistor it on these these has an

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.520 
have a resistor it on these these has an
L<00:01:45.460> terminal<00:01:45.850> on<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.540> starts<00:01:46.900> at<00:01:47.110> going

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
L terminal on it and it starts at going

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.440 
L terminal on it and it starts at going
but<00:01:48.010> once<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.340> gets<00:01:48.430> going<00:01:48.850> it's<00:01:48.970> got<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.330> get

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
but once it gets going it's got to get

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.180 
but once it gets going it's got to get
that<00:01:49.630> signal<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:50.230> got<00:01:50.350> an<00:01:50.440> F<00:01:50.590> terminal<00:01:51.070> and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
that signal it's got an F terminal and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.950 
that signal it's got an F terminal and

default or limp mode and you won't get
full<00:02:01.870> output<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:02.440> get<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.710> lot<00:02:02.980> of<00:02:03.010> calls<00:02:03.310> from

in the Hat if you've got a two pin type
regulator<00:02:20.620> around<00:02:20.830> I'll<00:02:21.159> 2006<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.090> newer<00:02:22.269> motor

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
regulator around I'll 2006 a newer motor

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.830 
will not work you're going to have to
either<00:02:26.890> convert<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.239> pin<00:02:28.450> regulator

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
either convert that to pin regulator

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.050 
either convert that to pin regulator
over<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.349> four<00:02:29.650> pin<00:02:29.829> regulator<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.670> that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
over to a four pin regulator and that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.970 
over to a four pin regulator and that
can<00:02:31.269> be<00:02:31.420> done<00:02:31.599> because<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.959> configuration<00:02:32.799> of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
can be done because the configuration of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.630 
can be done because the configuration of
the<00:02:33.489> 84<00:02:34.420> pin<00:02:34.629> regulator<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.430> really<00:02:36.430> really

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the 84 pin regulator is really really

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.009 
the 84 pin regulator is really really
similar<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.420> pin

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
similar to pin

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.770 
similar to pin
it's<00:02:38.409> just<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.799> under<00:02:39.220> one<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.549> these

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's just that under one of these

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.119 
it's just that under one of these
there's<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.870> when<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.590> go<00:02:41.739> from<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:43.920> two<00:02:44.920> pin

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
there's a when you go from the two pin

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.649 
there's a when you go from the two pin
regulator<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.730> four<00:02:46.000> pin<00:02:46.209> regulator

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
regulator to a four pin regulator

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.960 
regulator to a four pin regulator
there's<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.989> little<00:02:47.200> knob<00:02:47.409> up<00:02:47.709> an<00:02:47.829> oven<00:02:48.549> up

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
there's a little knob up an oven up

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.369 
there's a little knob up an oven up
underneath<00:02:49.359> here<00:02:49.659> that<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:49.989> have<00:02:50.349> to

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
underneath here that you just have to

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.349 
underneath here that you just have to
trim<00:02:50.859> off<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.069> little<00:02:51.220> bit<00:02:51.579> to<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.090> able<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.239> get

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
trim off a little bit to be able to get

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.630 
trim off a little bit to be able to get
that<00:02:52.510> regulators<00:02:53.049> sit<00:02:53.349> in<00:02:53.500> there<00:02:53.620> level<00:02:54.010> but

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
that regulators sit in there level but

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.160 
that regulators sit in there level but
this<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.970> absolutely<00:02:55.540> an<00:02:55.629> excellent

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
this is absolutely an excellent

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.869 
this is absolutely an excellent
alternator<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.430> said<00:02:57.639> they<00:02:57.760> were

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
alternator for like I said they were

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.720 
alternator for like I said they were
snowplows<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.889> off-road<00:02:59.889> vehicles<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.489> four

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
snowplows and off-road vehicles in four

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.819 
snowplows and off-road vehicles in four
four<00:03:01.239> by<00:03:01.389> fours<00:03:01.659> it's<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.109> great<00:03:02.560> great

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
four by fours it's a great great

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.920 
four by fours it's a great great
alternator<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.579> it's<00:03:04.150> definitely<00:03:04.629> would<00:03:04.900> be

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
alternator and it's definitely would be

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.960 
alternator and it's definitely would be
highly<00:03:05.440> recommended<00:03:06.099> well<00:03:06.430> like<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.700> say<00:03:06.849> we

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
highly recommended well like I say we

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.670 
highly recommended well like I say we
have<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.269> dual<00:03:07.510> rectifier<00:03:08.049> version<00:03:08.530> and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
have in the dual rectifier version and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.800 
have in the dual rectifier version and
that's<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.280> ad<00:03:10.620> 244<00:03:11.620> series<00:03:12.099> out<00:03:12.280> there<00:03:12.810> it's

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
that's the ad 244 series out there it's

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.769 
that's the ad 244 series out there it's
a<00:03:13.989> great<00:03:14.139> alternator
