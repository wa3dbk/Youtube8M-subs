for<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.550> while<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.660> became<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:51.989> of

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
for a while and so that became one of

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.660 
for a while and so that became one of
her<00:01:52.140> drills<00:01:52.410> was<00:01:52.649> she<00:01:53.130> started<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> feel<00:01:53.489> bad

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
her drills was she started to feel bad

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.749 
her drills was she started to feel bad
again<00:01:53.819> juggle<00:01:54.479> was<00:01:54.660> amazing<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.979> years<00:01:56.429> later

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
again juggle was amazing now years later

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
again juggle was amazing now years later
we<00:01:57.030> probably<00:01:57.330> have<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.720> lot<00:01:57.959> more<00:01:58.200> information

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
we probably have a lot more information

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.040 
we probably have a lot more information
about<00:01:58.950> why<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.459> happens<00:01:59.849> if<00:02:00.090> you've<00:02:00.599> heard

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
about why that happens if you've heard

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.080 
about why that happens if you've heard
the<00:02:01.289> Zeile<00:02:01.470> lecture<00:02:02.099> around<00:02:02.429> pain<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.940> talked

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the Zeile lecture around pain we talked

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.219 
the Zeile lecture around pain we talked
about<00:02:03.209> this<00:02:03.360> idea<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:03.720> we<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.929> threat

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
about this idea that we have a threat

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.290 
about this idea that we have a threat
bucket<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.580> idea<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.060> there's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
bucket and then the idea is that there's

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.029 
bucket and then the idea is that there's
this<00:02:06.599> big<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.080> call<00:02:07.229> super<00:02:07.500> system<00:02:07.890> in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this big what we call super system in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
this big what we call super system in
the<00:02:08.099> brain<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.970> taking<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.630> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the brain that's taking in all the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.410 
the brain that's taking in all the
available<00:02:10.410> input<00:02:10.760> coming<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.970> from<00:02:12.180> our<00:02:12.239> eyes

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
available input coming in from our eyes

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.630 
available input coming in from our eyes
from<00:02:13.290> our<00:02:13.440> inner<00:02:13.650> ear<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> rest<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.550> our

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
from our inner ear from the rest of our

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.150 
from our inner ear from the rest of our
body<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.750> judging<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.620> based<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.010> how

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
body and it's judging that based on how

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.380 
body and it's judging that based on how
threatening<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.060> things<00:02:18.180> are

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
threatening it is and if things are

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.790 
threatening it is and if things are
really<00:02:18.569> threatening<00:02:18.959> very<00:02:19.319> often<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
really threatening very often the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.170 
really threatening very often the
response<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> brain<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> give<00:02:21.120> you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
response of the brain is to give you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.000 
response of the brain is to give you
some<00:02:21.330> pain

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
some pain

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.289 
some pain
in<00:02:22.250> order<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.489> make<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.760> alter<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.090> behavior

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
in order to make you alter your behavior

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.869 
in order to make you alter your behavior
now<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.620> going<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.799> take<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.069> little<00:02:25.370> sidetrack

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
now I'm going to take a little sidetrack

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.429 
now I'm going to take a little sidetrack
from<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.510> talk<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> little<00:02:27.230> bit<00:02:27.409> about

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
from that and talk a little bit about

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.890 
from that and talk a little bit about
meditation<00:02:28.129> one<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> big<00:02:29.299> things<00:02:29.720> is

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
meditation one of the big things is

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.330 
meditation one of the big things is
happening<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.379> chronic<00:02:30.709> pain<00:02:30.739> world<00:02:31.129> right

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
happening the chronic pain world right

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.559 
happening the chronic pain world right
now<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.790> looking<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.269> what's<00:02:32.420> called

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
now is looking at what's called

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.720 
now is looking at what's called
mindfulness<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.439> meditation<00:02:33.950> because

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
mindfulness and meditation because

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.000 
mindfulness and meditation because
meditation<00:02:34.900> increases<00:02:35.900> activity<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.920> a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
meditation increases activity in a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.309 
meditation increases activity in a
variety<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> areas<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.329> brain<00:02:38.450> one

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
variety of the areas of the brain one

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.050 
variety of the areas of the brain one
particular<00:02:39.829> place<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.700> particularly

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
particular place in in particularly

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.509 
particular place in in particularly
called<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> insular<00:02:42.049> cortex<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.829> in<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
called the insular cortex and in the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.210 
called the insular cortex and in the
insula<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.269> believe<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:45.019> an<00:02:45.230> area<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.739> kind

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
insula we believe is an area that kind

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.720 
insula we believe is an area that kind
of<00:02:46.310> controls<00:02:46.819> how<00:02:47.629> bad<00:02:47.959> pain<00:02:48.409> feels<00:02:48.859> and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
of controls how bad pain feels and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.520 
of controls how bad pain feels and
what's<00:02:49.939> been<00:02:50.090> found<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.689> in<00:02:50.870> chronic

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
what's been found is that in chronic

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.020 
what's been found is that in chronic
meditators<00:02:52.189> people<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.579> have<00:02:52.670> meditated

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
meditators people that have meditated

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.970 
meditators people that have meditated
for<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.299> long<00:02:53.450> time<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:54.019> good<00:02:54.200> at<00:02:54.379> it<00:02:54.530> it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
for a long time and are good at it it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.349 
for a long time and are good at it it
really<00:02:55.159> changes<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.730> activity<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
really changes the activity in the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.629 
really changes the activity in the
insula<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.290> in<00:02:57.409> fact<00:02:57.650> they<00:02:57.889> become<00:02:58.220> more<00:02:58.400> pain

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
insula and in fact they become more pain

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.940 
insula and in fact they become more pain
resistant<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.900> there<00:03:00.109> was<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> great<00:03:00.500> study

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
resistant now there was a great study

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.789 
resistant now there was a great study
that<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.519> believe<00:03:01.879> helps<00:03:02.209> explain<00:03:02.480> why<00:03:02.799> leather

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
that I believe helps explain why leather

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.069 
that I believe helps explain why leather
ball<00:03:03.980> caching<00:03:04.430> may<00:03:04.849> actually<00:03:05.060> be<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> form<00:03:05.959> of

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
ball caching may actually be a form of

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.289 
ball caching may actually be a form of
moving<00:03:06.500> meditation<00:03:06.909> because<00:03:07.909> when<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.120> look

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
moving meditation because when you look

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.550 
moving meditation because when you look
at<00:03:08.420> people<00:03:08.629> who<00:03:08.840> are<00:03:09.049> trying<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.439> use

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
at people who are trying to use

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.199 
at people who are trying to use
meditation<00:03:09.829> to<00:03:10.189> control<00:03:10.519> pain<00:03:10.700> there<00:03:11.000> are<00:03:11.060> two

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
meditation to control pain there are two

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.270 
meditation to control pain there are two
different<00:03:11.480> groups<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:12.379> have<00:03:12.530> new<00:03:12.680> people<00:03:12.889> and

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
different groups you have new people and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.009 
different groups you have new people and
you<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:13.760> people<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:14.569> been<00:03:14.659> doing<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:14.959> a

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
you have people have been doing in a

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.110 
you have people have been doing in a
while<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:16.250> way<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.760> they<00:03:16.879> need<00:03:17.090> to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
while and the way that they need to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.319 
while and the way that they need to
meditate<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.810> different<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:20.000> people<00:03:20.299> that

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
meditate is different in the people that

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.640 
meditate is different in the people that
have<00:03:20.510> been<00:03:20.599> meditating<00:03:20.810> for<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.200> long<00:03:21.349> time

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
have been meditating for a long time

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.500 
have been meditating for a long time
they<00:03:22.069> actually<00:03:22.489> do<00:03:22.670> very<00:03:22.909> well<00:03:23.030> within

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
they actually do very well within

generally guessing where the ball is
going<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.280> be<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.729> have<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.299> follow<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.690> track<00:04:06.109> it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
going to be I have to follow it track it

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.619 
going to be I have to follow it track it
as<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.470> comes<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:06.919> and<00:04:07.250> catch<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.359> call<00:04:08.540> the

as it comes in and catch it and call the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.420 
as it comes in and catch it and call the
letter<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.199> very<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.769> sense<00:04:10.040> simple

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
letter it's a very like a sense simple

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.210 
letter it's a very like a sense simple
form<00:04:10.729> in<00:04:11.060> my<00:04:11.479> mind<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.930> moving<00:04:12.260> meditation<00:04:12.769> or

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
form in my mind of moving meditation or

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.069 
form in my mind of moving meditation or
mindfulness<00:04:13.669> training<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.599> again<00:04:14.840> there's<00:04:15.019> a

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
mindfulness training and again there's a

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.599 
mindfulness training and again there's a
lot<00:04:15.229> of<00:04:15.409> cool<00:04:15.590> research<00:04:15.919> about<00:04:16.220> how<00:04:16.280> that

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
lot of cool research about how that

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.920 
lot of cool research about how that
impacts<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.269> threat<00:04:17.510> bucket<00:04:17.780> in<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
impacts in this threat bucket in the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.199 
impacts in this threat bucket in the
brain<00:04:18.250> decreases<00:04:19.250> overall<00:04:19.489> threat<00:04:19.880> and

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
brain decreases overall threat and

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.990 
brain decreases overall threat and
decreases<00:04:21.169> pain<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.340> lot<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.669> people<00:04:22.880> when

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
decreases pain so a lot of people when

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.550 
decreases pain so a lot of people when
they<00:04:23.030> saw<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.479> Facebook<00:04:23.930> post<00:04:24.080> we're<00:04:24.349> asking

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
they saw that Facebook post we're asking

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.779 
they saw that Facebook post we're asking
some<00:04:24.710> questions<00:04:25.039> like<00:04:25.159> that's<00:04:25.370> really<00:04:25.639> weird

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
some questions like that's really weird

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:26.680 
some questions like that's really weird
how<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.210> heck<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
how in the heck is

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.840 
how in the heck is
work<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.800> some<00:04:27.980> degree<00:04:28.250> we<00:04:28.460> can't<00:04:28.670> go

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
work and to some degree we can't go

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.580 
work and to some degree we can't go
here's<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.540> one<00:04:29.690> research<00:04:29.990> study<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.290> proves

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
here's the one research study to proves

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.170 
here's the one research study to proves
it<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.250> there's<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.430> lot<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.670> stuff<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.090> we

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
it but there's a lot of stuff that we

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.150 
it but there's a lot of stuff that we
can<00:04:32.330> look<00:04:32.450> at<00:04:32.600> that's<00:04:32.750> associated<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.920> we<00:04:33.980> make

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
can look at that's associated so we make

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.120 
can look at that's associated so we make
some<00:04:34.310> pretty<00:04:34.520> good<00:04:34.640> theoretical<00:04:36.040> guesses<00:04:37.040> if

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
some pretty good theoretical guesses if

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.610 
some pretty good theoretical guesses if
you<00:04:37.250> were<00:04:37.340> open<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.630> why<00:04:38.840> this<00:04:38.900> works<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.470> why

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
you were open and why this works and why

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.200 
you were open and why this works and why
it's<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:39.920> powerful<00:04:40.100> for<00:04:40.370> so<00:04:40.580> many<00:04:40.670> people<00:04:40.910> so

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
it's so powerful for so many people so

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.520 
it's so powerful for so many people so
if<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.690> haven't<00:04:41.930> given<00:04:42.170> letter<00:04:42.380> ball

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530

implement<00:04:56.570> in<00:04:56.810> people's<00:04:57.080> lives<00:04:57.320> there's<00:04:57.590> no

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
implement in people's lives there's no

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.380 
implement in people's lives there's no
reason<00:04:58.100> for<00:04:58.370> people<00:04:58.760> have<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.940> know<00:04:59.060> about<00:04:59.150> it

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
reason for people have to know about it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.330 
reason for people have to know about it
so<00:04:59.540> if<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.530> have<00:05:00.620> any<00:05:00.740> questions<00:05:01.070> let<00:05:01.190> us<00:05:01.220> know

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
so if you have any questions let us know

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:19.890 
so if you have any questions let us know
otherwise<00:05:01.700> good<00:05:02.000> luck

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.869 

remember<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:21.020> program<00:05:21.699> juggling<00:05:22.699> for

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
remember that program juggling for

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.379 
remember that program juggling for
dummies<00:05:23.680> apparently<00:05:24.680> not<00:05:24.830> for<00:05:24.860> dummies<00:05:25.389> for

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389
