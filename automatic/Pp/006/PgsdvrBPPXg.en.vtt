00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.160
 Critical videos or video takes well 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.600
 controversial 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.439
 everyone who has the right to say no 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.439
 up there 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:43.489
 the computer and wave that needs a 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.150
 I have it, let's see this 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.160
 is a computer armed gentlemen this 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.220
 I say it's a cheaper computer of the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.890
 that normal 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.890
 and at a very affordable cost this is what 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.020
 that I use to be able to record my 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.750
 videos supports minecraft and all that and I 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.140
 this ix goes very well as you can see is 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.120
 a card 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.640
 that has hybrid graphics this one has 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.670
 pci-express in the 3d turbo system 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 has a bunch of fans and good 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.180
 it's a phenom 4 processor 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.940
 is the strongest of the md and good the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.490
 Life card is high definition 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.410
 has 42 ram memory and avoiding more 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.980
 I have 3 but I'm going to finish with 12 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.630
 gb of ram 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.110
 and well the hard drive of a 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.850
 terabyte this normal citibank not what 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 What is needed 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.630
 what I'm going to do, how important is it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.110
 edify when when they grab a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.840
 computer 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.150
 the run to run games render 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.120
 videos and all that have to walk so 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.290
 less a little more than 6 gigas this that 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.080
 have a speed card for 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.610
 graphics processing that is way 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.230
 you can not get high definition 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.390
 if you look here back has 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.740
 hdmi input that is more this is not 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.540
 with what he recorded with what was was a 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.770
 capturing that is already that one of that 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.440
 is the processing of the process is very 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.450
 important because they are four cores 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.910
 this pulls three points arrive if you 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.100
 allows more ability to handle 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.650
 tasks at the same time as per say 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.310
 record this render upload videos 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.930
 be talking etcetera not many about 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.250
 everything helps you more to render because the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.370
 rendering of a minecraft video 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.220
 usually half an hour 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.170
 it takes me about an hour 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.540
 imagine yourself with a worse fucking computer 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.030
 the fuck and the coolest gentlemen of 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.510
 all this that you see here from a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.730
 perfect computer I got 6500 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.200
 pesos 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.849
 all that is the cabinet the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.909
 fans mother card source 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.370
 power chingÃ³n et cetera all for six thousand 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:59.360
 five hundred pesos is 550 dollars lords 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.159
 and it has a chingona supercomputer not 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.530
 you need more no longer adding a 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.160
 keyboard anyone click keyboard and a 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.709
 culero mouse and the monitor and ready 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.180
 where they are more race so your good 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.150
 It's a short video but I wanted them 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.349
 teach what fart all the chaos I'm 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.349
 right now we will proceed 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.520
 this 4 gigabyte ram card 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.830
 so that you find more what you already 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.270
 I will tell later that fart and good recite 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.550
 I hope you have an idea 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.960
 this is the one I bought in mercadolibre no 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.250
 necessary to look in large part for 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.970
 you and a friend who knows them 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.220
 computers to form them well I 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:45.170
 I think that there is no problem is a 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.150
 mother card this ht 30 according to me 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.620
 and good saves a lot of energy is 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.480
 important because there are fields 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.010
 warm up and even if it does not heat up 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.750
 as much as you want everything is protected 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.000
 with fans is very important 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.700
 then you can melt the fart this 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.050
 leaves lying good bastard and you ready 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.140
 recite see you 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.680
 and the race that in the video of hector 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.109
 I also have the right to say it 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.420
 I say is not that the result and now yes 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.459
 that 's my way of talking 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.670
 Testoni but give us resist our 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.670
 video
