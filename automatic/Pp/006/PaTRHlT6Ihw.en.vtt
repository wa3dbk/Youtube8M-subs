another and then when everybody is dead

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.270 
another and then when everybody is dead
then<00:05:09.420> Nats<00:05:09.690> game<00:05:09.990> over<00:05:10.320> it's<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.860> pretty<00:05:11.010> cool

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
then Nats game over it's a pretty cool

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.220 
then Nats game over it's a pretty cool
approach<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.940> game<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.360> type<00:05:12.420> even

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
approach for a game of this type even

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.750 
approach for a game of this type even
cooler<00:05:13.470> is<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.950> each<00:05:14.130> character<00:05:14.460> has<00:05:14.610> their

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
cooler is that each character has their

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:24.140 
cooler is that each character has their
own<00:05:14.970> stats<00:05:15.480> you<00:05:15.690> can<00:05:15.840> upgrade<00:05:16.020> over<00:05:16.410> time

biggest change to the gameplay is that

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.870

stick<00:06:18.039> shooters<00:06:18.370> this<00:06:18.699> made<00:06:18.880> me<00:06:19.000> pretty<00:06:19.210> happy

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
stick shooters this made me pretty happy

it<00:06:20.020> really<00:06:20.229> helps<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.590> flow<00:06:20.830> and<00:06:21.070> finesse<00:06:21.370> of

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.310 
it really helps the flow and finesse of
the<00:06:21.580> action<00:06:21.970> if<00:06:22.120> not<00:06:22.840> making<00:06:23.199> it

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
the action if not making it

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.310 
the action if not making it
significantly<00:06:23.560> easier<00:06:24.280> overall

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
significantly easier overall

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
significantly easier overall
unfortunately<00:06:26.320> beyond<00:06:26.650> that<00:06:26.860> there's<00:06:27.220> not

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
unfortunately beyond that there's not

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.980 
unfortunately beyond that there's not
much<00:06:27.550> in<00:06:27.700> the<00:06:27.760> way<00:06:27.789> of<00:06:27.910> innovation<00:06:28.510> here<00:06:28.750> at

this series in general I guess mercs is
pretty<00:06:52.930> fun<00:06:53.229> especially<00:06:53.800> the<00:06:54.280> Genesis<00:06:54.669> port<00:06:54.970> I

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.300 
pretty fun especially the Genesis port I
honestly<00:06:56.169> don't<00:06:56.320> care<00:06:56.470> for<00:06:56.830> the<00:06:56.889> first<00:06:57.070> game

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
lot of love for the spin-off series that

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.060

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
it on another commando a bionic one but

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.800 
it on another commando a bionic one but
I<00:07:13.060> suppose<00:07:13.599> that's<00:07:13.840> a<00:07:13.990> tale<00:07:14.199> for<00:07:14.440> another<00:07:14.530> time
