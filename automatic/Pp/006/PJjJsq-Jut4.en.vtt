pretty familiar with this gun this again
is<00:00:32.099> exactly<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.210> every<00:00:33.690> other

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309

explosive doll rifle however with a few
key<00:00:38.280> differences<00:00:38.460> firstly<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.690> most

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
key differences firstly and the most

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.580 
key differences firstly and the most
noticeable<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.390> instead<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.719> like

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
noticeable one is that instead of a like

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.410 
noticeable one is that instead of a like
shooting<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> burst<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.579> three<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.360> just

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
shooting a burst of three or just

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
shooting a burst of three or just
shooting<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.559> shoots<00:00:47.129> three<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> time

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
shooting one it shoots three at a time

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.240 
shooting one it shoots three at a time
so<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:49.079> zoomed<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.590> it'll<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> burst

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
so if you're zoomed in it'll be a burst

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.209 
so if you're zoomed in it'll be a burst
of<00:00:50.430> nine<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.090> total<00:00:51.559> secondly<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> much<00:00:53.010> less

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of nine in total secondly and much less

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
of nine in total secondly and much less
obviously<00:00:53.760> each<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.480> these<00:00:54.600> grenades<00:00:54.960> can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
obviously each of these grenades can

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.760 
obviously each of these grenades can
then<00:00:55.800> spawn<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.550> child<00:00:56.910> grenade<00:00:57.500> very<00:00:58.500> very

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
then spawn a child grenade very very

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.750 
then spawn a child grenade very very
similar<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.180> curb<00:01:00.719> blaster<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.760> gold

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
similar to the curb blaster the gold

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.369 
similar to the curb blaster the gold
torque<00:01:03.149> assault<00:01:03.539> rifle<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.049> knows<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
torque assault rifle if he knows you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.840 
torque assault rifle if he knows you
shoot<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> ground<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> car<00:01:05.250> blaster<00:01:05.610> then

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
shoot the ground with a car blaster then

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.510 
shoot the ground with a car blaster then
a<00:01:05.880> grenade<00:01:06.270> comes<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.750> does<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.200> damage

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
a grenade comes out and does more damage

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
a grenade comes out and does more damage
basically<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> same<00:01:08.790> thing<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
basically it's the same thing for this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.450 
basically it's the same thing for this
except<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> grenades<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> spawn

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
except the grenades that spawn

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.899 
except the grenades that spawn

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
afterwards are much much less damaging

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
afterwards are much much less damaging

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
different variations between each gun so

then<00:02:34.980> I'm<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.430> ammo<00:02:35.700> I'm<00:02:35.940> reloading<00:02:36.420> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
then I'm out of ammo I'm reloading that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.950 
then I'm out of ammo I'm reloading that
is<00:02:37.020> just<00:02:37.530> super<00:02:38.220> bad<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> commando<00:02:39.690> so

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
is just super bad like I'm a commando so

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.280 
is just super bad like I'm a commando so
with<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> skill<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:42.000> reload<00:02:42.750> faster<00:02:42.930> is

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
with the skill that you reload faster is

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.700 
with the skill that you reload faster is
maxed<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.060> not<00:02:45.060> only<00:02:45.240> maxed<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:45.870> maxed<00:02:46.560> out

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
maxed out not only maxed out maxed out

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.020 
maxed out not only maxed out maxed out
plus<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:49.400> legendary<00:02:50.400> class<00:02:50.610> mod<00:02:50.850> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
plus I have a legendary class mod that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
plus I have a legendary class mod that
increases<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.480> even<00:02:51.690> more<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.920> still

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
increases it even more and it's I still

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.010 
increases it even more and it's I still
found<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.790> bothers<00:02:54.120> him<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.390> reload<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.780> gun

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
found it bothers him to reload this gun

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.530 
found it bothers him to reload this gun
like<00:02:55.800> two<00:02:56.070> bursts<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.550> then<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> reload<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.270> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
like two bursts and then a reload is is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.510 
like two bursts and then a reload is is
just<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.410> good<00:02:58.620> enough<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.340> was

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
just not good enough and like it was

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.860 
just not good enough and like it was
saying<00:02:59.700> before<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.420> different

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
saying before there is different

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.570 
saying before there is different
variations<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.590> may<00:03:01.740> be<00:03:01.800> able<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.130> find<00:03:02.220> one

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
variations you may be able to find one

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.040 
variations you may be able to find one
where<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.820> can<00:03:03.000> shoot<00:03:03.180> three<00:03:03.630> or<00:03:03.780> even<00:03:03.810> four

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
where you can shoot three or even four

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.699 
where you can shoot three or even four
bursts<00:03:04.740> but<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.670> doubt<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.350> like<00:03:07.350> they're<00:03:07.560> not

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
bursts but I doubt it like they're not

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.100 
bursts but I doubt it like they're not
really<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.220> huge<00:03:08.730> magazine<00:03:09.600> variations

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
really that huge magazine variations

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.520 
really that huge magazine variations
between<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.650> type<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.310> gun<00:03:11.610> also<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
between a type of gun also I have the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.440 
between a type of gun also I have the
normal<00:03:13.740> explosive<00:03:14.459> version<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.270> get

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
normal explosive version and you can get

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
normal explosive version and you can get
this<00:03:15.660> gun<00:03:16.020> although<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.770> can't<00:03:17.070> really<00:03:17.220> get

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
this gun although you can't really get

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.280 
this gun although you can't really get
any<00:03:17.520> other<00:03:17.790> kind<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.180> explosive<00:03:18.269> guns<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.080> can

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
any other kind of explosive guns you can

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.530 
any other kind of explosive guns you can
get<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.739> gun<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.190> different<00:03:20.519> elements<00:03:21.000> so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
get this gun in different elements so

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.500 
get this gun in different elements so
like<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> corrosive<00:03:22.680> version<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.519> or<00:03:23.760> fire

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
like a corrosive version of this or fire

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.940 
like a corrosive version of this or fire
version<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.080> or<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> shock<00:03:25.530> version<00:03:25.860> of

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
version of this or a shock version of

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.440 
version of this or a shock version of
this<00:03:26.070> or<00:03:26.489> even<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.700> slag<00:03:26.970> version<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> this

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
this or even a slag version of this

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.449 
this or even a slag version of this
might<00:03:28.019> actually<00:03:28.170> prove<00:03:28.590> better<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.070> just<00:03:29.310> have

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
might actually prove better I just have

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.490 
might actually prove better I just have
the<00:03:29.580> normal<00:03:29.760> explosive<00:03:30.510> version<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.320> then

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
the normal explosive version but then

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.259 
the normal explosive version but then
again<00:03:31.620> remember<00:03:32.100> explosive<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:32.910> opposed<00:03:33.120> to

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
again remember explosive is opposed to

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.630 
again remember explosive is opposed to
just<00:03:33.330> do<00:03:33.630> more<00:03:34.019> damage<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.650> one<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.370> my<00:03:35.459> main

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
just do more damage and one of my main

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.370 
just do more damage and one of my main
complaints<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.360> if<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.750> you've<00:03:37.019> heard

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
complaints is if you have you've heard

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.830 
complaints is if you have you've heard
is<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.070> doesn't<00:03:38.370> do<00:03:38.489> enough<00:03:38.640> damage<00:03:38.880> so

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
is that it doesn't do enough damage so

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509 
is that it doesn't do enough damage so
changing<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.380> element<00:03:40.800> might<00:03:40.920> even<00:03:41.130> make<00:03:41.340> it

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
changing the element might even make it

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.630 
changing the element might even make it
worse<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.600> department<00:03:43.610> basically<00:03:44.610> all

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
worse in that department basically all

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.150 
worse in that department basically all
in<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.330> isn't<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.780> bad<00:03:45.959> weapon<00:03:46.440> added<00:03:47.070> to

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
in all this isn't a bad weapon added to

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.310 
in all this isn't a bad weapon added to
your<00:03:47.250> collection<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:48.570> could<00:03:48.810> build<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
your collection you could build a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.170 
your collection you could build a
classroom<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.160> know<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.640> commando

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
classroom this I know for the commando

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.330 
classroom this I know for the commando
that<00:03:51.480> there's<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.989> skill<00:03:52.290> specifically<00:03:53.130> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
that there's a skill specifically that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.130 
that there's a skill specifically that
increases<00:03:53.850> assault<00:03:54.420> rifle<00:03:54.690> damage<00:03:54.989> and

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
increases assault rifle damage and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.380 
increases assault rifle damage and
magazine<00:03:55.530> size<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.640> there's<00:03:56.790> class<00:03:57.090> mods

that<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.810> as<00:03:58.320> well<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.250> could

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
that do that as well so you could

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.120 
that do that as well so you could
potentially<00:03:59.970> make<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.570> gun<00:04:00.810> very<00:04:01.170> good<00:04:01.440> but

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
potentially make this gun very good but

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.520 
potentially make this gun very good but
on<00:04:02.459> its<00:04:02.670> own<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.630> doesn't<00:04:03.930> even<00:04:03.989> feel<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.320> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
on its own it doesn't even feel like a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.870 
on its own it doesn't even feel like a
pearlescent<00:04:04.950> weapon<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.580> honest<00:04:05.850> guys

this<00:04:09.209> video<00:04:09.720> somewhere<00:04:10.260> um<00:04:10.860> switching<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.030> a

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
this video somewhere um switching to a

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.990 
this video somewhere um switching to a
hellfire<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.930> kill<00:04:13.140> one<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.530> badass

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
hellfire to kill one of the badass

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.550 
hellfire to kill one of the badass
creepers<00:04:15.000> instead<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:15.959> using<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.350> gun

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
creepers instead of using this gun

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.880 
creepers instead of using this gun
because<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:17.040> gun<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.549> isn't<00:04:18.090> good<00:04:18.209> enough

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
because this gun just isn't good enough

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.289 
because this gun just isn't good enough
basically<00:04:19.890> what<00:04:19.979> I'm<00:04:20.070> saying<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.489> level<00:04:20.760> 61

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
basically what I'm saying is a level 61

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.840 
basically what I'm saying is a level 61
gold<00:04:21.720> hellfire<00:04:22.260> was<00:04:22.919> more<00:04:23.190> suitable<00:04:23.640> in

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
gold hellfire was more suitable in

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.110 
gold hellfire was more suitable in
killing<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.510> guy<00:04:24.690> than<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.169> pearlescent<00:04:26.100> gun

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
