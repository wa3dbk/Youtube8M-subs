 FeldschlÃ¶sschen 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.890
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.899
 press conference after the second league match 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.449
 the sg dynamo dresden against the tsv 1860 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:26.460
 Munich the game ended with 4 to 2 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 I welcome all guests a VIP 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 premises of the fortune gas stadium 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.969
 as well as the two coaches stand out next to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.430
 me 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.260
 Markus von Ahlen from 1860 Munich and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.579
 our head coach or television mr 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 final as always , that is called the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.350
 guest as her conclusion to the game 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.129
 thank you very much first congratulation 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:48.120
 Dynamo Dresden 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.720
 In addition, they deserved victory in advance of the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.689
 game pointed out that dynamo 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.250
 standing here with your back to the wall 

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.210
 will come out the aligned forward 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 will compete 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 That's how it came, we're bitter 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.509
 been punished 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.439
 learn with 3 after 20 minutes 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:06.900
 0 behind 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.360
 we were not in this phase 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.100
 present as you have to be if you are here 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 runs 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 That's what I mean to my team 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.009
 We have to reserve after that again 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.829
 Connecting to the game will do that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.650
 3 1 we think we had the opportunity 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.060
 also to achieve the 3 2 and then 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.770
 it just happens in something like that 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.200
 play no longer allowed to happen shortly before 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.600
 the half time where we are not with the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 absolute consistency defend where that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 4 1 falls then you are actually out 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 the game we had hoped for 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 a little earlier the connection hit too 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.640
 achieve it then again 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.070
 come back to the game that is not 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 successful 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.270
 Overall, I can go after the 15 minutes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.619
 or 20 minutes of my team that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.390
 do not try to deny 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.190
 but we just were not today 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.000
 consistently enough thanks so far 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:05.970
 how come your conclusion from the coach 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.570
 conclusion is certainly extremely positive 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.850
 because the team I believe more 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.330
 has shown that she lives as that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.350
 one or the other could expect 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.530
 I have my team with on the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.750
 given away that I come to the stadium 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.810
 and everyone at the TV meeting this game 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.630
 sees the longing must recognize 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.550
 my players finally win this 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.880
 create after so many weeks and months 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.550
 where we have invested a lot in ourselves 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.800
 extremely positive for my one 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.850
 but just stood there without any profit 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.010
 and it was an untenable situation for 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.410
 us and the way the boys are 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.610
 that went on today was out 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.640
 Outstanding in my view they always have 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.810
 again looking for the way forward 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.880
 surely it is so markus again 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.650
 just said that I am in ours 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.450
 defensive behavior the first half 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.800
 Not at all satisfied because we were 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.700
 the Munich far too much admitted 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.290
 to have 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.100
 they are always between ours 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.060
 lines came that hurt us 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.080
 That's why I'm in one 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.610
 page line not so quiet 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.440
 stayed because I knew exactly what 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.239
 but can happen then has to say something 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.370
 The defense concerns pharma in the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.590
 Everyone has a very stable second half 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.959
 the gap closed which I do not agree 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.880
 hurt though we were 4 1 led the way 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.130
 to do it back and that was what I think 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.920
 the key point why we do that 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.250
 then also very much underlined then 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.340
 safely brought home 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.269
 and i believe that not only team 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.470
 but also surround this victory 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.130
 sincerely wished you were 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.200
 I'm glad that we must have packed that 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.910
 but also say that right now 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.780
 moments that happen in the stadium 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:02.519
 are already history again 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.330
 we are in 60 hours in the street and me 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.790
 faith 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.790
 I do not have to do that anymore for the dynamo fans 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.140
 tell a lot what that does not mean only 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.080
 in derby but the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.190
 table constellation includes a 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.590
 whole lot of explosiveness 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.950
 we have four more 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.850
 possibility to show exactly what we are 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.490
 also showed this evening and to 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.770
 I will do my part to contribute to it 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.040
 my team is doing and then 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:38.870
 we'll see after 34 plays something like that 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.870
 that leads you markus and all good
