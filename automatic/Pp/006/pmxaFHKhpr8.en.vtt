of them and getting some flow out of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.529 
of them and getting some flow out of
them<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.740> we've<00:00:25.949> dich<00:00:26.279> aped<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.910> intake<00:00:27.240> ports

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
them so we've dich aped the intake ports

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.450 
them so we've dich aped the intake ports
on<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.710> exhaust<00:00:28.980> ports<00:00:29.310> are

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
on this one and the exhaust ports are

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.710 
on this one and the exhaust ports are
right<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> hundred<00:00:30.119> percent<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
right at a hundred percent of the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.889 
right at a hundred percent of the
exhaust<00:00:31.230> valve<00:00:31.470> diameter<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.899> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
exhaust valve diameter and it's the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.060 
exhaust valve diameter and it's the
throttle<00:00:34.200> response<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.710> engine<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
throttle response on this engine is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.690 
throttle response on this engine is
pretty<00:00:35.219> amazing

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
pretty amazing

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
pretty amazing

use<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.969> pressure<00:01:48.179> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
use a little bit of back pressure I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.289 
use a little bit of back pressure I
think<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.869> struck<00:01:50.210> it's<00:01:51.210> impressive<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:53.299> it's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
think I struck it's impressive and it's

know him and looking at some velocity
these<00:01:59.759> intake<00:02:00.149> ports<00:02:00.509> how<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.649> speed

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
these intake ports how to really speed

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.830 
these intake ports how to really speed
up<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:02.100> air<00:02:02.310> moving<00:02:02.549> through<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.119> it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
up some air moving through there so it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:20.990 
up some air moving through there so it's
cool<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> have<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.640> another
