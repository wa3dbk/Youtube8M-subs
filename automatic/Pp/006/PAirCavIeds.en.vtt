00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.300
 good after washing 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.950
 placed exhaust 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.820
 let's do the first test of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.820
 escape jetson 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.740
 they are already race 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.170
 how they see an immaculate motorcycle 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.289
 and in this little blow this is unique 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.429
 detail 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:34.210
 the rest is what changed the escape 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.190
 already because the mute I had made 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.480
 a lot of noise so let's do the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 first jetson escape test 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.740
 well this is for the objeta forum 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.030
 scholarships this is my goal later on and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.320
 doing the more a little more of 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.409
 changes 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.900
 and future and any future despacito 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.720
 I'm accommodating myself I like this bike and 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.930
 although I have it nice we are already in a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.220
 future life with sea better I will put 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.600
 another wheel 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 and some things are still missing 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.819
 well this was my vein all this is for 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.909
 the forum of the beta scholarships 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.130
 I do not have it on the floor of notice 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:24.270
 I said and those who always claim me 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.680
 I the fender is of that axis 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.720
 if I did not do any kind of adaptation 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.050
 you can see that you will like the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.050
 motorcycle 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.560
 I did not do any kind of adaptation 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.810
 good boys 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.680
 the only thing I did to the bike so that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.910
 they know it was raise a little bit the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.880
 barral 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.880
 for because the motorcycle is already factory
