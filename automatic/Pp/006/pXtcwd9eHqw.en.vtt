my<00:02:53.790> crust<00:02:54.030> extra<00:02:54.180> crispy<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.169> is<00:02:55.349> one<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
my crust extra crispy so this is one of

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.379 
my crust extra crispy so this is one of
the<00:02:55.889> techniques<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.760> use<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.239> make

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
the techniques that you can use to make

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.940 
the techniques that you can use to make
sure<00:02:57.419> that<00:02:57.689> it<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.109> crispier<00:02:58.560> then<00:02:58.799> if

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
sure that it does get crispier then if

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.990 
sure that it does get crispier then if
you<00:02:59.069> were<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.579> use<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> traditional

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
you were to just use a traditional

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
you were to just use a traditional
baking<00:03:00.569> sheet<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.959> that's<00:03:01.439> why<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:01.650> using<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
baking sheet so that's why I'm using the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.800 
baking sheet so that's why I'm using the
piece<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.189> stone<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.579> don't<00:03:02.760> need<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
piece of stone but you don't need to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.360 
piece of stone but you don't need to
I<00:03:03.840> bought<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.379> pizza<00:03:04.650> stone<00:03:04.829> literally<00:03:05.099> for

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
I bought this pizza stone literally for

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.039 
I bought this pizza stone literally for
ten<00:03:05.579> dollars<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.209> we'll<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.659> how<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.930> actually

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
ten dollars so we'll see how it actually

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.920 
ten dollars so we'll see how it actually
works

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.910
