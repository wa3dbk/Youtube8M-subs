00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.010 

a<00:03:23.970> computer<00:03:24.970> would<00:03:25.090> take<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.360> prop<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.660> this

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
a computer would take a prop like this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.720 
a computer would take a prop like this
and<00:03:26.200> build<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.650> could<00:03:26.800> move<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.100> take<00:03:27.610> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
and build it you could move it take the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.820 
and build it you could move it take the
computer<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.120> minute<00:03:28.600> frame<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.200> drive<00:03:29.440> better

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
computer a minute frame to drive better

artist<00:03:30.340> like<00:03:30.580> Dora<00:03:30.790> she's<00:03:30.970> gonna<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.180> here

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
artist like Dora she's gonna be here

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.210 
artist like Dora she's gonna be here
till<00:03:31.360> next<00:03:31.510> week<00:03:31.780> doing<00:03:32.080> these<00:03:32.200> 60<00:03:32.560> drawings<00:03:32.980> I

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
till next week doing these 60 drawings I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:44.130 
till next week doing these 60 drawings I
mean<00:03:33.550> there's<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.760> lot<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:42.670> breakdown<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.900> an

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
mean there's a lot a breakdown in an

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.270 
mean there's a lot a breakdown in an
energy<00:03:44.680> flow<00:03:45.010> causes<00:03:45.790> viruses<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.900> grow

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
energy flow causes viruses to grow

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.580 
energy flow causes viruses to grow
viruses<00:03:48.280> can<00:03:48.610> make<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.090> ill<00:03:49.390> not<00:03:49.959> these<00:03:50.260> dad

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
viruses can make you ill not these dad

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.090 
viruses can make you ill not these dad
they're<00:03:50.860> digital<00:03:52.020> into<00:03:53.020> your<00:03:53.320> computer<00:03:53.920> and

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
they're digital into your computer and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.210 
they're digital into your computer and
render<00:03:54.670> all<00:03:54.880> your<00:03:55.209> programs

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.240 

that's<00:03:58.370> really<00:03:58.940> bad<00:03:59.800> so<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.950> animator

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
that's really bad so the animator

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.300 
that's really bad so the animator
doesn't<00:04:01.700> set<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:01.970> keyframes<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> scene

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
doesn't set the keyframes in the scene

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.530 
doesn't set the keyframes in the scene
and<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:04.460> the<00:04:04.700> computer<00:04:05.060> does<00:04:05.210> all<00:04:05.330> in

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
and then the computer does all in

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.420 
and then the computer does all in
between<00:04:05.750> that's<00:04:06.380> how<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.680> action<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.220> created

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
between that's how the action is created

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:45.760 
between that's how the action is created
and<00:04:08.150> here<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.420> goes<00:04:08.740> that's<00:04:09.740> action<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:45.500> world

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and here it goes that's action the world

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.500 
and here it goes that's action the world
populated<00:04:46.340> by<00:04:46.580> trying<00:04:47.020> hostile<00:04:48.020> carbon<00:04:48.980> units

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
populated by trying hostile carbon units

00:04:49.510 --> 00:05:01.050 
populated by trying hostile carbon units
what's<00:04:50.510> expedient<00:04:51.440> is<00:04:51.860> vicious<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.720> obedient

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:16.249

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.570 

we<00:05:17.259> can<00:05:17.620> protect<00:05:18.100> our<00:05:18.400> systems<00:05:18.729> from<00:05:19.270> those
