 I mean with this that in our system we overcome adversity 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.250
 and if it were not so, our species would not have been able to survive 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.179
 they say that 400 thousand years 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.550
 they figure if we could not overcome the diseases the wars 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.359
 earthquakes more 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.069
 to adopt 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.069
 we would not be here our kind would have 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.739
 that's why most people 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.710
 We overcome adversity 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.680
 most people 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 we think that life is worth the majority 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.500
 although here in Spain curious 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
 although that is so 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.380
 but people do not go down the street but Felix Osorio 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.940
 1 1% and to a lesser extent the head 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.920
 my sister 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.460

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.760
 here there are very few we are going to a g20 meeting expressed 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050
 and because 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.150
 I believe that he acts 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 that we are influenced by ancient philosophers 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.650
 if they tell you that I fell happy people 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.789
 or happy quarter shop were ignorant 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.570

 finish locality with fano 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.990
 but the reality is that most 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.650
 we have that ability to overcome adversity the most 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.050
 we feel a foot 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.070
 a very interesting topic 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 is the subject of automatic thoughts 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.770
 they are thoughts that we have 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.080
 na 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.300

 they told him 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.030
 i 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.450
 I feel very friendly excited 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450

 kent that 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.019
 I saw that it came with us 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.709
 yet 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.479
 i 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.489
 talk about age mental health 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.410
 he did not tell me he had not heard me and before that even finish the 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.239
 phrase the annual gala what I was saying 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.459
 He says 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 because Spain is fatal 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.609
 Spain 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.819
 and I gave it to him because I do not dust to go alive outside but when I'm going to express Spain 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.909
 it's very good 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.429
 and the Spaniards to the set españa chairs improves imagine you not 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.329
 in classic in the last forty years after 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.429
 not the other you do not know what is going on 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.649
 joan martí i that's an automatic thought 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.609
 think about our automatic thoughts 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.899
 this is a disaster after three rounds 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.579
 and then dispensed 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.579
 then how the trip is so long 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.030
 I was also curious and leprich and 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.890
 I ask the question to live with little because he thinks Spain is so bad 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.889
 and he quickly tells me he looks we are surrounded by abusers and 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.749
 terrorists 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.749
 so he told me 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.709
 i 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.039
 then judge 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.389
 more data then I could not resist and indian 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.159

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.159
 in your neighborhood at home in your family there is a lot 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.929
 abusers 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.929
 percent had been doing it min 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.040
 of course a new problem problem 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.909
 smoke no 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.549
 I have not married myself in my decision not 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.079
 in the settler 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.079
 I tell terrorists how many you know 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.729
 and I did not speak again 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.400
 Navarrese 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.569
 an automatic thought 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.469
 he did not try it again 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:40.409
 there they have been again lion since that I do not have almost seven hours and peak 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.179
 juan de mesa of the minor because I feel Spanish 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.960
 what 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.350
 and that because it says this to you there because you told me 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.189
 and it tells me the TV 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.520
 curious on TV 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.719
 What's the matter with that kind lady? 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.169
 and so speak in china 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.949
 I had confused the news 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.439
 with normal life 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.860
 and then clear what as in what the TV and read the news 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.819
 the more likely something has to occur, the less likely it is to 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.530
 to be news what he is news what 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.029
 the weird truth what does not happen 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.230
 because the resumption 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.229
 and I had confused 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.490
 this does not 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.139
 the news with normal life 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.419
 i'm going to do it transformed into an automatic thought then i 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.060
 I want 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.539
 what at least 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:42.990
 car you see this 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.810
 of this northern conference 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.810
 prince make your automatic thoughts 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.020
 on this occasion and except someone did the others 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.089
 but he explained that saying this 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:58.089
 what do I base myself on 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:02.240
 this is a topic that is very interesting not 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.330
 the mayor 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.260
 speaking from those positive aspects that help us overcome adversity 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.059
 another is optimism 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.319
 and optimism 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.259
 was there that is optimism 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.259
 can you really tell me that they clean they grow 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.180
 19 the optimist envelopes is that of a sterile donor 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.599
 the ingenuity because 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.639
 Yes you are 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.550
 that how can I say that there is a script to live was a meeting here 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.879
 I arrived I am optimistic 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.879
 ms 13 2% 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.960
 ibra is optimistic is confused with the 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.819
 with ingenuity with innovation 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.839
 Optimism is very useful 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.629
 and part of it is the genes of a third of our optimism in 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.509
 genetics 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.509
 a third then the other thing is that your brother works 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.099
 this is optimism 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.099
 to 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.570
 with 15 points this does not let us buy the book etc 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.860
 this is what is currently 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.660
 optimism is how we go to the future as we see the past and how we see the 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:21.809
 I presented 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.069
 how we see the future 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.789
 when we say that a person in the future with optimism that is what has 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.770
 Yesterday 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.110
 hope exactly hope joy but that hope 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.330
 it's hope is 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.039
 think that what we want is going to happen 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:45.429
 that the pain that I feel is going to happen to me 

00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:48.429
 what the job that they have done to me, because I will forget 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:51.399
 those the future 

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.199
 there is a general hope 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.710
 I stayed because I think that every day we will improve human welfare 

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:02.159
 and then you squandered this idea that is based on what we think if I work 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:05.159
 by getting something I'm going to get it 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.429
 there he works to help a family member get 

00:08:10.429 --> 00:08:12.559
 study a career to work
