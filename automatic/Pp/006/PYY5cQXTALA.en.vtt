water<00:00:18.210> pump<00:00:18.390> impeller<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.130> at<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> same<00:00:20.369> time

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:20.579 
water pump impeller and at the same time

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.450 
water pump impeller and at the same time
I<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:20.970> doing<00:00:21.149> an<00:00:21.300> inspection<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.460> to

share with a buddy of mine because a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.560 
share with a buddy of mine because a
slower<00:00:27.630> unit<00:00:28.939> previously<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> never<00:00:30.239> had<00:00:30.390> any

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
slower unit previously I never had any

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
slower unit previously I never had any
problems<00:00:30.989> with<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:32.430> means<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.820> I've

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
problems with it that means that I've

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.160 
problems with it that means that I've
never<00:00:33.030> had<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> water<00:00:33.899> or

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
never had it out on the water or

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
never had it out on the water or
anything<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.649> nature<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:37.080> talking

anything of that nature so just talking
about<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.650> home<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.250> had<00:00:41.340> put<00:00:41.490> a<00:00:41.550> new<00:00:41.730> skate

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
about at home and I had put a new skate

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.740 
about at home and I had put a new skate
on<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:43.820> when<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> bolted<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> back<00:00:45.510> on

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on it and when I bolted it back on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
on it and when I bolted it back on
during<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> whole<00:00:46.380> process<00:00:46.620> called<00:00:47.130> months

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
during this whole process called months

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.750 
during this whole process called months
ago<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.880> started<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.450> whine<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:50.579> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
ago it started to whine and that was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.530 
ago it started to whine and that was
after<00:00:50.970> a<00:00:52.040> maiden<00:00:53.040> voyage<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.240> had<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
after a maiden voyage and I had it

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.290 
after a maiden voyage and I had it
revving<00:00:54.870> high<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.560> I<00:00:56.489> had<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> bang<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> in

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
revving high and I had to bang it in

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
revving high and I had to bang it in
gear<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.200> it<00:00:58.290> back<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> dock<00:00:58.860> because

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
gear to get it back to the dock because

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.550 
gear to get it back to the dock because
the<00:00:59.340> motor<00:00:59.640> wasn't<00:00:59.910> running<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.560> so

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
the motor wasn't running right so

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.460 
the motor wasn't running right so
concerned<00:01:02.040> that<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.250> had<00:01:02.399> broke<00:01:02.730> something<00:01:03.470> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
concerned that I had broke something I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
concerned that I had broke something I
started<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.610> address<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> lower<00:01:06.240> unit<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
started to address the lower unit and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
started to address the lower unit and
then<00:01:06.869> found<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.259> I<00:01:07.290> had<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.680> motor<00:01:07.979> issues

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
then found out I had other motor issues

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
then found out I had other motor issues
that<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.940> have<00:01:09.120> now<00:01:09.330> fixed<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.930> you've<00:01:10.050> seen<00:01:10.260> my

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that I have now fixed if you've seen my

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.700 
that I have now fixed if you've seen my
other<00:01:10.409> videos<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.790> motors<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.360> running

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
other videos the motors up and running

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
other videos the motors up and running
run<00:01:13.710> pretty<00:01:14.010> good<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.400> still<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.760> some<00:01:14.790> tuning

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
run pretty good I still got some tuning

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.770 
run pretty good I still got some tuning
to<00:01:15.300> do<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.860> I'm<00:01:16.860> happy<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> moment<00:01:17.780> but

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to do but I'm happy at the moment but

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
to do but I'm happy at the moment but
before<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.170> move<00:01:19.350> any<00:01:19.530> further<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:20.100> tuning<00:01:20.370> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
before I move any further with tuning of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
before I move any further with tuning of
the<00:01:20.520> motor<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.090> need<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:21.900> sure<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.229> had

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the motor I need to make sure that I had

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
the motor I need to make sure that I had
the<00:01:22.470> lower<00:01:22.620> unit<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.700> thing<00:01:23.940> dunked

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the lower unit on and this thing dunked

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.820 
the lower unit on and this thing dunked
in<00:01:24.390> water<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.960> pumping<00:01:25.290> water<00:01:25.530> correctly

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
in water and pumping water correctly

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.469 
in water and pumping water correctly
because<00:01:26.840> previously<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> had<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> problem<00:01:28.620> where

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
because previously I had a problem where

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.010 
because previously I had a problem where
the<00:01:30.479> water<00:01:30.900> when<00:01:31.409> hooked<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> muffs<00:01:33.020> while

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the water when hooked to the muffs while

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
the water when hooked to the muffs while
it<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.290> pumping<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> would<00:01:35.130> flow<00:01:35.400> through<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it was pumping it would flow through the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.500 
it was pumping it would flow through the
telltale<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:37.400> whenever<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:41.510> crank

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
telltale but whenever you would crank

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.330 
telltale but whenever you would crank
the<00:01:42.690> motor<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.260> continue<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.770> flow<00:01:44.100> but

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the motor it would continue to flow but

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
the motor it would continue to flow but
as<00:01:44.430> soon<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.060> start<00:01:45.540> immediately

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
as soon as it would start immediately

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.060 
as soon as it would start immediately
the<00:01:47.040> water<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.520> stop<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.890> if

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the water would stop and I don't know if

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.250 
the water would stop and I don't know if
that<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.400> lower<00:01:50.700> unit<00:01:50.970> issue<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
that is a lower unit issue or if that is

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.429 
that is a lower unit issue or if that is
an<00:01:52.500> internal<00:01:52.950> issue<00:01:53.960> currently<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.290> run

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
an internal issue currently I can run

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
an internal issue currently I can run
the<00:01:55.560> motor<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.369> hose<00:01:56.640> directed<00:01:57.210> correct

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the motor with a hose directed correct

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.350 
the motor with a hose directed correct
connected<00:01:58.290> directly<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> water<00:02:00.060> inlet

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
connected directly to the water inlet

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.289 
connected directly to the water inlet
pipe<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:01.619> runs<00:02:01.650> up<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> midsection<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
pipe that runs up the midsection and it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.810 
pipe that runs up the midsection and it
flows<00:02:03.450> perfectly<00:02:03.689> fine<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.310> thinking

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
flows perfectly fine so I'm thinking
