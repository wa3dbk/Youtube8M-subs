one shot which is awesome I tried to do

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.289 
one shot which is awesome I tried to do
this<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> few<00:01:56.340> times<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> bow<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.060> arrow

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
this a few times with the bow and arrow

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
this a few times with the bow and arrow
it<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> took<00:01:57.719> forever<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.490> well

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
it just took forever and I was like well

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.889 
it just took forever and I was like well
I<00:01:59.700> don't<00:01:59.820> want<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> show<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.570> literally

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I don't want to show that that literally

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.870 
I don't want to show that that literally
took<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.290> day<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.680> try<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.460> kill<00:02:02.610> his<00:02:02.729> heads

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
took all day to try and kill his heads

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240 
took all day to try and kill his heads
with<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> bow<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.210> arrow<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.619> got<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> idea

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
with the bow and arrow so I got the idea

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
with the bow and arrow so I got the idea
of<00:02:05.369> shooting<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> fireball<00:02:06.210> since<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
of shooting the fireball since I have a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.990 
of shooting the fireball since I have a
lot<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> damage<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.860> my<00:02:08.009> fire<00:02:08.220> spells<00:02:08.489> gotta

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
lot of damage with my fire spells gotta

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.580 
lot of damage with my fire spells gotta
turn<00:02:09.149> around<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.200> soon<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.500> you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
turn around there we go as soon as you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.839 
turn around there we go as soon as you
moves<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.340> turn<00:02:11.520> your<00:02:11.700> head

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
moves you have to like turn your head

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.930 
moves you have to like turn your head
otherwise<00:02:12.090> you're<00:02:12.270> gonna<00:02:12.330> get<00:02:12.510> wrecked

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
otherwise you're gonna get wrecked

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.690 
otherwise you're gonna get wrecked
but<00:02:13.900> yeah<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.320> tried<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.890> fight<00:02:15.160> him<00:02:15.340> without

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
but yeah I I tried to fight him without

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.400 
but yeah I I tried to fight him without
killing<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> little<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.840> snake<00:02:17.140> heads

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
killing the little little snake heads

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.060 
killing the little little snake heads
but<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.070> problem<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.540> those<00:02:19.540> little

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
but the problem is that those little

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.260 
but the problem is that those little
acid<00:02:21.070> spit<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.460> they<00:02:21.610> shoot<00:02:21.820> out<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.090> really

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
acid spit that they shoot out is really

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.940 
acid spit that they shoot out is really
annoying<00:02:22.660> they<00:02:22.960> it's<00:02:23.320> really<00:02:23.530> hard<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.770> dodge

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
annoying they it's really hard to dodge

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.020 
annoying they it's really hard to dodge
and<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.310> have<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.490> keep<00:02:24.640> healing<00:02:24.850> yourself

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
and you have to keep healing yourself

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.110 
and you have to keep healing yourself
with<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.570> Nana<00:02:25.720> venom<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.880> could

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
with your Nana venom and and you could

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.060 
with your Nana venom and and you could
beat<00:02:28.330> him<00:02:28.450> though<00:02:28.720> still<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:29.920> that

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
beat him though still it's just that

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.470 
beat him though still it's just that
later<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.430> when<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:30.790> his<00:02:30.880> health<00:02:31.210> low

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
later on when you get his health low

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.670 
later on when you get his health low
enough<00:02:31.690> he<00:02:31.900> starts<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.290> shoot<00:02:32.470> out<00:02:32.560> these

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
enough he starts to shoot out these

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.170 
enough he starts to shoot out these
little<00:02:32.800> spirits<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.460> can<00:02:33.610> only<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.880> killed

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
little spirits that can only be killed

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.300 
little spirits that can only be killed
with<00:02:34.390> fire<00:02:35.170> spells<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.830> was<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.130> well

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
with fire spells so I was like well

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.610 
with fire spells so I was like well
that's<00:02:37.090> too<00:02:37.270> much<00:02:37.390> crap<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.660> dodge<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.260> just

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
that's too much crap to dodge so I just

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.990 
that's too much crap to dodge so I just
decided<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:39.130> go<00:02:39.250> ahead<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.490> remove<00:02:39.640> all<00:02:39.880> of

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
decided to go ahead and remove all of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.640 
decided to go ahead and remove all of
his<00:02:40.120> heads<00:02:40.300> before<00:02:40.510> doing<00:02:40.780> actually<00:02:41.350> need<00:02:41.500> a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
his heads before doing actually need a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.770 
his heads before doing actually need a
minus<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.370> now<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> lot<00:02:43.150> easier<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.660> I'll

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
minus and now it's a lot easier so I'll

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.000 
minus and now it's a lot easier so I'll
have<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.960> do<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.230> sit<00:02:44.350> here<00:02:44.380> shoot<00:02:44.740> at<00:02:44.920> his

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
have to do is sit here shoot at his

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.370 
have to do is sit here shoot at his
eyeball<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.750> throw<00:02:46.810> fireballs<00:02:47.050> at

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
eyeball and you can throw fireballs at

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.400 
eyeball and you can throw fireballs at
him<00:02:47.500> let's<00:02:48.460> see<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:49.030> want<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.690> do<00:02:49.840> something

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
him let's see I want to do something

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.930 
him let's see I want to do something
with<00:02:51.040> my<00:02:51.190> bone<00:02:51.370> here<00:02:51.520> i<00:02:51.550> think<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.820> bow<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
with my bone here i think the bow and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820 
with my bone here i think the bow and
arrow<00:02:52.150> actually<00:02:52.450> works<00:02:52.630> good<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.680> for

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
arrow actually works good for that for

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.050 
arrow actually works good for that for
the<00:02:53.890> eyeball<00:02:54.130> part<00:02:54.370> because<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.670> doesn't<00:02:54.910> seem

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
the eyeball part because it doesn't seem

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.160 
the eyeball part because it doesn't seem
like<00:02:55.090> i'm<00:02:55.300> moving<00:02:55.540> too<00:02:55.600> much<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.020> we've

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
like i'm moving too much of it so we've

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.260 
like i'm moving too much of it so we've
gotta<00:02:56.440> move<00:02:56.590> back<00:02:56.770> up<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:57.520> little<00:02:57.670> laser<00:02:58.060> as

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
gotta move back up that little laser as

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.520 
gotta move back up that little laser as
long<00:02:58.450> as<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.900> second<00:02:59.320> platform

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
long as you're on this second platform

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.560 
long as you're on this second platform
you<00:02:59.830> won't<00:02:59.980> get<00:03:00.070> hit<00:03:00.190> by<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.280> laser<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:00.910> it's

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
you won't get hit by that laser so it's

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.510 
you won't get hit by that laser so it's
always<00:03:01.810> best<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.560> my<00:03:02.740> opinion<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:03.160> stay<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.430> on

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
always best in my opinion to stay up on

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.920 
always best in my opinion to stay up on
this<00:03:03.640> platform<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.090> i<00:03:04.150> use<00:03:04.330> my<00:03:04.510> strong

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
this platform so i use my strong
