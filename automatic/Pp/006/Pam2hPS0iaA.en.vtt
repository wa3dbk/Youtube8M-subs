00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.990 

this<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> start<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.520> ladder<00:00:08.730> we've

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
this is how to start the ladder we've

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.110 
this is how to start the ladder we've
also<00:00:09.750> known<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.200> quadrant<00:00:10.770> we've<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.940> take<00:00:12.090> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
also known as quadrant we've we take a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.580 
also known as quadrant we've we take a
piece<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> beading<00:00:12.780> thread<00:00:13.020> and<00:00:13.200> any

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
piece of beading thread and any

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.259 
piece of beading thread and any
particular<00:00:13.920> shape<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.460> size<00:00:14.640> bead<00:00:14.970> that<00:00:15.210> you

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
particular shape or size bead that you

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.839 
particular shape or size bead that you
need<00:00:15.540> rounds<00:00:16.020> work<00:00:16.260> always<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> best<00:00:16.950> so<00:00:17.730> what

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
need rounds work always the best so what

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.429 
need rounds work always the best so what
we<00:00:17.939> do<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.300> take<00:00:18.450> our<00:00:18.630> beading<00:00:19.020> thread<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we do is we take our beading thread and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:28.540 
we do is we take our beading thread and
we<00:00:19.560> thread<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.010> four<00:00:20.730> beads<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:25.790> two<00:00:26.790> three

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
we thread on four beads so one two three

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.440 
we thread on four beads so one two three
four<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> moment<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:33.090> four

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
four so the moment we just have four

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840 
four so the moment we just have four
beads<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> piece<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.620> beading<00:00:34.920> thread<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
beads on a piece of beading thread so to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
beads on a piece of beading thread so to
begin<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.420> ladder<00:00:36.809> weave<00:00:37.020> or<00:00:37.290> quadrant<00:00:37.739> weave

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
begin a ladder weave or quadrant weave

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.980 
begin a ladder weave or quadrant weave
we<00:00:38.520> take<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.970> end<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.330> beading<00:00:39.630> thread<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
we take one end of the beading thread it

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.990 
we take one end of the beading thread it
doesn't<00:00:40.170> matter<00:00:40.290> left<00:00:40.560> or<00:00:40.740> right<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.730> pass

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
doesn't matter left or right and we pass

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.260 
doesn't matter left or right and we pass
it<00:00:42.330> back<00:00:42.750> through<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.470> opposite<00:00:44.040> direction

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
it back through the opposite direction

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.320 
it back through the opposite direction
to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> first<00:00:45.630> or<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.230> last<00:00:46.260> bead<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.120> pop

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
to the first or the last bead so we pop

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.920 
to the first or the last bead so we pop
it<00:00:48.450> through<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.220> we<00:00:50.220> pull<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.510> tight

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it through and we pull nice and tight

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.980 
it through and we pull nice and tight
make<00:00:52.290> sure<00:00:52.410> we've<00:00:52.530> got<00:00:52.560> equal<00:00:53.190> beading<00:00:53.610> thread

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
make sure we've got equal beading thread

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.390 
make sure we've got equal beading thread
either<00:00:54.990> side<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.830> when<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.040> pull<00:00:56.220> nice<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
either side so when you pull nice and

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.150 
either side so when you pull nice and
tight<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.630> then<00:00:57.810> have<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.380> quadrant<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
tight you then have a quadrant or a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
tight you then have a quadrant or a
diamond<00:00:59.700> or<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> kite<00:01:00.270> however<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:00.810> want<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
diamond or a kite however you want to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.380 
diamond or a kite however you want to
call<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.380> and<00:01:01.740> that's<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> beginning<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:03.000> your

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
call it and that's the beginning of your

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 
call it and that's the beginning of your
basic<00:01:03.960> ladder<00:01:04.559> weave<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> continue<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
basic ladder weave so to continue the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.840 
basic ladder weave so to continue the
weave<00:01:06.350> we<00:01:07.350> take<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.950> left<00:01:08.100> hand<00:01:08.220> part<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
weave we take the left hand part of the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
weave we take the left hand part of the
beading<00:01:09.119> thread<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.229> thread<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.649> two

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
beading thread and we thread on two

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.789 
beading thread and we thread on two
beads<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.240> two<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.469> time<00:01:19.679> we

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
beads so one and two and this time we

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
beads so one and two and this time we
pop<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.609> other<00:01:20.700> side<00:01:20.789> because<00:01:21.539> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pop on one on the other side because the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.319 
pop on one on the other side because the
last<00:01:21.990> bead<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.770> first<00:01:23.219> four<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
last bead of the first four was the

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.499 
last bead of the first four was the
first<00:01:24.749> bead<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> next<00:01:26.069> four<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.270> take

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
first bead of the next four so we take

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
first bead of the next four so we take
the<00:01:27.689> fourth<00:01:27.960> bead<00:01:28.880> with<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:29.999> fact<00:01:30.270> we've<00:01:30.479> only

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the fourth bead with in fact we've only

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
the fourth bead with in fact we've only
put<00:01:30.810> three<00:01:31.079> beads<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.499> this<00:01:31.710> time<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.210> pop

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
put three beads on this time so we pop

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.749 
put three beads on this time so we pop
on<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.619> next<00:01:34.829> B<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.249> can<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.490> we've<00:01:35.609> got<00:01:35.639> a

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
on the next B so you can see we've got a

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
on the next B so you can see we've got a
row<00:01:35.969> of<00:01:35.999> four<00:01:36.359> so<00:01:36.840> again<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.229> repeat<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
row of four so again we repeat the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.709 
row of four so again we repeat the
process<00:01:37.649> so<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.639> take<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.119> side<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.509> has<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
process so we take the side that has the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.129 
process so we take the side that has the
solitary<00:01:40.560> bead<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.819> pass<00:01:41.999> it<00:01:42.240> through<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
solitary bead and we pass it through the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
solitary bead and we pass it through the
second<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.889> other<00:01:44.219> side<00:01:45.469> so<00:01:46.469> we<00:01:46.499> pull<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
second on the other side so we pull that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.639 
second on the other side so we pull that
through<00:01:47.459> and<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.999> pull<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
through and we pull as you can see you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.129 
through and we pull as you can see you
get<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:49.920> second<00:01:50.399> diamond<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.810> repeat

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
get your second diamond so we repeat

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.809 
get your second diamond so we repeat
this<00:01:52.259> process<00:01:52.469> until<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
this process until you get to the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.609 
this process until you get to the
desired<00:01:54.090> length<00:01:54.359> of<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.659> bracelet<00:01:55.049> will

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
desired length of your bracelet will

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.429 
desired length of your bracelet will
choke<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.520> necklace<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.049> we'll<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.289> one

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
choke or your necklace so we'll do one

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.669 
choke or your necklace so we'll do one
more<00:01:58.469> side<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> we'll<00:02:00.209> put<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.600> bead<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.319> the

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
more side so we'll put one bead on the

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.059 
more side so we'll put one bead on the
left-hand<00:02:02.069> side<00:02:02.869> one<00:02:03.869> bead<00:02:04.139> on<00:02:05.599> after<00:02:06.599> that<00:02:07.069> so

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
left-hand side one bead on after that so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.230 
left-hand side one bead on after that so
again<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.520> three<00:02:08.759> beads

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
again we have three beads

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.420 
again we have three beads
that's<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.289> third<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.979> we're<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.130> going<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that's the third so we're just going to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.490 
that's the third so we're just going to
add<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.120> make<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.540> fourth<00:02:12.780> bead

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.740 

like<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.670> we've<00:02:18.760> got<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.030> bead<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.570> one

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
like so so we've got one bead on one

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.510 
like so so we've got one bead on one
side<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.320> we've<00:02:20.500> got<00:02:20.650> two<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.100> other<00:02:21.160> with

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
side and we've got two on the other with

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.730 
side and we've got two on the other with
the<00:02:21.610> fourth<00:02:21.880> bead<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.450> middle<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.530> take

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
the fourth bead in the middle so we take

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.470 
the fourth bead in the middle so we take
always<00:02:24.100> tapes<00:02:24.310> either<00:02:24.610> beading<00:02:25.030> thread<00:02:25.240> that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
always tapes either beading thread that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.050 
always tapes either beading thread that
only<00:02:25.660> has<00:02:25.840> one<00:02:26.020> be<00:02:26.200> detached<00:02:26.650> pass<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.760> through

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
only has one be detached pass it through

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.190 
only has one be detached pass it through
the<00:02:28.600> last<00:02:28.780> bead<00:02:28.960> on<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> other<00:02:30.190> side<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:31.200> pull

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the last bead on the other side and pull

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.650 
the last bead on the other side and pull
and<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.280> your<00:02:33.640> ladder<00:02:33.940> weave<00:02:34.180> or

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and that is your ladder weave or

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.590 
and that is your ladder weave or
quadrant<00:02:35.410> weave
