that<00:00:40.629> was<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.110> wrong<00:00:41.320> kind<00:00:41.590> of<00:00:41.739> completely

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
that was the wrong kind of completely

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.500 
that was the wrong kind of completely
wrong<00:00:42.699> not<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.180> color<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.480> want<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:45.510> because

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510

wrong not the color I want and because
it<00:00:46.750> looked<00:00:46.960> so<00:00:47.110> different<00:00:47.410> on<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.860> palette

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
it looked so different on the palette

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.340 
it looked so different on the palette
and<00:00:48.280> apparently<00:00:48.730> was<00:00:48.910> like<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.269> deep<00:00:49.720> and<00:00:51.180> we

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

45<00:02:27.790> minutes<00:02:27.820> because<00:02:28.300> red<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.650> more

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
45 minutes because red it's more

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.600 
45 minutes because red it's more
difficult<00:02:30.160> for<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.610> hair<00:02:30.820> hair<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.480> UM<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
difficult for the hair hair to UM to

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.200 
difficult for the hair hair to UM to
take<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.210> red<00:02:34.510> color<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.280> usually<00:02:36.670> stays

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
take that red color so it usually stays

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.380 
take that red color so it usually stays
on<00:02:37.450> longer<00:02:37.630> than<00:02:37.840> any<00:02:38.230> other<00:02:38.440> color<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.550> then<00:02:40.300> I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
on longer than any other color so then I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
on longer than any other color so then I
put<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.810> my<00:02:40.960> head<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.410> left<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
put it on my head and left it in the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.840 
put it on my head and left it in the
Amba<00:02:43.030> also<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:43.900> an<00:02:44.050> hour<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.640> wash<00:02:45.820> it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
Amba also for an hour and then I wash it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.030 
Amba also for an hour and then I wash it
out<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.300> because<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:47.140> doing<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.860> whole

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
out and because I was doing the whole

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.480 
out and because I was doing the whole
closet<00:02:48.490> process<00:02:49.240> by<00:02:49.510> night<00:02:49.750> time<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.560> looked

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
closet process by night time it looked

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.870 
closet process by night time it looked
differently<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.920> lighting<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.670> I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
differently because of the lighting so I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.850 
differently because of the lighting so I
don't<00:02:55.209> recommend<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.959> dye<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.320> hair

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
don't recommend you dye your hair

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.190 
don't recommend you dye your hair
at<00:02:57.040> nighttime<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.700> never<00:02:57.970> because<00:02:58.570> at<00:02:58.959> that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
at nighttime you never because at that

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.430 
at nighttime you never because at that
time<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:01.060> lighting<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.540> different<00:03:01.989> it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
time the lighting is so different it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770 
time the lighting is so different it
will<00:03:02.650> look<00:03:02.890> different<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.330> right<00:03:04.510> now

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
will look different but like right now

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.770

same<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> sunlight<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:09.820> I<00:03:10.060> recommend

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
same in the sunlight so I recommend

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120

color these colors look so different

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.280 
color these colors look so different
first<00:05:31.910> one<00:05:32.180> they<00:05:32.330> would<00:05:32.480> run<00:05:32.750> when<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:32.960> picked

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
first one they would run when I picked

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.290 
first one they would run when I picked
up<00:05:33.410> looks<00:05:33.920> so<00:05:34.250> different<00:05:34.580> on<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.850> panettone

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300

Pat<00:05:35.540> was<00:05:35.840> like<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.080> deep<00:05:36.560> cherry<00:05:37.160> red<00:05:37.880> as<00:05:38.330> I

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
Pat was like a deep cherry red as I

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.980 
Pat was like a deep cherry red as I
wanted<00:05:38.870> but<00:05:39.050> then<00:05:39.560> it<00:05:40.040> was<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:41.060> different<00:05:41.660> when

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
wanted but then it was so different when

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.440 
wanted but then it was so different when
I<00:05:42.050> put<00:05:42.290> it<00:05:42.380> on<00:05:42.440> my<00:05:42.620> head<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.280> be<00:05:43.520> careful<00:05:44.120> don't

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
I put it on my head so be careful don't

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.510 
I put it on my head so be careful don't
think<00:05:44.810> that<00:05:45.020> the<00:05:45.590> color<00:05:45.830> will<00:05:46.070> turn<00:05:46.190> out

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
think that the color will turn out

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.670 
think that the color will turn out
exactly<00:05:46.670> the<00:05:47.150> same<00:05:47.510> way<00:05:47.750> as<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.230> is<00:05:48.380> on<00:05:48.530> the

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
exactly the same way as it is on the

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.060 
exactly the same way as it is on the
palate<00:05:49.310> so<00:05:50.120> it<00:05:50.690> actually<00:05:50.870> depends<00:05:51.410> on<00:05:51.620> how

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
palate so it actually depends on how

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.480 
palate so it actually depends on how
your<00:05:52.370> hair<00:05:52.580> is<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.320> how<00:05:54.320> much<00:05:54.500> you<00:05:54.560> bleached

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
your hair is and how much you bleached

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.860 
your hair is and how much you bleached
it<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:57.310> then<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.340> bought<00:05:58.640> this<00:05:58.970> one<00:05:59.270> so<00:05:59.450> just<00:05:59.480> to

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
it so then I bought this one so just to

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.650 
it so then I bought this one so just to
mix<00:06:00.080> it<00:06:00.260> with<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.710> fuchsia<00:06:01.610> right<00:06:01.880> so<00:06:02.480> it

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
mix it with the fuchsia right so it

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.930 
mix it with the fuchsia right so it
wouldn't<00:06:02.900> turn<00:06:03.050> off<00:06:03.200> cheering<00:06:03.740> right<00:06:05.290> so<00:06:06.940> I

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
wouldn't turn off cheering right so I

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.270 
wouldn't turn off cheering right so I
did<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.900> same<00:06:09.140> thing<00:06:09.470> as<00:06:09.650> I<00:06:09.680> did<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:10.100> first

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
did the same thing as I did the first

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.900 
did the same thing as I did the first
time<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.670> mixed<00:06:11.150> those<00:06:11.330> and<00:06:11.890> just<00:06:12.890> put<00:06:13.670> a<00:06:13.700> little

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
time I mixed those and just put a little

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.680 
time I mixed those and just put a little
bit<00:06:14.120> of<00:06:14.920> the<00:06:15.920> mahogany<00:06:16.670> in<00:06:17.030> it<00:06:17.270> and<00:06:17.450> it<00:06:17.660> makes

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
bit of the mahogany in it and it makes

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.390 
bit of the mahogany in it and it makes
it's<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.200> way<00:06:18.320> to<00:06:18.380> turn<00:06:18.680> off<00:06:18.890> a<00:06:19.040> little<00:06:19.220> bit

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
it's a way to turn off a little bit

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.010 
it's a way to turn off a little bit
darker<00:06:20.170> and<00:06:21.170> to<00:06:21.820> to<00:06:22.820> make<00:06:23.060> to<00:06:23.390> test<00:06:23.660> it

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
darker and to to make to test it

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.190 
darker and to to make to test it
I<00:06:24.050> just<00:06:24.410> died<00:06:25.280> once<00:06:25.730> drank<00:06:26.180> one<00:06:26.510> of<00:06:26.690> this<00:06:26.780> drink

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
I just died once drank one of this drink

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.840 
I just died once drank one of this drink
at<00:06:27.410> first<00:06:27.680> to<00:06:27.950> see<00:06:28.160> how<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:28.340> color<00:06:28.640> would

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
at first to see how the color would

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.330 
at first to see how the color would
actually<00:06:29.240> turn<00:06:29.420> out<00:06:29.630> so<00:06:30.500> I<00:06:30.560> liked<00:06:30.860> it<00:06:31.070> and<00:06:31.190> then

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
actually turn out so I liked it and then

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.200 
actually turn out so I liked it and then
I<00:06:31.580> put<00:06:32.000> it<00:06:32.570> on<00:06:32.660> my<00:06:32.780> whole<00:06:33.020> head<00:06:33.260> left<00:06:33.860> it<00:06:34.210> again

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
I put it on my whole head left it again

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.130 
I put it on my whole head left it again
for<00:06:35.420> a<00:06:35.450> mark<00:06:35.720> M<00:06:36.130> for<00:06:37.130> about<00:06:37.340> an<00:06:37.460> hour<00:06:37.930> and<00:06:38.930> after

it how I wanted it to be so that's what
I<00:06:50.540> did

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.200 

i<00:06:53.530> condition<00:06:54.530> it<00:06:54.800> very<00:06:55.160> very<00:06:55.490> all<00:06:55.760> i<00:06:55.970> did<00:06:56.180> a

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
i condition it very very all i did a

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.640 
i condition it very very all i did a
deep<00:06:56.510> conditioning<00:06:57.190> after<00:06:58.190> that<00:06:58.400> whole

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
deep conditioning after that whole

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.720
