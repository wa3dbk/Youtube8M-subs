next we'll check the adjustment of the
unit<00:01:58.860> operate<00:01:59.860> each<00:02:00.009> half<00:02:00.430> make<00:02:00.939> sure<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.240> it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
unit operate each half make sure that it

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.749 
unit operate each half make sure that it
slides<00:02:01.659> freely<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.920> closes<00:02:03.100> against<00:02:03.610> the

slides freely that it closes against the

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.690 
slides freely that it closes against the
other<00:02:03.909> half<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:05.890> case<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.250> can<00:02:06.369> see<00:02:06.549> that

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
other half in this case you can see that

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.249 
other half in this case you can see that
it's<00:02:06.850> not<00:02:07.000> closing<00:02:07.270> at<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.659> top<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.170> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
it's not closing at the top and the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.199 
it's not closing at the top and the
left-hand<00:02:08.950> unit<00:02:09.280> it's<00:02:09.670> not<00:02:09.849> against<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
left-hand unit it's not against the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.140 
left-hand unit it's not against the
right<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:12.760> tighten<00:02:13.120> left<00:02:13.690> hand<00:02:13.959> unit<00:02:15.150> that's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
right will tighten left hand unit that's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.360 
right will tighten left hand unit that's
finding<00:02:16.540> its<00:02:16.690> block<00:02:16.989> for<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.349> right<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.980> think

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
finding its block for the right I think

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.570 
finding its block for the right I think
you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.519> see<00:02:21.670> now<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.180> closes<00:02:22.330> tightly

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you can see now that it closes tightly

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.000 
you can see now that it closes tightly
next<00:02:24.580> we'll<00:02:24.730> remove<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.209> labels<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.860> we'll

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
next we'll remove the labels now we'll

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.949 
next we'll remove the labels now we'll
install<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.489> handle<00:02:30.700> will<00:02:31.150> verify<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
install the handle will verify that the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.949 
install the handle will verify that the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.199 
screw is not sticking out the back side
and<00:02:34.959> then<00:02:35.290> we'll<00:02:35.440> tilt<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.950> into<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.700> groove

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and then we'll tilt it into the groove

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.259 
and then we'll tilt it into the groove
on<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.480> housing<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.640> tighten<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:40.060> head
