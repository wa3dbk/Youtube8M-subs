00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello everyone in this video, I will tell you how 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.040
 make a little toy 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.309
 minion 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.380
 one-eyed will do out of the box 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.660
 kinder surprise 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.779
 to tie minion we take 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.270
 box by kinder and here is such a 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.890
 which fandok breaks off the cap but 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 In principle, this is not important because 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 what are we going to make it not opening 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 and we tie this box with threads we take 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.270
 I have this thread heresy and knit begin 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.280
 from the head we take the yellow color 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 air loops chain of 4 air 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.730
 loops connect it in a circle and knit in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.289
 first round of 8 single crochets and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.940
 further knit in a circle so that we 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.730
 the head was formed plump 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.640
 putting the boxes so that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.010
 turned head tied at me 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.460
 the top of the minion can and and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.250
 try on here she goes somewhere that's not up to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.820
 the middle and more that is this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 somewhere probably about three quarters 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.049
 ranked and the bottom of the jeans fit 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.630
 just as well here I am immediately an example of them 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.570
 in this way 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.119
 up and tanis and then you need to sew 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.299
 top and bottom and tie 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.509
 jeans bib pants bib 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.380
 knit on 10 loops straight and reverse 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.180
 in rows of 3 rows and then knit strings so 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.360
 how can you please them 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.149
 knit like this in a circle and then 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.430
 put on the finished product already or you can 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.350
 tie and cross with a crossroads like 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.970
 it is more convenient for you to do this and that 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950
 the most important thing to make it look like 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 jeans 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.840
 Iâ€™m ready to have a calf 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.610
 Here I decided to make a breastplate 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.790
 so that is, we take a chain of air 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.509
 loops knit it the right length given 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.580
 that here are the pens 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.910
 pin it on here here 1 loop 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.160
 knit further here 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.550
 also air loops and attach 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.680
 thread and sewn top and bottom y 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.660
 us yellow and blue 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.870
 I weigh a thread to sew 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.230
 handle and immediately show how to knit 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.930
 handles and legs they tally equally 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.020
 only different colors start typing 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.440
 four air loops connect them in 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.210
 circle and knit in this circle eight 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.200
 columns and then in the first row 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.930
 add from each column 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 knit two loops 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.400
 it turns out 16 loops and then on these 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.250
 16 loops we knit straight a pair of rows 2 3 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.740
 whichever thread you have 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 then knit on the same loops 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.270
 we attach a yellow thread and knit 4 rows 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.160
 It turns out here such a pen again 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.050
 I repeat that everything depends on 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.330
 how thick your thread and hook 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.610
 because size will naturally be 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.990
 vary he is such a pen here 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.660
 It turned out leg fit in exactly the same way 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.480
 lower black part but instead of yellow 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.490
 we go blue get jeans all 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.940
 pens, legs, we stuffed with a cotton swab and 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:33.160
 sew to the body so I sewed already 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.680
 handle-legs almost everything is ready and 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.970
 made glasses how did i do it 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.459
 gray thread, I scored 12 loops closed 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.730
 in a circle and tied one row in a circle 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.130
 single crochet and everything left 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.980
 black thread right here here attach 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.920
 thread on the side also tie like this 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.760
 circle holder for glasses 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.880
 and link 1 row back there all 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:07.280
 badges already ready left decided them already 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:11.239

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.680
 wonderful and it only remains to do 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.700
 hairs from the threads and that's minonchik already 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.450
