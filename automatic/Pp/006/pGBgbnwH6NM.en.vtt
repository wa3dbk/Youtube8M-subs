00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in the early 1980s we were using some

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
in the early 1980s we were using some
some<00:01:21.810> chemicals<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.220> were<00:01:23.369> available<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
some chemicals that were available and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020 
some chemicals that were available and
used<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.780> keep<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> birds<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:26.030> these

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
used to keep the birds off off these

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.990 
used to keep the birds off off these
these<00:01:27.960> grapes<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:29.340> apply<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
these grapes we would apply it to the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.380 
these grapes we would apply it to the
grapes<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:31.369> fairly<00:01:32.369> close<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> harvest

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
grapes just fairly close to the harvest

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.929 
grapes just fairly close to the harvest
and<00:01:33.650> what<00:01:34.650> would<00:01:34.799> happen<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.670> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and what would happen with that is is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.600 
and what would happen with that is is
that<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.420> birds<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:37.020> eat<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> they

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that the birds would eat it and they

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.420 
that the birds would eat it and they
would<00:01:38.790> eventually<00:01:39.329> vomit<00:01:40.130> because<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
would eventually vomit because it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
would eventually vomit because it
affected<00:01:41.880> their<00:01:42.060> nervous<00:01:42.450> systems<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.409> were

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
affected their nervous systems we were

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
affected their nervous systems we were
all<00:01:43.619> told<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.130> these<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.610> these<00:01:44.759> chemicals

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
all told that these that these chemicals

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.469 
all told that these that these chemicals
disappear<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.729> pick<00:01:48.000> there

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
disappear you know you don't pick there

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
disappear you know you don't pick there
was<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> certain<00:01:48.840> time<00:01:49.320> about<00:01:49.740> 10<00:01:50.009> days<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
was a certain time about 10 days that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.039 
was a certain time about 10 days that
you<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.270> don't<00:01:51.540> pick<00:01:51.899> before<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.829> then

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
you don't you don't pick before and then

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.139 
you don't you don't pick before and then
Canada<00:01:55.049> decided<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.759> were<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
Canada decided that they were going to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.940 
Canada decided that they were going to
measure<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.869> amount<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.500> left<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
measure the amount that was left in the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560 
measure the amount that was left in the
wine<00:01:59.280> which<00:01:59.610> none<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> us<00:02:00.090> even<00:02:00.210> thought<00:02:00.540> about

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
wine which none of us even thought about

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.800 
wine which none of us even thought about
because<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.200> were<00:02:01.290> told<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.860> gone<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
because we were told it was all gone and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
because we were told it was all gone and
then<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.960> ended<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.409> making<00:02:04.920> some<00:02:05.280> standards

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
then they ended up making some standards

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.359 
then they ended up making some standards
and<00:02:06.350> eventually<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.500> banned<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> substance

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and eventually they banned the substance

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.889 
and eventually they banned the substance
because<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> became<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.179> was<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> neurotoxin

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
because it became it was a neurotoxin

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.580 
because it became it was a neurotoxin
and<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:12.340> was<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.489> neurotoxin<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:14.230> not<00:02:14.409> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and it was a neurotoxin just not the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.130 
and it was a neurotoxin just not the
birds<00:02:14.890> turns<00:02:15.670> out<00:02:15.939> it<00:02:16.480> turned<00:02:16.720> out<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.989> was<00:02:17.110> a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
birds turns out it turned out it was a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.009 
birds turns out it turned out it was a
neurotoxin<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.310> human<00:02:18.549> beings<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:19.019> that

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
neurotoxin for human beings to that

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.160 
neurotoxin for human beings to that
knowledge<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.489> my<00:02:21.790> mind<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.540> came<00:02:23.049> from

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
knowledge in my mind that came from

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.679 
knowledge in my mind that came from
agriculture<00:02:23.879> learning<00:02:24.879> about<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> birds<00:02:25.329> and

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
agriculture learning about the birds and

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.710 
agriculture learning about the birds and
what<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.200> does<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.069> then<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.549> course

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
what it does and and then of course

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.479 
what it does and and then of course
realizing<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.870> they<00:02:29.530> would<00:02:29.680> even<00:02:29.890> banned<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
realizing that they would even banned it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.920 
realizing that they would even banned it
in<00:02:30.609> canada<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.060> united<00:02:31.390> states<00:02:31.450> hadn't

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
in canada in the united states hadn't

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.740 
in canada in the united states hadn't
even<00:02:31.989> thought<00:02:32.079> about<00:02:32.260> banning<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:33.540> got<00:02:34.540> me<00:02:34.720> to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
even thought about banning it got me to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.149 
even thought about banning it got me to
thinking<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.349> course<00:02:35.590> about<00:02:35.829> well<00:02:36.010> how<00:02:36.099> does

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
thinking of course about well how does

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.929 
thinking of course about well how does
that<00:02:36.400> affect<00:02:36.790> our<00:02:37.060> health<00:02:37.480> all<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.170> time<00:02:38.379> and

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
that affect our health all the time and

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.849 
that affect our health all the time and
what<00:02:39.939> are<00:02:40.060> these<00:02:40.150> tiny<00:02:40.810> little<00:02:40.930> substances

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
what are these tiny little substances

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.539 
what are these tiny little substances
that<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.280> mean<00:02:42.879> amounts<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.780> don't<00:02:44.680> pay

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
that I mean amounts that we don't pay

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.750 
that I mean amounts that we don't pay
much<00:02:45.730> attention<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.650> these<00:02:47.650> small<00:02:48.069> amounts<00:02:48.700> of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
much attention to these small amounts of

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.059 
much attention to these small amounts of
chemicals<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> big<00:02:50.829> companies

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
chemicals that that the big companies

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.160 
chemicals that that the big companies
say<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.849> know<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.269> trace<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.930> trace

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
say you know just trace the trace

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.990 
say you know just trace the trace
amounts<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.769> kind<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.159> effect<00:02:54.670> can<00:02:54.879> they

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
amounts what kind of effect can they

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.869 
amounts what kind of effect can they
have<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.099> think<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.400> was<00:02:57.489> from<00:02:57.579> theirs

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
have and and I think it was from theirs

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.619 
have and and I think it was from theirs
then<00:02:58.299> I<00:02:58.329> started<00:02:58.900> studying<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.409> as<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> doctor

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
then I started studying that as a doctor

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.789 
then I started studying that as a doctor
realizing<00:03:01.629> it<00:03:01.780> doesn't<00:03:02.079> take<00:03:02.200> very<00:03:02.379> much<00:03:02.500> of

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
realizing it doesn't take very much of

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.160 
realizing it doesn't take very much of
anything<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.430> make<00:03:03.879> major<00:03:04.180> changes<00:03:04.389> to<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
anything to make major changes to the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.229 
anything to make major changes to the

body system immune system I began kind

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.770 
body system immune system I began kind
of<00:03:10.329> studying<00:03:10.689> that<00:03:10.930> side<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.530> medicine<00:03:12.400> and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
of studying that side of medicine and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.710 
of studying that side of medicine and
trying<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.989> minimize<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.220> amount<00:03:15.430> of

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
trying to minimize the amount of

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.689 
trying to minimize the amount of
medicines<00:03:16.720> i<00:03:16.870> was<00:03:17.019> using<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.560> then<00:03:18.489> i<00:03:18.519> came

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
medicines i was using and then i came

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:24.920 
medicines i was using and then i came

upon homeopathy which is really in a way

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.469 
tiny amounts to that can do some nurse
damage<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.829> i<00:03:44.859> became<00:03:45.220> very<00:03:45.609> aware<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:46.120> that

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
damage so i became very aware of that

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.000 
damage so i became very aware of that
and<00:03:47.079> realized<00:03:47.799> that<00:03:48.159> that<00:03:49.090> same<00:03:49.389> system<00:03:50.010> for

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
and realized that that same system for

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.869 
and realized that that same system for
the<00:03:51.129> human<00:03:51.400> being<00:03:51.989> in<00:03:52.989> homeopathy<00:03:53.709> had<00:03:54.669> been

used in agriculture by rudolf steiner in

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.689 
used in agriculture by rudolf steiner in
what<00:04:00.729> was<00:04:00.970> called<00:04:01.739> biodynamic<00:04:02.739> farming<00:04:03.489> in

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
what was called biodynamic farming in

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.849 
what was called biodynamic farming in
which<00:04:04.540> he<00:04:04.780> had<00:04:04.900> actually<00:04:05.109> taken<00:04:05.409> some<00:04:05.829> of

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
which he had actually taken some of

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.159 
which he had actually taken some of
those<00:04:06.040> homeopathic<00:04:06.729> substances<00:04:07.449> and<00:04:07.569> sprayed

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
those homeopathic substances and sprayed

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.490 
those homeopathic substances and sprayed
him<00:04:08.319> on<00:04:08.409> the<00:04:08.500> plant<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.900> they<00:04:10.900> were<00:04:10.959> they<00:04:11.440> were

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
him on the plant and they were they were

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.680 
him on the plant and they were they were
they<00:04:11.799> were<00:04:12.659> substances<00:04:13.659> from<00:04:13.750> nature<00:04:14.229> such<00:04:15.159> as

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
they were substances from nature such as

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.860 
they were substances from nature such as
quartz<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.639> valerian<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:18.880> dandelion<00:04:19.599> and

quartz and valerian and dandelion and
oak<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.560> horse<00:04:21.519> tail<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:23.789> he<00:04:24.789> noticed<00:04:25.180> that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
oak and horse tail and he noticed that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.010 
oak and horse tail and he noticed that
spraying<00:04:26.139> them<00:04:26.349> on<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.650> plants<00:04:27.810> increase<00:04:28.810> the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
spraying them on the plants increase the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.810 
spraying them on the plants increase the
balance<00:04:29.409> and<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.710> strength<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.400> plants

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
balance and the strength of the plants

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.659 
balance and the strength of the plants
and<00:04:30.969> made<00:04:31.150> them<00:04:31.419> more<00:04:31.950> resistance<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.310> disease

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
and made them more resistance to disease

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.980 
and made them more resistance to disease
and<00:04:34.529> so<00:04:35.529> as<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:36.820> was<00:04:37.090> going<00:04:37.389> on<00:04:37.539> then<00:04:37.840> again

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
and so as that was going on then again

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.930 
and so as that was going on then again
in<00:04:38.289> my<00:04:38.409> medical<00:04:38.740> way<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.460> looking<00:04:39.789> at<00:04:39.880> things

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
in my medical way of looking at things

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.899 
in my medical way of looking at things
it<00:04:40.389> became<00:04:40.750> more<00:04:41.020> apparent<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.710> me<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:42.460> focus

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
it became more apparent to me to focus

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.350 
it became more apparent to me to focus
more<00:04:43.210> on<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.719> prevention<00:04:44.050> or<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.849> prevention

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
more on the prevention or the prevention

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.779 
more on the prevention or the prevention
of<00:04:46.479> disease<00:04:46.870> by<00:04:47.139> strengthening<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.130> organism

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
of disease by strengthening the organism

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.629 
of disease by strengthening the organism
which<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.840> what<00:04:50.020> fire<00:04:50.590> dynamics<00:04:50.830> does<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.520> the

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
which is what fire dynamics does to the

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.519 
which is what fire dynamics does to the
plant<00:04:51.909> that<00:04:52.870> that's<00:04:53.110> what<00:04:53.320> really

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
plant that that's what really

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.310 
plant that that's what really
alternative<00:04:54.219> medicine<00:04:54.580> does<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.599> makes<00:04:55.960> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
alternative medicine does it makes the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.250 
alternative medicine does it makes the
body<00:04:56.500> stronger<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.729> enhances<00:04:58.599> the<00:04:58.990> immune

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
body stronger it enhances the immune

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.180 
body stronger it enhances the immune
system<00:04:59.289> and<00:05:00.870> then<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.200> naturally<00:05:02.740> fights<00:05:02.979> off

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
system and then it naturally fights off

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.070 
system and then it naturally fights off
diseases<00:05:03.610> without<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.360> bullets<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:05.020> are

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
diseases without the bullets that are

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.250 
diseases without the bullets that are
used<00:05:05.409> in<00:05:05.590> traditional<00:05:05.800> medicine<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:07.419> in

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
used in traditional medicine and in

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.529 
used in traditional medicine and in
agriculture<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.279> chemicals<00:05:09.880> or<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.300> drugs

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
agriculture the chemicals or the drugs

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.269 
agriculture the chemicals or the drugs
and<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.710> back<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:12.669> forth<00:05:12.729> that's<00:05:13.240> how<00:05:13.450> my<00:05:13.690> mind

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:14.279 
and so back and forth that's how my mind

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:19.440 
and so back and forth that's how my mind
developed<00:05:15.279> in<00:05:15.400> terms<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:17.940> treating<00:05:18.940> plants

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
developed in terms of treating plants

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.420 
developed in terms of treating plants
and<00:05:19.599> people<00:05:20.020> pretty<00:05:20.440> much<00:05:20.529> the<00:05:20.800> same<00:05:20.979> trying

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
and people pretty much the same trying

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.990 
and people pretty much the same trying
to<00:05:21.520> put<00:05:21.700> them<00:05:21.820> in<00:05:21.909> balance<00:05:22.320> trying<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.469> not<00:05:24.190> not

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
to put them in balance trying to not not

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.540 
to put them in balance trying to not not
get<00:05:25.659> away<00:05:25.960> from<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.349> stress<00:05:26.409> idea<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:27.370> put

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
get away from the stress idea but put

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.430 
get away from the stress idea but put
the<00:05:27.669> mild<00:05:27.969> stress<00:05:28.419> on<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.779> system<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.320> it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
the mild stress on the system so it

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.110 
the mild stress on the system so it
builds<00:05:29.590> up<00:05:29.800> its<00:05:30.010> own<00:05:30.130> immune<00:05:30.460> system<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.090> that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
builds up its own immune system and that

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.990 
builds up its own immune system and that
basically<00:05:31.510> through<00:05:32.050> organics<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:33.000> through

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
basically through organics and through

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.269 
basically through organics and through
bio<00:05:34.210> dynamics<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.900> how<00:05:35.080> we've<00:05:35.289> evolved<00:05:36.099> here

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
bio dynamics is how we've evolved here

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.969 
bio dynamics is how we've evolved here
in<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.699> vineyard
