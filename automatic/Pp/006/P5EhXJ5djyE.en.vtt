hello<00:00:00.900> everyone<00:00:01.560> squirt<00:00:02.010> dude<00:00:02.220> here<00:00:02.510> today

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hello everyone squirt dude here today

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello everyone squirt dude here today
I'm<00:00:03.780> going<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.200> show<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.529> how<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:04.980> create<00:00:05.400> mini

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
I'm going to show you how to create mini

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.390 
I'm going to show you how to create mini
chests<00:00:06.180> now<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.319> sure<00:00:07.830> you've<00:00:08.010> seen<00:00:08.040> these

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
chests now I'm sure you've seen these

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.209 
chests now I'm sure you've seen these
before<00:00:08.550> however<00:00:09.540> I'm<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> showcase<00:00:10.889> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
before however I'm going to showcase a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.759 
before however I'm going to showcase a
method<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.240> will<00:00:12.360> probably<00:00:12.840> not<00:00:13.230> expect

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
method that you will probably not expect

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.189 
method that you will probably not expect
as<00:00:14.240> some<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.450> might<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.750> guessed<00:00:15.960> this

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
as some of you might have guessed this

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.260 
as some of you might have guessed this
uses<00:00:16.800> invisible<00:00:17.369> horses<00:00:17.880> no<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.140> course<00:00:19.800> not

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
uses invisible horses no of course not

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.400 
uses invisible horses no of course not
instead<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.539> system<00:00:21.930> works<00:00:22.170> by<00:00:22.380> using

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
instead this system works by using

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.040 
instead this system works by using
untextured<00:00:23.279> blocks

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
untextured blocks

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
untextured blocks
you<00:00:25.050> see<00:00:25.289> when<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> block<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.189> created<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you see when a block is created with the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.509 
you see when a block is created with the
unusable<00:00:27.689> damage<00:00:28.109> value<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.920> block<00:00:29.160> does<00:00:29.369> not

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
unusable damage value the block does not

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.999 
unusable damage value the block does not
render<00:00:29.730> properly<00:00:30.380> this<00:00:31.380> leaves<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
render properly this leaves it with a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.819 
render properly this leaves it with a
pink<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.550> black<00:00:32.700> checkered<00:00:33.239> texture

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
pink and black checkered texture

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.620 
pink and black checkered texture
although<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.040> block<00:00:35.340> appears<00:00:35.910> glitched<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
although the block appears glitched it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.139 
although the block appears glitched it
still<00:00:36.899> works<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.380> intended

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
still works as intended

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
still works as intended
another<00:00:39.149> weird<00:00:39.480> facet<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
another weird facet to this is that it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
another weird facet to this is that it
will<00:00:41.579> appear<00:00:41.969> invisible<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
will appear invisible if it is in the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.670 
will appear invisible if it is in the
face<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.890> player<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.170> essentially<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
face of the player so essentially this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.970 
face of the player so essentially this
can<00:00:46.950> allow<00:00:47.039> blocks<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.879> become<00:00:48.180> invisible

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
can allow blocks to become invisible

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.290 
can allow blocks to become invisible
this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> basis<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> system

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
this is the basis of how the system

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.959 
this is the basis of how the system
works<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:52.620> let's<00:00:53.100> take<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> rest

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
works now let's take a look at the rest

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.840 
works now let's take a look at the rest
of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> system<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.129> first<00:00:56.129> begins<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of the system it first begins with a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.020 
of the system it first begins with a
standard<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.539> block<00:00:57.780> lock<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.789> as

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
standard set block lock on the right as

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
standard set block lock on the right as
a<00:01:00.059> test<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.660> command<00:01:01.050> which<00:01:01.379> tests<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
a test for command which tests for a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
a test for command which tests for a
player<00:01:02.219> who<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.489> standing<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.180> front<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
player who is standing right in front of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
player who is standing right in front of
the<00:01:03.750> player<00:01:03.989> head<00:01:04.400> I'm<00:01:05.400> sure<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.850> notice<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the player head I'm sure you notice that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.859 
the player head I'm sure you notice that
abnormally<00:01:07.380> large<00:01:07.590> radius<00:01:08.159> value<00:01:08.520> well<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
abnormally large radius value well the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
abnormally large radius value well the
reason<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.380> such<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> strange<00:01:11.400> number<00:01:11.640> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
reason for such a strange number is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
reason for such a strange number is
because<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> causes<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.200> integer<00:01:13.530> overload

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
because it causes an integer overload

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.450 
because it causes an integer overload
which<00:01:14.850> reduces<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> search<00:01:15.900> radius<00:01:16.259> from<00:01:17.189> 5

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
which reduces the search radius from 5

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.440 
which reduces the search radius from 5
blocks<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> 1<00:01:19.759> once<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.909> detects<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
blocks down to 1 once it detects the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
blocks down to 1 once it detects the
player<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.900> location<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.830> then

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
player in that location it then

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
player in that location it then
activates<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.880> clone<00:01:24.150> command<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.590> cloning

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
activates a clone command at the cloning

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.679 
activates a clone command at the cloning
coordinates<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> glitched<00:01:27.090> hopper<00:01:27.479> with

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
coordinates as a glitched hopper with

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.080 
coordinates as a glitched hopper with
the<00:01:27.840> items<00:01:28.189> just<00:01:29.189> don't<00:01:29.400> forget<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> rename

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the items just don't forget to rename

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.350 
the items just don't forget to rename
the<00:01:30.270> hopper<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.829> final<00:01:32.189> command<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.030> little

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the hopper the final command is a little

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
the hopper the final command is a little
unconventional<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.770> still<00:01:35.009> does<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
unconventional but it still does the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
unconventional but it still does the
trick<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> player<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.500> inside

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
trick you see when a player is inside

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
trick you see when a player is inside
one<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.460> technical<00:01:39.000> blocks<00:01:39.270> they

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
one of these technical blocks they

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
one of these technical blocks they
cannot<00:01:40.079> escape<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> block<00:01:41.460> must<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
cannot escape it so the block must be

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
cannot escape it so the block must be
deleted<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.799> command<00:01:44.130> does

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
deleted this is what this command does

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.340 
deleted this is what this command does
and<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.000> does<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> by<00:01:45.450> detecting<00:01:45.990> where<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and it does it by detecting where the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
and it does it by detecting where the
player<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> facing<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.210> player<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
player is facing if the player is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.920 
player is facing if the player is
looking<00:01:48.930> down<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.530> will<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.950> activate<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> if

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
looking down it will not activate but if

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.510 
looking down it will not activate but if
the<00:01:52.110> player<00:01:52.320> looks<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.070> block<00:01:53.280> gets

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the player looks up the block gets

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.440 
the player looks up the block gets
removed<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.619> there<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.310> very

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
removed and there you have it a very

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.420 
removed and there you have it a very
abnormal<00:01:57.500> system<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.740> creates<00:01:59.130> pretty

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
abnormal system that creates pretty
