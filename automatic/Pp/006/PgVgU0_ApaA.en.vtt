okay<00:00:04.340> we're<00:00:04.550> going<00:00:04.670> to<00:00:04.730> talk<00:00:04.819> about<00:00:04.970> phishing

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
okay we're going to talk about phishing

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.709 
okay we're going to talk about phishing
a<00:00:05.390> to<00:00:05.720> fly<00:00:06.200> leader<00:00:06.710> system<00:00:07.310> a<00:00:08.090> couple

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
a to fly leader system a couple

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.270 
a to fly leader system a couple
different<00:00:09.020> ways<00:00:09.049> to<00:00:09.290> do<00:00:09.410> it<00:00:09.440> here<00:00:09.740> is<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:10.070> real

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
different ways to do it here is the real

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.390 
different ways to do it here is the real
basic<00:00:10.910> way<00:00:11.120> we've<00:00:11.389> got<00:00:11.510> your<00:00:11.690> looped<00:00:12.410> fly<00:00:13.130> line

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
basic way we've got your looped fly line

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.570 
basic way we've got your looped fly line
and<00:00:13.760> let's<00:00:14.210> say<00:00:14.420> we<00:00:15.050> loop<00:00:15.290> on<00:00:15.559> a<00:00:15.920> nine-foot

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
and let's say we loop on a nine-foot

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.050 
and let's say we loop on a nine-foot
leader<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:18.590> would<00:00:18.770> be<00:00:18.890> nine<00:00:19.099> feet<00:00:19.130> from

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
leader and this would be nine feet from

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.580 
leader and this would be nine feet from
to<00:00:20.270> here<00:00:21.730> we're<00:00:22.730> gonna<00:00:22.820> tie<00:00:23.029> on<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.570> big<00:00:24.109> dry<00:00:24.320> fly

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
to here we're gonna tie on a big dry fly

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.800 
to here we're gonna tie on a big dry fly
let's<00:00:24.859> say<00:00:24.980> 1/2<00:00:25.279> down<00:00:25.580> golden<00:00:26.240> or<00:00:26.510> something

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
let's say 1/2 down golden or something

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.939 
let's say 1/2 down golden or something
of<00:00:27.230> that<00:00:27.289> nature<00:00:27.730> big<00:00:28.730> monster<00:00:29.180> dry<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:30.590> one

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
of that nature big monster dry the one

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.589 
of that nature big monster dry the one
way<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.189> do<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.820> this<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.000> I<00:00:32.180> think<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.480> is

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
way to do it and this is I think this is

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.090 
way to do it and this is I think this is
kind<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.809> where<00:00:32.930> hopper<00:00:33.199> dropper<00:00:33.530> method

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
kind of where hopper dropper method

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.190 
kind of where hopper dropper method
started<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.879> it<00:00:35.210> works<00:00:35.510> really<00:00:35.780> great<00:00:35.930> on

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
started and it works really great on

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.590 
started and it works really great on
small<00:00:36.440> streams<00:00:36.710> around<00:00:36.980> here<00:00:37.280> where<00:00:38.239> you're

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
small streams around here where you're

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.799 
small streams around here where you're
not<00:00:38.809> requiring<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:40.210> secondary<00:00:41.210> flag<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.660> get

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
not requiring the secondary flag to get

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.690 
not requiring the secondary flag to get
very<00:00:41.989> deep<00:00:42.200> if<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:42.469> want<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.680> fish<00:00:42.770> it<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.520> fly

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
very deep if you want to fish it to fly

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.850 
very deep if you want to fish it to fly
system<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.180> you<00:00:44.239> want<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.540> nymph<00:00:44.809> to<00:00:45.140> just

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
system and you want the nymph to just

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.340 
system and you want the nymph to just
kind<00:00:46.040> of<00:00:46.070> trail<00:00:46.309> along<00:00:46.610> maybe<00:00:47.000> maybe<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.260> know

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
kind of trail along maybe maybe you know

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.319 
kind of trail along maybe maybe you know
drop<00:00:48.649> down<00:00:48.860> below<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.280> column<00:00:49.520> if<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:50.210> is

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
drop down below the column if this is

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.760 
drop down below the column if this is
the<00:00:50.420> surface<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:50.960> know<00:00:51.050> drops<00:00:51.320> down<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.559> little

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
the surface you know drops down a little

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.220 
the surface you know drops down a little
bit<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.309> just<00:00:52.550> tie<00:00:52.940> another<00:00:53.180> clinch<00:00:53.570> knot<00:00:53.629> right

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
bit I just tie another clinch knot right

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.350 
bit I just tie another clinch knot right
there<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.770> bend<00:00:54.949> of<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.070> hook<00:00:55.149> right<00:00:56.149> and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
there to the bend of the hook right and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.569 
there to the bend of the hook right and
I've<00:00:56.420> got<00:00:56.600> two<00:00:56.809> flies<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:57.980> that's<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.430> real

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
I've got two flies that's that's a real

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.150 
I've got two flies that's that's a real
basic<00:00:59.030> way<00:00:59.180> we've<00:00:59.660> done<00:00:59.870> that<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.770> problem

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
basic way we've done that the problem

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.549 
basic way we've done that the problem
with<00:01:01.340> that<00:01:01.370> is<00:01:01.760> if<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:02.300> if<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.079> run<00:01:03.320> this

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
with that is if you if you run this

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.070 
with that is if you if you run this
really<00:01:04.100> long<00:01:04.399> it's<00:01:05.089> just<00:01:05.180> really<00:01:05.539> cumbersome

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
really long it's just really cumbersome

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.710 
really long it's just really cumbersome
to<00:01:06.259> cast<00:01:06.470> or<00:01:06.740> if<00:01:07.160> you<00:01:07.250> put<00:01:07.399> a<00:01:07.460> size<00:01:07.700> 10<00:01:08.060> fly<00:01:08.390> down

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
to cast or if you put a size 10 fly down

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.010 
to cast or if you put a size 10 fly down
here<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:10.070> size<00:01:10.310> 8<00:01:11.060> fly<00:01:11.450> up<00:01:11.659> there<00:01:11.840> because

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
here and a size 8 fly up there because

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.600 
here and a size 8 fly up there because
you<00:01:12.229> need<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.530> hold<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:12.890> size<00:01:13.040> 10<00:01:13.250> fly<00:01:13.460> up

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
you need it to hold this size 10 fly up

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.010 
you need it to hold this size 10 fly up
and<00:01:13.820> you've<00:01:14.210> got<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:14.420> distance<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:14.990> just

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
and you've got this distance it's just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.109 
and you've got this distance it's just
you're<00:01:15.350> casting<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:16.040> really<00:01:16.400> heavy<00:01:16.549> flies<00:01:16.850> and

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
you're casting to really heavy flies and

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.880 
you're casting to really heavy flies and
it's<00:01:17.240> really<00:01:17.479> okay<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.470> I'm<00:01:18.590> going<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.770> talk

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's really okay so I'm going to talk

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.940 
it's really okay so I'm going to talk
about<00:01:19.189> an<00:01:19.400> easier<00:01:19.850> way<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.600> set<00:01:21.229> up<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.740> fly

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
about an easier way to set up a to fly

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.760 
about an easier way to set up a to fly
system<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:23.950> will<00:01:24.950> cast<00:01:25.250> way<00:01:25.700> better<00:01:25.909> for<00:01:26.030> you

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
system that will cast way better for you

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.950 
system that will cast way better for you
fly<00:01:27.770> line<00:01:27.979> loop<00:01:28.250> here<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:29.890> fly<00:01:30.890> line<00:01:31.210> leader<00:01:32.210> fly

fly line loop here a fly line leader fly
leader<00:01:33.350> here<00:01:33.950> 9<00:01:34.820> feet<00:01:37.630> I'm<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:38.930> come<00:01:39.140> up

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
leader here 9 feet I'm going to come up

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.700 
leader here 9 feet I'm going to come up
5<00:01:39.979> feet<00:01:40.880> at<00:01:41.299> least<00:01:41.390> maybe<00:01:42.200> sometimes<00:01:42.590> I'll

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
5 feet at least maybe sometimes I'll

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.429 
5 feet at least maybe sometimes I'll
come<00:01:42.860> up<00:01:43.009> even<00:01:43.159> higher<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.750> I'm<00:01:44.840> going<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.049> cut

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
come up even higher and I'm going to cut

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.670 
come up even higher and I'm going to cut
that<00:01:45.680> leader<00:01:46.070> right<00:01:46.399> there<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.939> tie<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.810> up

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
that leader right there and tie on up

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.620 
that leader right there and tie on up
with<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> blood<00:01:49.640> knot<00:01:49.850> I'm<00:01:49.970> going<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.180> retie<00:01:50.600> it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
with a blood knot I'm going to retie it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.569 
with a blood knot I'm going to retie it
so<00:01:50.990> I've<00:01:51.110> cut<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.710> retie<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.430> that's

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
so I've cut it and retie it and that's

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.690 
so I've cut it and retie it and that's
what's<00:01:52.820> sitting<00:01:53.119> there<00:01:53.299> right<00:01:53.479> now<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:54.610> as<00:01:55.610> a

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
what's sitting there right now is a as a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.800 
what's sitting there right now is a as a
blood<00:01:56.000> knot<00:01:58.540> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
blood knot and

really important it stays off the line
no<00:03:24.480> drop<00:03:24.720> or<00:03:24.900> system<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.230> perfect<00:03:25.620> though<00:03:25.739> I'm

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
no drop or system is perfect though I'm

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.259 
no drop or system is perfect though I'm
not<00:03:26.069> saying<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.340> multi-angle<00:03:26.819> but<00:03:27.150> it

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
not saying that multi-angle but it

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.479 
not saying that multi-angle but it
certainly<00:03:27.450> do<00:03:27.690> better<00:03:27.959> than<00:03:28.200> putting<00:03:28.380> 5<00:03:28.829> X<00:03:29.130> 3

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
certainly do better than putting 5 X 3

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.819 
certainly do better than putting 5 X 3
to<00:03:29.760> 5<00:03:29.910> inches<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.239> 5<00:03:30.540> X<00:03:30.780> double<00:03:31.200> Sergent<00:03:31.560> looped

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.599 
onto the 30-pound
this<00:03:34.230> will<00:03:34.380> do<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> tremendous<00:03:34.739> amount<00:03:35.069> better

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
this will do a tremendous amount better

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.090 
this will do a tremendous amount better
than<00:03:35.819> 5<00:03:36.060> X<00:03:36.269> 2<00:03:36.540> X<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.870> really<00:03:36.989> important<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.620> how

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
than 5 X 2 X is really important and how

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.920 
than 5 X 2 X is really important and how
you<00:03:38.130> going<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.400> use<00:03:38.519> bigger<00:03:38.819> but<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.810> know

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
you going to use bigger but you know

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.809 
you going to use bigger but you know
what<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.109> can<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.410> don't<00:03:40.560> want<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> fly<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.069> be

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
what it can you don't want the fly to be

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.940 
what it can you don't want the fly to be
too<00:03:42.030> rigid<00:03:42.299> either<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:43.260> independent

too rigid either this independent
movement<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.549> think<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.910> great<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.420> allows

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
movement I think is great this allows

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.360 
movement I think is great this allows
you<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.049> fish<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.859> like<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> strike
