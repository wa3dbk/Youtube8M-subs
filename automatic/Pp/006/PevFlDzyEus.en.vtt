the front ones you want to build this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.259 
the front ones you want to build this
and<00:03:11.380> those<00:03:12.190> are<00:03:12.220> chains<00:03:12.610> around<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.030> then<00:03:13.180> you

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
and those are chains around so then you

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.170 
and those are chains around so then you
can<00:03:13.390> stick<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:14.340> mean<00:03:15.340> I'm<00:03:15.640> going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.060> make<00:03:16.150> a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
can stick I mean I'm going to make a

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.640 
can stick I mean I'm going to make a
front<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:16.690> but<00:03:16.989> if<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.260> want<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.500> make<00:03:17.620> one

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
front one but if you want to make one

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.210 
front one but if you want to make one
for<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.040> back<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.900> use<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.530> which<00:03:21.010> is

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
for the back and just use that which is

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.680 
for the back and just use that which is
just<00:03:21.400> simply<00:03:22.140> those<00:03:23.140> two<00:03:23.410> pieces<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:24.690> just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
just simply those two pieces and just

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.620 
just simply those two pieces and just
connect<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.590> like<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:27.390> time<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.420> should

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
connect it like that time you should

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.430 
connect it like that time you should
have<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.080> ship<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:33.580> want<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.820> take<00:03:34.440> two

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
have the ship then you want to take two

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.330 
have the ship then you want to take two
of<00:03:35.470> these<00:03:35.650> wheels<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:37.200> then

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.900 

line<00:03:41.300> them<00:03:41.569> up<00:03:41.900> like<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.709> then<00:03:45.709> get<00:03:46.489> one<00:03:46.670> of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
line them up like so and then get one of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.259 
line them up like so and then get one of
these<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:48.069> believe<00:03:49.450> it's<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:51.790> second<00:03:52.790> smallest

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
these I believe it's the second smallest

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.570 
these I believe it's the second smallest
one<00:03:56.049> aren't<00:03:57.049> going<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.290> stick<00:03:57.500> in<00:03:57.650> there<00:03:57.860> but

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
one aren't going to stick in there but

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.380 
one aren't going to stick in there but
your<00:03:58.760> name<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.209> it's<00:03:59.450> like<00:03:59.750> that<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:01.849> then<00:04:02.060> put

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
your name so it's like that and then put

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.860 
your name so it's like that and then put
that<00:04:02.420> in<00:04:03.069> that<00:04:04.069> one<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:06.170> one<00:04:06.739> there<00:04:07.870> then

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
that in that one that one there then

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.819 
that in that one that one there then
don't<00:04:09.349> take<00:04:09.650> one<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.489> these<00:04:11.380> it's<00:04:12.380> just<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.680> the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
don't take one of these it's just of the

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.650 
don't take one of these it's just of the
three<00:04:13.130> long<00:04:13.370> ones<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.690> put<00:04:15.170> that<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.450> may

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
three long ones and put that that I may

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.000 
three long ones and put that that I may
end<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.900> changing<00:04:18.139> this<00:04:18.440> because<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.799> can't

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
end up changing this because I can't

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.300 
end up changing this because I can't
fully<00:04:19.250> remember<00:04:19.459> how<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:19.880> did<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:21.160> sorry<00:04:22.160> about

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
fully remember how I did it sorry about

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.800 
fully remember how I did it sorry about
that<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.910> then<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:26.000> want<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.270> get<00:04:26.450> one<00:04:26.690> of

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
that and then you want to get one of

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.879 
that and then you want to get one of
these<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.889> these<00:04:28.100> blue<00:04:28.400> which<00:04:28.910> has<00:04:29.090> got<00:04:29.270> the

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
these and these blue which has got the

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.879 
these and these blue which has got the
CrossFit<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.460> connector<00:04:32.240> pin<00:04:32.889> connector

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
CrossFit and the connector pin connector

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.730 
CrossFit and the connector pin connector
pin<00:04:34.100> bit<00:04:34.460> in<00:04:34.639> there<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:36.110> put<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:37.010> in<00:04:37.340> there<00:04:38.030> and

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
pin bit in there and put it in there and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.300 
pin bit in there and put it in there and
then<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:43.850> then<00:04:44.060> when<00:04:44.510> you<00:04:44.630> turn<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.310> that

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
then that so then when you turn it that

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:54.550 
then that so then when you turn it that
gives<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:48.010> your<00:04:49.030> motion<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.570> leg<00:04:53.560> right

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
gives you your motion of the leg right

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.740 
gives you your motion of the leg right
so<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.880> then<00:04:57.280> have<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.400> get<00:04:58.520> yourself<00:04:58.750> more

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
so and then have to get yourself more

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.620 
so and then have to get yourself more
these<00:05:02.080> connect<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.229> like<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.970> well<00:05:04.970> or

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
these connect it like that well or

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.620 
these connect it like that well or
easier<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.610> put<00:05:07.610> on<00:05:07.639> there<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.970> pick<00:05:10.970> up<00:05:11.270> like

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
easier to put on there and pick up like

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:27.200 
easier to put on there and pick up like
so<00:05:15.639> yep<00:05:16.639> ego<00:05:20.500> ego<00:05:21.500> still<00:05:22.099> works

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.270 

like<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.720> want<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.110> fit<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.620> out<00:05:32.770> with

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
like so and you want to fit it out with

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.750 
like so and you want to fit it out with
that<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:36.220> just<00:05:37.150> like<00:05:37.330> how<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.690> was<00:05:38.760> and

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
that and that just like how it was and

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.300 
that and that just like how it was and
then<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.450> front<00:05:40.690> ones<00:05:41.100> stick<00:05:42.100> down<00:05:42.370> on<00:05:44.310> and

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
then the front ones stick down on and

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.130 
then the front ones stick down on and
you<00:05:45.430> want<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.900> put<00:05:46.900> that<00:05:46.930> there<00:05:47.440> and<00:05:47.940> then<00:05:49.140> put

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
you want to put that there and then put

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.540 
you want to put that there and then put
this<00:05:50.350> piece<00:05:50.800> on<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:53.890> that<00:05:54.040> and<00:05:54.220> then<00:05:54.400> how

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
this piece on like that and then how

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.090 
this piece on like that and then how
it's<00:05:54.730> upsetting<00:05:54.910> like<00:05:55.450> that<00:05:55.800> then<00:05:56.800> when<00:05:57.010> it

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
it's upsetting like that then when it

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:07.290 
it's upsetting like that then when it
moves<00:06:02.250> like<00:06:03.250> that<00:06:03.280> also<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:06.760> also<00:06:06.880> want<00:06:07.060> to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
moves like that also you also want to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.420 
moves like that also you also want to
get<00:06:07.450> one<00:06:07.750> of<00:06:07.870> these<00:06:07.960> pieces<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:10.000> you<00:06:10.180> smooth

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
get one of these pieces and you smooth

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.480 
get one of these pieces and you smooth
four<00:06:12.430> by<00:06:12.610> one<00:06:12.820> and<00:06:13.060> then<00:06:14.010> just<00:06:15.010> because<00:06:15.340> it's

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
four by one and then just because it's

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.890 
four by one and then just because it's
helped<00:06:16.590> stabilize<00:06:18.300> then<00:06:19.300> on<00:06:19.450> the<00:06:19.570> other<00:06:19.600> side

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
helped stabilize then on the other side

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:29.690 
helped stabilize then on the other side
of<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.200> one<00:06:21.600> want<00:06:22.600> to<00:06:22.840> just<00:06:24.780> like<00:06:25.780> that<00:06:26.100> and

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.430 

you<00:06:30.700> want<00:06:30.910> to<00:06:31.320> get<00:06:32.320> and<00:06:32.800> now<00:06:33.600> this<00:06:34.600> is<00:06:34.930> quite

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
you want to get and now this is quite

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.800 
you want to get and now this is quite
important<00:06:35.980> but<00:06:36.550> just<00:06:36.880> this<00:06:37.150> piece<00:06:37.420> in<00:06:37.660> this

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
important but just this piece in this

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
important but just this piece in this
piece<00:06:39.630> you<00:06:40.630> have<00:06:40.750> to<00:06:40.900> use<00:06:40.930> it<00:06:41.260> to<00:06:41.440> stick<00:06:41.680> it

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
piece you have to use it to stick it

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.470 
piece you have to use it to stick it
through<00:06:42.840> there<00:06:43.840> so<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:44.860> goes<00:06:45.040> like<00:06:45.130> that<00:06:45.490> then

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
through there so it goes like that then

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.760
