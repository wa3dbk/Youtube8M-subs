 what is her connection to the hotline yes 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
 perhaps only that both games 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.100
 are very violent top-down 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.860
 shooters 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.420
 and then go only differences in the plot to us 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.189
 it is necessary to calculate the leader of the squad 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 whose location is unknown and 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.850
 destroy it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.900
 opponents will be followed 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 canonical time dilation of the project 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 also worth noting the excellent visual 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820
 style and non-linear capability 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.610

 they managed to create a set of toys 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 which can be considered the very Andy 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.360
 which in the gaming industry so much 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.370

 chose based on cyberpunk illustration 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.319
 in the end, this art became the winner 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.180
 theme you have to think out 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.579

 absolutely nothing was known but here 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.370
 just recently the creators of this toy 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.870
 13 students from the University of Rotterdam 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.610
 capsules decided to tell all that 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.390
 the public was interested in the game 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.250
 soulbound 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.409

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.760
 different networks that work 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.930
 each of the 13 members of their team 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.030
 they will continue to work on 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.640
 playing only as a studio thought and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.040
 the developer market is not on a ghost town 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.849
 to incense that never shines me to 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.190
 tanke on that 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.139
 Moreover, the street and about Kiev flooded 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.570

 wishing to enter the dangerous land on 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.760
 at first glance it seems that salman iron 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.419
 simple data of the roof ram but not all so 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.460
 simply 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.690
 the protagonist of the extreme game is weak and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.130
 goes to the promised land 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.990
 just a couple of strokes 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.820
 in order to survive in a dangerous world you 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.010
 need to use in food games then 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.060
 what distinguishes it from other developers 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.830
 gave us the opportunity to catch 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.450
 protagonists to further they 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.729

 This moment is the only features 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.139
 implemented in the game in the future I promise 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.970
 crafting system 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.010
