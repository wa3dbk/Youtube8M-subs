00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 very good all kids welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.759
 a new video gave and I'm here playing 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.130
 to my first game of battlefield 4 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.360
 I started let's see what day I've left 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.070
 put on all against all because not 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.690
 I want to start with things roll up to 3 or 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.370
 to start with something more direct to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.750
 do a little bit of control and so on 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.490
 Well you know that I played the beta but 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 since then I have not touched the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 game so I prefer to do little to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.449
 little bit we're going to catch up here I do not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.369
 I know the maps so I'm a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.369
 little bit as well as investigating 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 to carry each batch 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.770
 come to appear children of bitches what 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.100
 handsome brings you the laser of the companions 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.100
 and everyone 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.670
 Where are you 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 you that the grenade is to what is more 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.820
 rare that it stays like sparkling and it 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.880
 they have already got for trio what a handsome 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.880
 white and the last snow 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.170
 Here we go 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.820
 at least we're fine going well 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.820
 here there must be another 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 He did not know 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 I knew it I knew it guys 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.380
 to support just in case 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.460
 the others 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.750
 the chivas with full shotguns 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.300
 bust the two first the first 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.180
 starting already quite 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.080
 It is also worth to see what else Huesca 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.720
 great 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.250
 you see that you flip 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.250
 you see that you flipas lad 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.370
 how did you come here with the team 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.380
 contrary 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.840
 that he did not want to die by the way 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.759
 there does not seem to be any more than the other 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 It seems that he is sucked and he does not know 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.880
 that we are here so there are here 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.269
 back to see if we catch it by the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.489
 back and we give it to him but friends 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.970
 it looks like they have been charged more for 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.970
 this other side 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.939
 it seems to me that here riffraff does not 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 I do not know if they come out there but I 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.680
 just in case he threw it there it seems good 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 not this way 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.909
 of all and if there is one that are coming 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.689
 around here it seems like I'm going to 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.689
 get ahead a little 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.250
 let's go ahead here a little bit 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.250
 the twine is a kit wei wei wei wei 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.430
 sometimes we get together again we move forward 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.950
 we will lose because they will be by 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.950
 down here 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.650
 to see and see down here 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.269
 nobody number I think 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.610
 somewhere they have to have hui or not 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.490
 of so much shooting 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.690
 It seems to be on the other side of the 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.040
 parking so that we go runs runs 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.730
 run runs let's try to catch the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.730
 below or something 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.670
 several are there then you have to see 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.100
 some way over here to get in there 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.210
 inside we do not think that you do not save these 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.330
 stairs 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.990
 It's worth here here or here in this 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.140
 team has to have someone 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.310
 they burst us or they burst or uncle 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.160
 boy or move mine were all the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.690
 you all know that I can appear with 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.950
 someone from me from my patrol or something 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.680
 because I'm in some patrol I do not 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.510
 I imagine the symphony yes but both 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.550
 he detects cannes pinched but I can do 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.530
 so they appear or does not continue without equal be 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.250
 all against all appears is where 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.250
 appears endless 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.859
 and there was one that marked it 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.859
 to see below 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.879
 from below it seems that nothing 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:21.580
 son of a bitch Juan not seen the poet and not 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.730
 He saw nothing launching rockets male hosts 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.350
 So there we go and we go to 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.120
 fill anything the petal too fat 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.840
 the petals very fat and we put a 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.840
 grenade and really 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.500
 for that we 're going, that's what better to leave 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.500
 for another side 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:59.460
 appeared from the first to the eighth and 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:03.740
 Milk kid you have to keep killing 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.740

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.580
 it really gets cold or it goes through there 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.580

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.690

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.010

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.490

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.910

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.800
