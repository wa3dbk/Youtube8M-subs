00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 Well, tell me what the requirements are for 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.530
 most tackle thin fishing line 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.530
 small hook 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.150
 and more expensive on and float 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.110
 In general, the place where there is a fish was kind 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.840
 right now again 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.190
 large Zaporizhia 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.700
 but she had a case of help recently it rained 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.750
 it's such 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.970
 low is the so-called rainfall 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.650
 and at this time the line fisherman jumps 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.160
 we can successfully use which 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:06.860
 fishing is rafting it turns out yes to 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.140
 wiring and how deep is it yesterday here 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.870
 somewhere up to two meters well, and the way 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.130
 fishing from the bottom happens or yes because 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.440
 that top 80 is actually 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.770
 baited hook dragging along the bottom to 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.229
 approach for tighten it a little 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.830
 yes still not weak mostly wind 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.880
 big wait if you are loaded in the morning 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.700
 the fish starts to develop then there is no 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.520
 sense her to lure further what 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.420
 the fish stops responding begins so 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.250
 bait and so I understand in terms of most 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.370
 do not bother too much too 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.190
 there is anew all the same but still the community 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.360
 type of silver to us if good 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.940
 principle what you feed on yours 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.920
 if for example hold catch 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.630
 who basically 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.110
 use who than feeds but this is a fisherman 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.259
 use your specific or 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.259
 skill or as a way 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.890
 Well, today in this case, what 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:28.690
 prikormka you what it seems 100 entered 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:28.690
 and on the remains of crackers so well or 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.519
 well or little maggot a bit and standard 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.519
 implicated in the river water itself 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.160
 one has to alone and no matter how it 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.319
 don't go about the same big numbers here 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.319
 it's impossible to catch it yourself funny 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.030
 here is your standard 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.610
 caravan 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.150
 small more often 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.690
 yes even that his bullet comes across 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.290
 this sun or pearl water like me 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.480
 but 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.000
 blow up but 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.570
 often enough 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 trophies will be simpler but this is a topic 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.910
 separate 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.660
 fishing box of an ode to dinner 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.660
 no attacks 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.560
 and oscam place is carbines
