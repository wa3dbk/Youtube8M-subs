00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.569
 Hello everyone! I am Daryl Winkelmann of the HP Industry Standard Server Marketing Department. 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:20.619
 In this coffee guide lecture unit, introduce the new listing 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.039
 The DL360e Gen8 product gives you an idea of ​​what these high-density platforms offer. 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.160
 Bring value to companies of all sizes 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.509
 Whether you have specific infrastructure requirements, such as a domain control station, 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.220
 Or general application requirements 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.350
 Maybe you are responsible for maintaining the cluster environment with Windows Server. 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.690
 DL360e is the most convenient choice 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.890
 The design concept of the DL360e, 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.430
 It is to assist customers of traditional 300 series servers, although they are currently very satisfied with stability and reliability. 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 just now 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.650
 But it may be desirable to reduce the cost of acquisition to reduce capital expenditures. 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.960
 Compared to other servers 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100
 Another design focus is to meet the needs of traditional 100 Series customers. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.019
 For customers 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.389
 In addition to making them reasonably priced, they can also take into account basic characteristics such as maintenance capabilities and 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.080
 Management ability 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.430
 So what are the advantages of DL360e? 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 First of all, in addition to performance, this server also provides the flexibility of the storage mechanism. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 This system supports LFF and SFF hard disks. 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.560
 Let customers choose storage capacity and speed according to their needs 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.080
 Meet individual needs 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 Customers can also purchase a safety frame to make more copper walls 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.409
 On the front of the server 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.470
 The DL360e is a server that provides basic functions. 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.719
 So the standard version comes with a Dynamic Smart Array smart array. 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.140
 This product also supports all upright smart array cards. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.930
 If the customer wants to harmonize specifications or needs other features 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.060
 Second, the server's repair capabilities and all ProLiant product lines, 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.510
 Have been greatly improved in this generation 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.880
 Just take the DL360e's case and you can see the difference. 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.680
 We will abolish the deflector this time, so that you can see at a glance. 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.110
 In addition, the design of the cable has been improved, and the wiring is always clean along the corners. 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.240
 The PCI riser solution comes with easy-to-use hand-turn screws. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.190
 Easy to disassemble and replace. 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.880
 HP's Smart Socket Guide gives customers the perfect processor to install (no longer afraid of bending pins) 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 The slide rails have also been redesigned. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.209
 Not only can it be fixed in the cabinet, but the server can also be easily placed into the rails. 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.669
 Optional wiring bracket 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.679
 Also, if you don't want to repair in the cabinet, we will continue to supply 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.709
 Improved new generation of friction rails (Friction Rail). 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.279
 Finally, all Gen8 servers have built-in iLO4. 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.949
 Let customers have HP's quality management system from Haohao. 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.809
 However, this point will be described later. 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.899
 Now let's take a look at some other features of DL360e. 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.299
 Support for 2 Intel Xeon® E5-2400 series 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.849
 4, 6, and 8 cores with the highest processor speed 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.339
 High-speed 2.4 GHz DDR3 memory speeds up to 1600MHz. 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.729
 Capacity up to 384GB, launched 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.080
 32GB 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.799
 Load-reduced DIMMs 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.309
 Up to 4 LFF or 8 SFF hard drives can be installed inside. 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.390
 Including SAS, SATA and solid state drives, 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.040
 So you can get 12TB of storage when you buy 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.939
 On a mini server 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.330
 In terms of network connection, the standard equipment is a four-inch network card, 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.019
 There is also a full-height half-length expansion slot and a half-height expansion slot. 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.110
 And expansion slots (both PCIe Gen 3) 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.769
 Can accommodate most of the optional interface cards, including the NVidia Quadro 4000. 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.189
 The Gen8 system supports power supplies with up to 94% power savings. 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.180
 Can be paired with HP's smart PDUs, 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.139
 Make the entire server more power efficient. 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.379
 This feature allows you to save more power and resources and ultimately contribute 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.599
 Profit in the entire computer room 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.159
 Let customers speed up erection, enablement, and update systems and 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.190
 Solve the problem 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.709
 Because of the faster speed provided by Intelligent Provisioning 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.769
 And features such as Active Health and Proactive Support 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.389
 Smart Socket Guide is a major innovation of HP 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.699
 The most common headaches that customers typically install when installing processors: 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:52.799
 Bending pin 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.999
 We can see in the picture, 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.589
 The spring controls the action of the fixed latch in synchronism with the blue housing that covers the processor. 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.400
 Avoid touching many pins on your fingers, 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.799
 Causing the pin to be damaged and shutting down 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.689
 The Gen8 is also equipped with HP's new Smart Drive carrier. New vehicle is smarter 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.409
 Previous generation to allow for things like more memory in Blade servers and compared to the old version, but also allows the Blade server to accommodate more memory, 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.399
 Let DL have more storage space. 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.709
 Intuitive design, activity indicator can indicate hard drive 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.339
 In operation 

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.359
 The fault LED can instantly indicate the status of the hard disk. 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.229
 The "Do Not Remove" light is displayed when the hard disk performs important tasks. 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.639
 (eg rebuilding a RAID group) 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.160
 Reduce the risk of data corruption. 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.440
 PCI module disassembly is also easy 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.160
 Hand screw fixing 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.379
 The standard iLO Management Engine is built into all ProLiant Gen8 servers. 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.159
 This is great news for customers who want to enhance this feature. 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.659
 This is especially true for customers with older servers. 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.259
 In addition to the previous generations of remote consoles, remote boot, virtual media features, 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.689
 The new version also adds four new features in iLO 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.419
 Management Engine. The first feature is Intelligent Provisioning, which is also enhanced 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.199
 In addition to retaining the benefits of SmartStart, ProLiant Service Pack, and HP SUM, 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.660
 Easy to learn and use, 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.149
 And it’s built directly into the motherboard for immediate use. 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.510
 No need to rummage through a bunch of DVDs. 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.330
 Next is a lot of customers looking through the autumn, this time finally launched on Gen8 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.180
 Agentless Management System 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.099
 Basic hardware status monitoring and alerting capabilities can now be performed directly by iLO 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:19.979
 Hardware 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.259
 So cross-platform and cross-processor 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.960
 We invested a lot of time, money and manpower to make the Gen8 product line the best. 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.000
 When such high quality products are also faulty, 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.420
 However, in terms of any technology, some servers have accidental problems. 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.020
 Very difficult to reproduce 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.009
 These problems may also escape the eyes of the timed diagnosis system, and the repairs will be abolished. 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.409
 The new version of Active Health System from Gen8 is a resident diagnostic system. 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.300
 Can continuously check the important information of the system, 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.960
 Such as continuous transmission of temperature data, configuration changes and all warning records, 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.970
 Allows you to analyze the root cause of the problem faster 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.639
 Solving problems is also faster 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.919
 Finally, the iLO Management Engine also gives you faster access to HP Insight 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.089
 Remote Support services 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.020
 This is HP's "call back" remote customer service software all year round. 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.699
 My explanation today is to summarize the HP ProLiant DL360e Gen8. 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.859
 Thank you for taking the time to learn all the new features. 

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:14.889
 The new features offered by the new ProLiant server are exciting 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.509
 This server has the computing and storage capacity and the size of the 1U platform. 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.789
 Can meet your basic needs. 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:27.789
 I am Daryl Winkelmann. Thank you for watching this unit coffee instruction lecture.
