00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
skin only or a brand new character from
the<00:01:38.939> movie<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.509> last<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.250> sure

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the movie the last that is I'm not sure

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
the movie the last that is I'm not sure
about<00:01:41.640> chapter<00:01:42.329> seven<00:01:42.630> hundred<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.020> beyond

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
about chapter seven hundred and beyond

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
about chapter seven hundred and beyond
so<00:01:43.950> maybe<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.030> too<00:01:45.090> far<00:01:45.509> ahead<00:01:45.659> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so maybe that's a bit too far ahead I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.630 
so maybe that's a bit too far ahead I
don't<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.649> down<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.829> road<00:01:47.100> due<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
don't want to go down that road due to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240 
don't want to go down that road due to
spoilers<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.659> i'm<00:01:49.110> sure<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.710> movie<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
spoilers but i'm sure this movie the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.870 
spoilers but i'm sure this movie the
last<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.880> between<00:01:51.450> 699<00:01:52.259> +<00:01:52.530> 700<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.250> i<00:01:53.520> don't

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
last is between 699 + 700 so i don't

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.130 
last is between 699 + 700 so i don't
think<00:01:54.060> they'd<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> far<00:01:54.720> ahead<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
think they'd go that far ahead with a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.810 
think they'd go that far ahead with a
new<00:01:55.259> generation<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.829> stuff<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.640> not

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
new generation and stuff it's not

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
new generation and stuff it's not
impossible<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.390> very<00:01:57.990> unlikely<00:01:58.380> anyway<00:01:58.890> what

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
impossible but very unlikely anyway what

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
impossible but very unlikely anyway what
do<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> guys<00:01:59.579> think<00:01:59.640> let<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.540> the
