00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hello everybody is so this is the

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.970 
hello everybody is so this is the
mechanism<00:00:04.170> video<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:06.410> magnet<00:00:07.410> no<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
mechanism video for the magnet no the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.650 
mechanism video for the magnet no the
revolver<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:09.240> made<00:00:09.960> recently<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> yeah

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
revolver I made recently and so yeah

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.390 
revolver I made recently and so yeah
this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.080> it's<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.860> pretty<00:00:14.190> simple

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this is it it's a pretty simple

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.269 
this is it it's a pretty simple
mechanism<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.560> so<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.949> here's<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
mechanism and so I just here's the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.090 
mechanism and so I just here's the
rubber<00:00:17.640> band<00:00:17.940> mechanism<00:00:18.770> for<00:00:20.420> trigger<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
rubber band mechanism for trigger so I

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.960 
rubber band mechanism for trigger so I
want<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:25.189> this<00:00:26.189> piece<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:28.970> I'm

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
want to do is use this piece here I'm

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
want to do is use this piece here I'm
sure<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> too<00:00:30.960> oh<00:00:31.199> here's<00:00:31.470> yeah

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
sure you can see it too oh here's yeah

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
sure you can see it too oh here's yeah
just<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.570> connects<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> way<00:00:33.960> down

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
just like that connects all the way down

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.229 
just like that connects all the way down
here<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> trigger

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
here and then it's just on the trigger

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
here and then it's just on the trigger
so<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.390> yeah<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> mechanism<00:00:40.640> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so I'm yeah for the mechanism the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.979 
so I'm yeah for the mechanism the
trigger<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.540> connected<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.879> yellow<00:00:44.989> L

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
trigger is connected to these yellow L

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.160 
trigger is connected to these yellow L
piece<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:48.320> sees<00:00:49.320> each<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
piece here and sees each got that and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.340 
piece here and sees each got that and
there's<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.829> piece<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.640> peg<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
there's this piece the peg right here so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
there's this piece the peg right here so
it<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.469> stops<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.270> going<00:00:57.270> any<00:00:57.570> further

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it just stops it from going any further

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.520 
it just stops it from going any further
and<00:00:58.800> should<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:03.000> part

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
and should and then you have this part

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.359 
and should and then you have this part
which<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> hammer<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:06.720> just

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
which is the hammer and it's just

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.140 
which is the hammer and it's just
connected<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.260> piece<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:10.729> here<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
connected to this piece right here and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
connected to this piece right here and
you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> goes<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.140> dinners<00:01:16.409> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you can see it goes up and dinners like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
you can see it goes up and dinners like
that<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:18.320> see<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:20.040> kind<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that and see that it's just kind of like

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.380 
that and see that it's just kind of like
this<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.740> L<00:01:23.670> piece<00:01:24.590> here<00:01:26.150> right<00:01:27.150> here

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this with this L piece here right here

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.780 
this with this L piece here right here
and<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:30.299> there's<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> gray<00:01:31.610> little<00:01:32.610> peg

band i use here and see ya and then on

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.840 
band i use here and see ya and then on
to<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.590> dial<00:01:43.590> apart<00:01:44.100> whatever<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to this the dial apart whatever it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.380 
to this the dial apart whatever it's
called<00:01:45.170> goes<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:47.189> which<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
called goes in to here which is the to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.950 
called goes in to here which is the to
buy<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> hole<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> i<00:01:51.780> just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
buy one with the hole in it and i just

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.630 
buy one with the hole in it and i just
have<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.200> taped<00:01:52.380> down<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.979> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> secures

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
have it taped down so it kind of secures

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.120 
have it taped down so it kind of secures
better<00:01:53.990> just<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:58.130> looks

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
better just put it in just like so looks

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.819 
better just put it in just like so looks
like<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.969> spin<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
like that and it spin and then you have

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.270 
like that and it spin and then you have
these<00:02:02.689> one<00:02:03.689> by<00:02:03.719> two<00:02:05.090> flats<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.039> on<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
these one by two flats here and on that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.690 
these one by two flats here and on that
just<00:02:08.580> makes<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.660> doesn't<00:02:09.690> fall<00:02:10.530> out

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
just makes it so it doesn't fall out

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.000 
just makes it so it doesn't fall out
and<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.160> there's<00:02:14.160> these<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:15.590> pegs<00:02:16.590> here

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and then so there's these two pegs here

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.390 
and then so there's these two pegs here
on<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.340> sides<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.400> connect

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
on the sides and then you just connect

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.900 
on the sides and then you just connect
the<00:02:20.459> trigger<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.060> mean<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.390> rubber<00:02:21.660> band<00:02:22.910> to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the trigger I mean that rubber band to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.600 
the trigger I mean that rubber band to
the<00:02:25.010> hammer<00:02:26.300> like<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:29.069> when<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.280> pull<00:02:29.519> it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the hammer like that so when you pull it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.650 
the hammer like that so when you pull it
back<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:32.190> happens<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.680> pull<00:02:34.680> trigger<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
back just happens that pull trigger and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.900 
back just happens that pull trigger and
then<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:38.069> put<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:39.080> rods<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:41.489> tons<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
then you put these rods I have tons of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.620 
then you put these rods I have tons of
them<00:02:42.090> six<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.519> then<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:44.760> put<00:02:45.530> one<00:02:46.530> into<00:02:46.769> these

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
them six and then you put one into these

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.490 
them six and then you put one into these
holes<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.540> spin<00:02:52.349> it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
holes just like that then you spin it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.569 
holes just like that then you spin it
until<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.579> top<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.750> and

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
until it's at the top just like that and

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.750 
until it's at the top just like that and
then<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:57.170> let<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.410> down<00:02:58.739> just<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.489> that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
then you let this down just like that
