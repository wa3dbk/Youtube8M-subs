drive all all the way to the airport and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
drive all all the way to the airport and
it<00:01:12.270> will<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.510> waiting<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.810> me<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.170> but

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it will be waiting for me there but

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
it will be waiting for me there but
there's<00:01:13.830> also<00:01:13.979> another<00:01:14.369> way<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
there's also another way to get into the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
there's also another way to get into the
blimp<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.650> fun<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> ways

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
blimp and it's a lot more fun of a ways

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.830 
blimp and it's a lot more fun of a ways
so<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:17.759> that's<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> do

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
so I think that's what we're going to do

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
so I think that's what we're going to do
today<00:01:19.159> basically<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.250> any<00:01:20.430> given<00:01:20.700> point

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
today basically at any given point

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.999 
today basically at any given point
there's<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> blimp<00:01:21.630> flying<00:01:22.020> around<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> GTA

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
there's a blimp flying around in the GTA

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.270 
there's a blimp flying around in the GTA
sky<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.500> land<00:01:25.979> on

that<00:01:29.400> will<00:01:29.490> give<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> stability<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.259> land

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that will give you the stability to land

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.370 
that will give you the stability to land
on<00:01:31.950> top<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.840> hijack

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
on top and then you can actually hijack

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
on top and then you can actually hijack
it<00:01:34.710> waltz<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> middle<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> sky<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it waltz in the middle of the sky and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.060 
it waltz in the middle of the sky and
that's<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.140> we're<00:01:37.229> gonna<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.560> today<00:01:37.740> cuz

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that's a lot more fun than just ordering

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960 
that's a lot more fun than just ordering
a<00:01:40.439> blimp<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.799> taking<00:01:41.250> off<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> ground

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
a blimp and taking off from the ground

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.999 
a blimp and taking off from the ground
that's<00:01:42.450> no<00:01:42.659> fun<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.049> all<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.350> give<00:01:43.500> me<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> second

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.060 

damn<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.170> game<00:01:55.410> is<00:01:55.470> nice<00:01:57.410> alright<00:01:58.410> guys<00:01:58.650> so

we're<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.370> open<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.760> helicopter<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:01.160> think

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
we're now open a helicopter and I think

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.980 
we're now open a helicopter and I think
I<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> blimp<00:02:02.940> off<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.330> distance<00:02:03.510> there

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I see a blimp off in the distance there

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.900 
I see a blimp off in the distance there
I<00:02:04.020> could<00:02:04.260> be<00:02:04.380> wrong<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.950> we're<00:02:05.730> going<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
I could be wrong but we're going to

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.719 
I could be wrong but we're going to
search<00:02:06.180> around<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.600> sky<00:02:06.870> for<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:08.130> blimp<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
search around the sky for the blimp that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
search around the sky for the blimp that
is<00:02:08.880> usually<00:02:09.210> flying<00:02:09.810> around<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.170> city<00:02:10.380> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is usually flying around the city and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
is usually flying around the city and
look<00:02:11.130> there<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.210> there<00:02:12.270> somehow<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
look there it is right there somehow I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.290 
look there it is right there somehow I
managed<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.410> miss<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> do

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
managed to miss it and all I have to do

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.920 
managed to miss it and all I have to do
is<00:02:15.570> literally<00:02:16.500> land<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.250> top<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
is literally land on top of it with the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.510 
is literally land on top of it with the
helicopter<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.490> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
helicopter and it's actually one of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.710 
helicopter and it's actually one of
those<00:02:20.730> things<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.030> are<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> little<00:02:21.630> bit

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
those things that are a little bit

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.380 
those things that are a little bit
easier<00:02:21.960> said<00:02:22.440> than<00:02:22.620> done<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.150> we're<00:02:24.300> gonna

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
easier said than done so we're gonna

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.020 
easier said than done so we're gonna
have<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> be<00:02:24.720> careful<00:02:25.350> because<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.700> blimp<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
have to be careful because the blimp is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.940 
have to be careful because the blimp is
continuously<00:02:27.660> moving<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
continuously moving so it's not the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.890 
continuously moving so it's not the
easiest<00:02:29.280> thing<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.790> my<00:02:30.270> controller<00:02:30.630> died

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
easiest thing and my controller died

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.780 
easiest thing and my controller died
it's<00:02:31.680> not<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> easiest<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.610> world

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's not the easiest thing in the world

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.360 
it's not the easiest thing in the world
to<00:02:32.940> land<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.270> top<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.440> think<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.070> can<00:02:35.190> get

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
to land on top of but I think we can get

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.080 
to land on top of but I think we can get
it<00:02:37.550> alright<00:02:38.610> careful

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.330 

steady<00:02:46.310> steady<00:02:47.720> there<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:48.989> go<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:50.160> get

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
steady steady there we go and just get

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.650 
steady steady there we go and just get
out<00:02:50.459> really<00:02:50.700> quickly<00:02:51.060> before<00:02:51.330> your

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
out really quickly before your

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.690 
out really quickly before your
helicopter<00:02:52.260> begins<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.680> slide<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.610> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
helicopter begins to slide and as you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.699 
helicopter begins to slide and as you
can<00:02:53.819> see<00:02:54.000> we<00:02:54.660> did<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> perfectly<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:55.680> I

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
can see we did it perfectly and all I

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.830 
can see we did it perfectly and all I
have<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.160> press<00:02:56.340> Y<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.569> starts

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
have to do is press Y and if it starts

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360 
have to do is press Y and if it starts
going<00:02:58.050> back<00:02:58.170> toward<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.500> helicopter<00:02:59.099> that's

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
going back toward the helicopter that's

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.520 
going back toward the helicopter that's
bad<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.239> press<00:03:00.540> Y<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.750> look<00:03:01.290> we're

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
bad but there press Y and look we're

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
bad but there press Y and look we're
enough<00:03:01.739> perk<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.099> blue<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.120> just<00:03:03.420> hijacked

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
enough perk in blue do we just hijacked

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.620 
enough perk in blue do we just hijacked
out<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> sky<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:05.940> lot<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.120> fun<00:03:06.390> to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
out of the sky so it's a lot of fun to

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.360 
out of the sky so it's a lot of fun to
get<00:03:07.050> into<00:03:07.319> one<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.500> these<00:03:07.590> things<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.220> then

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
get into one of these things and then

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.940 
get into one of these things and then
you<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.730> slowly<00:03:09.630> make<00:03:10.349> your<00:03:10.380> way<00:03:10.530> around<00:03:10.860> the
