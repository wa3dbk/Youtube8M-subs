00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it ever be possible if we could control

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.099

the<00:00:55.980> weather<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.270> already<00:00:57.660> knew<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the weather or if we already knew so I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
the weather or if we already knew so I
did<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.410> research<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> had<00:00:59.370> research

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
did some research well I had research

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
did some research well I had research
clone<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:00.390> research<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.870> find<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
clone do some research to find out and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
clone do some research to find out and
then<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.500> sent<00:01:01.710> him<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> alligator<00:01:02.309> pit<00:01:02.489> but

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
then I sent him to the alligator pit but

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
then I sent him to the alligator pit but
I<00:01:02.730> forgot<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> ask<00:01:03.270> him<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.600> he<00:01:03.719> found<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
now I then I did the research so it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.560 
now I then I did the research so it
turns<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.760> throughout<00:01:06.030> history<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.479> have

inconclusive more samples needed please

inconclusive more samples needed please
so<00:03:20.500> those<00:03:20.680> are<00:03:20.829> some<00:03:21.010> examples<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.489> ways<00:03:21.730> we

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
so those are some examples of ways we

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.039 
so those are some examples of ways we
attempted<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.359> control<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:22.780> weather<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
attempted to control the weather and

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.110 
attempted to control the weather and
maybe<00:03:23.769> succeed<00:03:24.310> it's<00:03:24.489> hard<00:03:24.639> to<00:03:24.730> prove<00:03:24.940> because

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
maybe succeed it's hard to prove because

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.729 
maybe succeed it's hard to prove because
you<00:03:25.359> can't<00:03:25.569> say<00:03:25.840> whether<00:03:26.049> or<00:03:26.169> not<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.620> would

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
you can't say whether or not it would

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.530 
you can't say whether or not it would
have<00:03:26.980> rained<00:03:27.220> anyway<00:03:27.639> had<00:03:27.819> you<00:03:27.940> not<00:03:28.090> salt<00:03:28.389> of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
have rained anyway had you not salt of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.270 
have rained anyway had you not salt of
the<00:03:28.629> clouds<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.620> only<00:03:29.769> way<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.950> find<00:03:30.129> out

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
the clouds you the only way to find out

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.740 
the clouds you the only way to find out
is<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.549> have<00:03:30.639> a<00:03:30.669> time<00:03:30.879> machine<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.389> no<00:03:31.569> one

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
is if you have a time machine and no one

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.809 
is if you have a time machine and no one
has<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.139> of<00:03:32.230> those<00:03:32.319> except<00:03:32.919> me<00:03:33.069> and<00:03:33.549> I'm<00:03:33.669> not

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
has one of those except me and I'm not

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.280 
has one of those except me and I'm not
gonna<00:03:33.970> let<00:03:34.180> anyone<00:03:34.329> use<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.690> because<00:03:35.109> it's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
gonna let anyone use it because it's

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.349 
gonna let anyone use it because it's
mine<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:36.400> some<00:03:36.579> scientists<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.150> some

that's<00:03:42.160> sure<00:03:42.370> crazy<00:03:42.669> one<00:03:42.940> way<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.150> prevent

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
that's sure crazy one way to prevent

should<00:04:30.139> try<00:04:30.500> things<00:04:30.800> but<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.310> course<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:32.120> just

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
should try things but of course not just

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.689 
should try things but of course not just
large-scale<00:04:33.020> immediately<00:04:33.650> with<00:04:34.280> lots<00:04:34.520> and

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
large-scale immediately with lots and

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.010 
large-scale immediately with lots and
lots<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.970> testing<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.419> know<00:04:35.509> we<00:04:35.630> stupid<00:04:35.870> about

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
lots of testing you know we stupid about

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.180 
lots of testing you know we stupid about
it<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.229> make<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.380> lot<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.620> clones<00:04:36.860> but<00:04:37.070> do<00:04:37.130> you

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
it I make a lot of clones but do you

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.050 
it I make a lot of clones but do you
think<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.430> just<00:04:37.639> went

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
think I just went

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.180 
think I just went
clone<00:04:38.660> clone<00:04:38.690> right<00:04:39.229> away<00:04:39.440> no<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.680> did<00:04:39.949> a<00:04:39.979> lot<00:04:40.160> of

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
clone clone right away no I did a lot of

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.890 
clone clone right away no I did a lot of
testing<00:04:40.580> first<00:04:40.729> well<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.000> made<00:04:41.330> testing<00:04:41.690> clone

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
testing first well I made testing clone

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.510 
testing first well I made testing clone
do<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.110> testing<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.650> was<00:04:42.740> really<00:04:43.370> busy

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
do the testing because I was really busy

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.310 
do the testing because I was really busy
that<00:04:43.639> day<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.330> accidentally<00:04:44.780> made<00:04:44.960> pesky

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
that day but accidentally made pesky

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.550 
that day but accidentally made pesky
clone<00:04:45.560> he<00:04:46.550> was<00:04:46.669> really<00:04:46.940> angry<00:04:47.120> about<00:04:47.560> his

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
clone he was really angry about his

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.529 
clone he was really angry about his
extra<00:04:48.830> body<00:04:49.009> parts<00:04:49.100> anyway<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.030> question<00:04:50.419> I

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
extra body parts anyway the question I

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.600 
extra body parts anyway the question I
was<00:04:50.630> asking<00:04:50.960> was<00:04:51.139> will<00:04:51.350> we<00:04:51.530> ever<00:04:51.740> be<00:04:52.130> able<00:04:52.460> to

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
was asking was will we ever be able to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.409 
was asking was will we ever be able to
control<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.150> weather

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
control the weather

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.240 
control the weather
we<00:04:53.539> are<00:04:53.720> already<00:04:54.139> able<00:04:54.289> to<00:04:54.470> control<00:04:54.740> aspects

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
we are already able to control aspects

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.590 
we are already able to control aspects
of<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.490> weather<00:04:55.639> will<00:04:55.820> we<00:04:55.970> ever<00:04:56.060> control<00:04:56.479> it

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
of the weather will we ever control it

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.870 
of the weather will we ever control it
all<00:04:56.870> like<00:04:57.530> with<00:04:57.949> precision<00:04:58.669> and

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
all like with precision and

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.300 
all like with precision and
predictability<00:04:59.419> I<00:04:59.840> just<00:05:00.830> got<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.070> think<00:05:01.190> it's

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
predictability I just got to think it's

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.890 
predictability I just got to think it's
possible<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.210> know<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.449> got<00:05:02.539> all<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.750> stuff

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
possible you know you got all that stuff

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.300 
possible you know you got all that stuff
moving<00:05:03.289> around<00:05:03.500> up<00:05:03.710> there<00:05:03.740> in<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.100> sky

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
moving around up there in the sky

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.760 
moving around up there in the sky
changing<00:05:04.940> form<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.510> temperature<00:05:06.020> that's<00:05:06.590> all

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
changing form and temperature that's all

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.300 
changing form and temperature that's all
matter

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
matter

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.980 
matter
we<00:05:07.370> humans<00:05:07.520> manipulate<00:05:08.120> matter<00:05:08.330> all<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.720> time

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
we humans manipulate matter all the time

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.450 
we humans manipulate matter all the time
it's<00:05:09.410> one<00:05:09.530> of<00:05:09.590> my<00:05:09.650> favorite<00:05:09.979> things<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.280> do

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
it's one of my favorite things to do

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.500 
it's one of my favorite things to do
check<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:10.940> out<00:05:15.820> maybe<00:05:16.820> eventually<00:05:17.150> as

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
check it out maybe eventually as

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.390 
check it out maybe eventually as
technology<00:05:18.080> progresses<00:05:18.500> I'm<00:05:18.889> thinking<00:05:19.250> like

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
technology progresses I'm thinking like

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.339 
technology progresses I'm thinking like
a<00:05:19.460> top<00:05:20.090> thousand<00:05:20.570> two<00:05:20.690> thousand<00:05:21.110> years<00:05:21.260> from

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
a top thousand two thousand years from

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.500 
a top thousand two thousand years from
now<00:05:21.560> not<00:05:22.250> your<00:05:22.430> grandfather's<00:05:22.970> technology

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
now not your grandfather's technology

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.089 
now not your grandfather's technology
something<00:05:23.810> far<00:05:24.020> beyond<00:05:24.289> our<00:05:24.440> understanding

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
something far beyond our understanding

something far beyond our understanding
you<00:05:25.250> could<00:05:25.430> conceive<00:05:26.090> of<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.840> know<00:05:26.960> machines

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
you could conceive of you know machines

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.200 
you could conceive of you know machines
that<00:05:27.680> could<00:05:27.830> control<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.669> stuff<00:05:28.880> up<00:05:29.030> there

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
that could control the stuff up there

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.339 
that could control the stuff up there
but<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.449> point<00:05:29.599> at<00:05:29.750> which<00:05:29.810> we<00:05:29.960> can<00:05:30.050> control

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
but the point at which we can control

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.420 
but the point at which we can control
whether<00:05:30.620> with<00:05:30.830> precision

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
whether with precision

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.000 
whether with precision
unless<00:05:31.699> you're<00:05:31.849> Highlander<00:05:32.650> we<00:05:33.650> won't<00:05:33.860> be

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
unless you're Highlander we won't be

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.980 
unless you're Highlander we won't be
alive<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.550> guess<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.150> mortal<00:05:35.510> clone<00:05:35.720> will<00:05:35.870> be

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
alive I guess a mortal clone will be

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.839 
alive I guess a mortal clone will be
alive<00:05:36.169> right<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.380> mortal<00:05:36.650> clone<00:05:36.830> yep<00:05:37.400> great

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
alive right a mortal clone yep great

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.640 
alive right a mortal clone yep great

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
time machine I could just go to the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.589 
time machine I could just go to the
future<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:43.639> see<00:05:43.820> if<00:05:43.909> we<00:05:44.000> can<00:05:44.120> control<00:05:44.539> the

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
future and see if we can control the

future and see if we can control the
weather

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
weather

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.219
