connect<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.550> everything<00:04:06.940> but<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.570> really<00:04:07.750> do

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
connect and everything but I really do

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.570 
connect and everything but I really do
want<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.350> upgrade<00:04:08.500> because<00:04:08.830> these<00:04:09.100> monitors

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
want to upgrade because these monitors

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.400 
want to upgrade because these monitors
aren't<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:09.880> good<00:04:10.060> for<00:04:10.270> video<00:04:10.510> editing<00:04:10.630> so

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
aren't that good for video editing so

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.140 
aren't that good for video editing so
I'm<00:04:11.530> kind<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:11.860> interested<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.550> picking<00:04:12.760> up<00:04:12.940> a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
I'm kind of interested in picking up a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.229 
I'm kind of interested in picking up a
27-inch<00:04:14.100> 1440p<00:04:15.100> monitor<00:04:15.610> or<00:04:15.820> something<00:04:16.120> like

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
27-inch 1440p monitor or something like

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.130 
27-inch 1440p monitor or something like
that<00:04:16.830> kind<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:18.010> higher<00:04:18.220> upgrade<00:04:18.960> for<00:04:19.960> that

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
that kind of a higher upgrade for that

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.970 
that kind of a higher upgrade for that
and<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:21.489> dual<00:04:21.700> monitors<00:04:22.150> displays<00:04:22.780> work<00:04:23.410> okay

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
and the dual monitors displays work okay

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.160 
and the dual monitors displays work okay
with<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> macbook<00:04:24.610> pro<00:04:24.640> it's<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.180> great<00:04:26.140> but

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
with the macbook pro it's not great but

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.140 
with the macbook pro it's not great but
there<00:04:26.650> are<00:04:26.680> some<00:04:27.100> problems<00:04:27.220> once<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.970> while

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
there are some problems once in a while

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.510 
there are some problems once in a while
so<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.230> part<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.620> handheld<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:30.340> let<00:04:30.460> me

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so this part is a handheld so let me

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.460 
so this part is a handheld so let me
show<00:04:30.640> you<00:04:30.670> what's<00:04:30.970> under<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.510> monitor<00:04:32.050> stand

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
show you what's under the monitor stand

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.980 
show you what's under the monitor stand
here's<00:04:33.460> my<00:04:33.610> macbook<00:04:34.030> pro<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.600> everything

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
here's my macbook pro and everything

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.540 
here's my macbook pro and everything
less<00:04:35.140> connected<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:35.890> a<00:04:36.070> huge<00:04:36.250> mess

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
less connected to it's just a huge mess

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.510 
less connected to it's just a huge mess
down<00:04:36.790> there<00:04:37.080> i'll<00:04:38.080> show<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.740> specs<00:04:39.280> right

down there i'll show you the specs right

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.580 
down there i'll show you the specs right
now<00:04:39.730> it's<00:04:40.300> kind<00:04:40.420> of<00:04:40.630> upgrade<00:04:41.080> as<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.350> as<00:04:41.440> much

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
now it's kind of upgrade as to as much

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.400 
now it's kind of upgrade as to as much
as<00:04:41.800> i<00:04:41.890> can<00:04:41.950> there's<00:04:42.550> two<00:04:43.510> hard<00:04:43.780> drives<00:04:43.960> one<00:04:44.260> an

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
as i can there's two hard drives one an

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.400 
as i can there's two hard drives one an
SSD<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:44.950> wasn't<00:04:45.580> one<00:04:45.790> is<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.200> regular<00:04:47.200> hard

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
SSD and wasn't one is a regular hard

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.700 
SSD and wasn't one is a regular hard
drive<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.950> then<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.730> has<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.000> 2.9<00:04:49.690> meters<00:04:49.930> intel

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
drive and then it has a 2.9 meters intel

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.250 
drive and then it has a 2.9 meters intel
core<00:04:50.950> i7<00:04:51.070> as<00:04:51.640> well<00:04:52.150> as<00:04:52.210> 16<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.690> bytes<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:53.050> ram

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
core i7 as well as 16 you bytes of ram

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.010 
core i7 as well as 16 you bytes of ram
so<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.620> pretty<00:04:53.830> much<00:04:54.010> maxed<00:04:54.250> out<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:55.360> it's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
so it's pretty much maxed out but it's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.320 
so it's pretty much maxed out but it's
okay<00:04:56.470> for<00:04:56.530> video<00:04:56.950> editing<00:04:57.070> now<00:04:57.430> because<00:04:57.910> i<00:04:58.090> I

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
okay for video editing now because i I

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.510 
okay for video editing now because i I
do<00:04:58.510> do<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> lot<00:04:59.050> more<00:04:59.229> than<00:04:59.410> just<00:04:59.590> video<00:05:00.070> editing

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
do do a lot more than just video editing

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.050 
do do a lot more than just video editing
now

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
now

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.750 
now
and<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.600> do<00:05:01.660> plan<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.110> upgrading<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.980> imac

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
and I do plan on upgrading to a imac

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.390 
and I do plan on upgrading to a imac
27-inch<00:05:04.480> or<00:05:04.750> maybe<00:05:05.020> even<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.380> mac<00:05:05.560> pro<00:05:05.830> baseline

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
27-inch or maybe even a mac pro baseline

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.820 
27-inch or maybe even a mac pro baseline
I'm<00:05:06.880> just<00:05:07.210> not<00:05:07.270> very<00:05:07.419> sure<00:05:07.720> yet<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.169> mean<00:05:08.410> I'm

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
I'm just not very sure yet I mean I'm

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.260 
I'm just not very sure yet I mean I'm
going<00:05:08.919> to<00:05:09.040> be<00:05:09.130> moving<00:05:09.310> soon<00:05:09.669> to<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.910> new<00:05:10.090> house

and everything then but under that next
to<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.370> my<00:05:15.550> audio<00:05:16.000> interface<00:05:16.450> which<00:05:16.690> is<00:05:16.810> a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
to it is my audio interface which is a

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.780 
to it is my audio interface which is a
focus<00:05:17.230> right<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.590> I<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.770> for<00:05:18.220> my<00:05:18.310> blue<00:05:18.520> spark

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790
