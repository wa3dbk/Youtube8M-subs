00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.340
 97 2015 a date not to be forgotten e 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.640
 great desire for all the boys are 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.369
 mister white and welcome to this video 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.909
 today really a phenomenal thing 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.399
 something that really explodes walls 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:27.859
 yes because we have the chance we have 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.309
 I was lucky enough to be able to watch the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.640
 black zombie mode trailer 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.710
 ops 3 call of duty in preview we have 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 therefore had the opportunity to create a 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.359
 video analysis about it as you well know 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.070
 the zombie mode is presented in 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.469
 these hours at the comic con di san diego 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.329
 seems to have introduced so many 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.100
 lots of news we try to 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.050
 analyze them one by one 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.629
 first of all we are in the Chicago of the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.460
 20 years 30 the twenties and thirties 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.079
 should already do to return to 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.449
 mind something that belongs to 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.010
 old zombie stories but let's not get lost 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.589
 in chatter and go ahead yes 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.619
 because from the music swing in the background 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.600
 in general it looks like from the atmosphere 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.750
 that something has changed the effect that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.939
 this is different from this thriller 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.100
 effect is confirmed continuing 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.990
 in the vision of the trailer from 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.790
 presence of four new characters a 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.640
 adapter of a dancer boxing 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.759
 burlesque a knife thrower or a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.439
 magician and an investigator these 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.079
 characters are also marked 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.170
 from particular weapons 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.360
 special weapons features a 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.250
 brass knuckles for the scissors wrestler 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.500
 for the throwing knife dancer 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.539
 for the magician or knife thrower ed 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.310
 finally a revolver for the detective 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.420
 let's move on to the old ones 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.210
 zombie maps 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.170
 yes because it is present at minute 0 15 a 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.969
 bus 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.939
 the reference is clear and seems 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.850
 bring us back to the first map of transit 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.579
 black ops 2 zombies from the second 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.400
 0 30 words are spoken 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.250
 very important 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:14.530
 I translate and I quote I know who you are I 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:17.470
 seen each one of you this sentence looks like 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.450
 very very simple but it already implies one 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.840
 very important thing we have here too 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.630
 a fifth character hidden a little 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.720
 as was maxis in old videos 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.060
 yes because we have a narrative voice that 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 he knows our characters and indeed 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.680
 while these words are spoken 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.050
 kinematics are shown in which 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.200
 each character kills another 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.930
 person the fifth in question then 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.959
 he knows these people intimately and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.450
 above all he knows what they are made of 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.190
 the belly pack is presented on 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.050
 minute 0 43 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.470
 obviously this is possible from the fact 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.150
 that we find a modified weapon then 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.240
 the same second is not seen 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.160
 materially the pack up even at 0 48 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.130
 we can see a tea of ​​beer there 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.980
 indicates a presence of a mystery 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.290
 very important box the presence of a 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.700
 candy vending machine not 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.130
 we still know if this machine 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.070
 will replace the old and soft drinks thing 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.680
 very unlikely or if it will be one 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.420
 sort of temporary bonus that indeed 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.190
 we see several times in the video 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.870
 also marry in other parts 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.480
 by the way from the candy machine 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.360
 we see that one is distributed 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.760
 all candy-like effect 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.620
 zombie blood our characters 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.600
 when they eat this kind of candy 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.650
 in fact they will be immune to zombies for 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.680
 a limited time 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.930
 the distributor appears at the second 0 53 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.390
 per minute 10 6 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.570
 the presence of three is very important 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.959
 swords three swords I remember so much i 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.730
 sticks of origins the last map 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.799
 final the epilogue of the zombie saga 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.650
 known so far about black ops 2 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.840
 in fact we have three swords one that looks like 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.740
 be connected to fire an ice 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.870
 and an electro 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.060
 they can also be highlighted at the level of 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040
 trailer an enhanced shield that will have 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.740
 rockets to make the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.200
 character a time 100 a revolver and a 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.190
 sniper rifle is reconfirmed 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.310
 all the bonuses 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.680
 in fact we will have the basic ammunition 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.400
 the bomb that is shown 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.830
 at the 122 and 053 minutes respectively 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.520
 as always the weapons will be purchasable 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.570
 from the ropeway 23 you see the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.480
 confirms a very important thing is the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.340
 presence of a power that 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.650
 probably through use 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.390
 of candies will always come out of 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.120
 these tentacles try what they will be 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.070
 very useful to distance and knock down 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.110
 the zombies that will appear before you 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.340
 a sort of is also highlighted 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.080
 mini mini boss 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.280
 a bit like it was in the previous days 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.000
 a zoom of fire the skis give short 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.370
 There are 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.770
 there are not only zombies in fact we notice 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.190
 a minibus at mood 143 or one 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.650
 three-headed creature that probably 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.150
 will be an equivalent of old dogs like 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.420
 we have seen several times in the old ones 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.610
 maps starting from a chino dar totem 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.260
 this is only a small analysis e 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.600
 what we could see in one 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.850
 very short analysis of the trailer 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.010
