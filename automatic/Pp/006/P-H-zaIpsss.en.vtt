really think you can maybe they added it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.019 
really think you can maybe they added it
with<00:00:27.830> reducing<00:00:28.830> way<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.550> know<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> whole

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
with reducing way you know that whole

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.700 
with reducing way you know that whole
quickscoping<00:00:30.630> thing<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.470> stuff

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
quickscoping thing so you can do stuff

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.810 
quickscoping thing so you can do stuff
like<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.570> barrel<00:00:33.570> stuff<00:00:33.809> people<00:00:34.820> but

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
like that and barrel stuff people but

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.869 
like that and barrel stuff people but
yeah<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.260> pretty<00:00:37.410> cool<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.070> what

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
yeah I think it's pretty cool so what
we're<00:00:39.059> testing<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:39.690> we've<00:00:40.320> only<00:00:40.530> done
