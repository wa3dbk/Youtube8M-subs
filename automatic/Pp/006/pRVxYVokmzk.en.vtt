00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
there so all the cooling devices and so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
there so all the cooling devices and so
forth<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> wouldn't<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> big<00:01:53.310> deal<00:01:53.490> to

get<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.500> running<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.729> Bobcat<00:01:57.000> also

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
get that up and running this Bobcat also

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
get that up and running this Bobcat also
is<00:01:57.840> equipped<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.590> Bobcat<00:01:59.159> security
