00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.590
 levy apply a little more 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 notice how it is taking the shades deepening 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.609
 despite having a little more down here while it is drying 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.440
 I know what happens is that this is a material that dries very quickly 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.569
 DC 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.699
 quickly adheres to paper 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.390
 and if it does not fast blur 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.140
 after getting stained 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 if you are going to have to handle the brush a little fast 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790
 lesjak council 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 to go gradually 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.040
 they prepare the 1st a very good first tonality to little they are doing for 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.600
 overlay as we do with 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 the part 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.960
 the graphite 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 darkening 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.050
 let's apply a little shadow 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 the midwife musculature 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.580
 and the extremes 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.530
 to decide 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.580
 with this part should be glass 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.250
 again 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.110
 I think I have 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.440
 I put myself advocated pure 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.510
 I have in a container 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
 common or mambazo can be made of plastic 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 that can be easily 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 I try to be by sections learning to respect 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.250
 justly 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 the terminations can access m 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 in the face 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.639
 I'm going to give it a little more strength 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.339
 quickly 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.339
 Down here 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.099
 I saw carry 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.249
 with pure water 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.179
 the same of being a little more 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.179
 What I'm going to do now is with a much finer brush 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.689
 that can be a 3 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.089
 continue to apply l 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.089
 as shadow the fingers 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.899
 they pass 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.899
 drying it with absorbent paper 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 I do not know if I should but it's okay 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.579
 stop highlighting the part of the fingers 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.599
 and logically 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.019
 they will be watching and studying the musculature of the moma to be here below in 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.299
 the part 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 By the neck 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.469
 in the head 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.899
 in the ear 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.899
 here should be 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 little more water to blur a little more 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.569
 they left allusion analysis 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.889
 what I'm going to do now 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.999
 with a little 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.419
 blue china ink 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.759
 prepared 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.759
 only one drop 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.359
 nathan elliot blue 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.319
 for the letter so arid more 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.769
 at the same time you can trust 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.019
 logically d the helmet we could do it 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.949
 little by his side 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.499
 little metallic 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.499
 to prepare blue with a little water 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.229
 the brushes is good that when I assumed use another color do not square 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.229
 with detergent 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.389
 so that the impiva looks good 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.150
 he said some clear 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
 I'm going deeper 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.569
 dry 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 and also do little to the sword 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.199
 it will give you a little bit 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.199
 more watery 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.990
 I know I have a pure red here 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:40.039
 and could paint for another part of the bracelet he has in his hand 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.159
 and exhibit culminating this work 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.860
 edict 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.860
 one 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.349
 one 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.509
 I will be back 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.509
 he has nine 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.710
 as well 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.610
 the purpose of this program 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.740
 but those who have understood a little about the technique of water 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.009
 logically that this takes a lot of practice experimentation 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.729
 combination of colors and good deepening in the water is a bit 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.630
 complicated when we have needed just after placing him 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.219
 as I explained 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.869
 the material in cigars in five local water to give you the completions or 

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.949
 they can also remark it logically 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.099
 you know if they want to specialize drawing school gourd can find 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.060
 all the data in our short advertising or also here in soria not 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:15.059
 they are companies that pass logically when I'm talking 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.099
 I hope I gave you this program we will find you next 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:21.680
 week with a new program 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.120
 logically with a car
