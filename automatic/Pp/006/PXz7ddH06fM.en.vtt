from them I decided to make a video
about<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.680> 5000<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.699> quite<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> lot<00:00:18.270> he<00:00:19.170> did

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
about that so 5000 is quite a lot he did

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.859 
about that so 5000 is quite a lot he did
manage<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> get<00:00:19.890> 1/3<00:00:20.340> each<00:00:20.550> piece<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
manage to get 1/3 each piece which was a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.590 
manage to get 1/3 each piece which was a
mage<00:00:22.109> stop<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> he<00:00:23.609> also<00:00:23.760> managed<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
mage stop and he also managed to get to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.599 
mage stop and he also managed to get to
a<00:00:24.630> llama<00:00:24.840> dragon<00:00:25.289> masks<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.189> didn't<00:00:26.490> know

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
a llama dragon masks which I didn't know

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.970 
a llama dragon masks which I didn't know
that<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:26.970> were<00:00:27.119> data<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.230> only<00:00:28.650> two

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
that they were data there but only two

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.460 
that they were data there but only two
so<00:00:29.580> potentially<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.480> could<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.869> sharing<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so potentially they could be sharing the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.920 
so potentially they could be sharing the
same<00:00:31.650> droplet<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.520> herd<00:00:32.880> age<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.420> maybe

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
same droplet with herd age or maybe

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.560 
same droplet with herd age or maybe

sigh bees now obviously a lot of items
that<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> drop<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.520> price<00:00:59.760> because

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that are going to drop in price because

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
that are going to drop in price because
they<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.449> fairly<00:01:00.719> new<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> most<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.770> them<00:01:01.920> are

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
they are fairly new and most of them are

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640 
they are fairly new and most of them are
cosmetic<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.059> usually<00:01:03.780> people<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.379> really

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
cosmetic and usually people don't really

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
cosmetic and usually people don't really
care<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.070> cosmetics<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:05.939> want<00:01:06.150> stats

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
care about cosmetics they want stats

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.280 
care about cosmetics they want stats
like<00:01:06.930> Ranger<00:01:07.619> boots<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.340> Robin<00:01:09.150> Hood<00:01:09.330> hat<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
like Ranger boots and Robin Hood hat so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
like Ranger boots and Robin Hood hat so
they're<00:01:10.650> gonna<00:01:10.830> drop<00:01:11.070> eventually<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.939> what

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they're gonna drop eventually so what

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.060 
they're gonna drop eventually so what
I'm<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.420> say<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.689> now<00:01:13.080> probably<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
I'm gonna say right now probably in a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
I'm gonna say right now probably in a
month<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.520> gonna<00:01:14.640> change<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:15.420> quite<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> lot

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
month it's gonna change by quite a lot

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
month it's gonna change by quite a lot
but<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> total<00:01:16.770> value<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.700> items

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
but the total value of all these items

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.380 
but the total value of all these items
is<00:01:18.420> close<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.990> three<00:01:19.290> billion<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.180> on<00:01:21.180> average

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
is close to three billion and on average

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
is close to three billion and on average
from<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.140> close<00:01:22.439> girl<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> should<00:01:23.130> get

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
from one close girl you should get

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.020 
from one close girl you should get
approximately<00:01:24.229> close<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.610> 600,000<00:01:26.610> per<00:01:26.729> clue

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
approximately close to 600,000 per clue

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.080 
approximately close to 600,000 per clue
so<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> worth<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:29.100> farming<00:01:29.909> those

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so is it worth actually farming those

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.819 
so is it worth actually farming those
clothes<00:01:30.450> clothes<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.350> doing<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
clothes clothes because I was doing that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.770 
clothes clothes because I was doing that
because<00:01:32.040> they<00:01:32.520> were<00:01:32.670> fairly<00:01:32.970> new<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
because they were fairly new but now I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
because they were fairly new but now I
don't<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:35.280> worth<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:35.970> not

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
don't think it's it's worth it I'm not

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
don't think it's it's worth it I'm not
trying<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.659> say<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> should<00:01:37.350> not

complete a lid close clothes because

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
complete a lid close clothes because
they<00:01:39.540> give<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.869> junk<00:01:40.530> loot<00:01:40.829> compared<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> how

they give like junk loot compared to how

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.789 
they give like junk loot compared to how
much<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.689> invest<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.500> one

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
much time you have to invest to get one

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
much time you have to invest to get one
I'm<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.549> saying<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.060> shouldn't<00:01:45.360> kill

monsters<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> sake<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> getting<00:01:47.670> close

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
monsters for the sake of getting close

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670
