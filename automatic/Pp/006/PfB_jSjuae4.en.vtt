00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
able to take her immediately under

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.670 
able to take her immediately under
anesthesia<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:04.120> get<00:04:04.330> imaging<00:04:04.870> done<00:04:05.020> both<00:04:05.290> MRI

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
anesthesia to get imaging done both MRI

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.699 
anesthesia to get imaging done both MRI
and<00:04:05.920> CT<00:04:06.510> which<00:04:07.510> was<00:04:07.630> fantastic<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:08.170> us<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.650> we

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
it'd just be routine because she's been

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.180 
it'd just be routine because she's been
healthy<00:04:40.840> she<00:04:41.440> hasn't<00:04:41.560> been<00:04:41.710> showing<00:04:41.919> any

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
signs of pain or anything and that's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.010 
signs of pain or anything and that's
