option<00:03:46.210> you<00:03:46.300> can<00:03:46.450> buffer<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.080> it's<00:03:47.590> easy<00:03:47.740> to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
option you can buffer that it's easy to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.660 
option you can buffer that it's easy to
get<00:03:47.950> away<00:03:48.070> from<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.850> pressure<00:03:49.090> sure<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.780> should
