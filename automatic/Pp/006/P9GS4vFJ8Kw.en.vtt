00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.750 
noticing this that that's quite unique
and<00:00:29.350> and<00:00:29.590> that's<00:00:29.800> actually<00:00:30.220> what<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:30.400> noticed

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
and and that's actually what I noticed

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.840 
and and that's actually what I noticed
about<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:31.090> first<00:00:31.270> -<00:00:31.539> now<00:00:32.410> I<00:00:32.830> did<00:00:33.190> modify<00:00:33.520> this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
about it first - now I did modify this

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.580 
about it first - now I did modify this
somewhat<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.570> so<00:00:34.989> I'll<00:00:35.140> point<00:00:35.350> that<00:00:35.470> out

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
somewhat and so I'll point that out

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.860 
somewhat and so I'll point that out
right<00:00:35.860> away<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.550> that<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.150> these<00:00:37.390> zippers

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
right away and that is these zippers

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.299 
right away and that is these zippers
here<00:00:38.500> have<00:00:39.250> these<00:00:39.640> had<00:00:40.150> these<00:00:40.330> huge<00:00:41.309> metal

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
here have these had these huge metal

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.610 
here have these had these huge metal
tabs<00:00:42.790> that<00:00:43.059> you<00:00:43.449> know<00:00:43.629> zippers<00:00:43.989> come<00:00:44.199> with<00:00:44.379> and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
tabs that you know zippers come with and

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.740 
tabs that you know zippers come with and
they<00:00:45.190> would<00:00:45.400> clink<00:00:45.670> around<00:00:46.000> on<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.360> I<00:00:46.479> really

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
they would clink around on it I really

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.200 
they would clink around on it I really
didn't<00:00:46.930> like<00:00:47.050> that<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.489> what<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.790> did<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:49.120> I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
didn't like that and so what I did is I

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.210 
didn't like that and so what I did is I
just<00:00:49.239> took<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.809> pair<00:00:50.290> of<00:00:50.320> pliers<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.890> clipped

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
just took a pair of pliers and I clipped

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.910 
just took a pair of pliers and I clipped
those<00:00:51.430> off<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.879> I<00:00:51.970> moved<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.589> zipper<00:00:53.589> pulls

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
those off and I moved the zipper pulls

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.520 
those off and I moved the zipper pulls
directly<00:00:54.370> onto<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.089> zippers<00:00:55.479> and<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:56.320> seems

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
directly onto the zippers and it seems

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.549 
directly onto the zippers and it seems
to<00:00:56.680> work<00:00:56.710> just<00:00:56.860> fine<00:00:58.140> currently<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.320> thing

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
to work just fine currently this thing

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.039 
to work just fine currently this thing
comes<00:00:59.769> in<00:00:59.920> black<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.190> coyote

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
comes in black and coyote

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.049 
comes in black and coyote
so<00:01:02.049> I'm<00:01:02.769> not<00:01:02.920> sure<00:01:02.979> exactly<00:01:03.220> what<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.850> purpose

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
so I'm not sure exactly what the purpose

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.750 
so I'm not sure exactly what the purpose
of<00:01:04.390> having<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.870> two<00:01:05.049> zips<00:01:05.320> are<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.799> like<00:01:06.520> it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
of having the two zips are I like it

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.649 
of having the two zips are I like it
though<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.210> it's<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:09.880> unzip<00:01:10.210> it

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
though because it's you can unzip it

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.870 
though because it's you can unzip it
this<00:01:10.810> much<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:11.500> get<00:01:11.680> all<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.340> cold<00:01:12.700> air

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
this much and you get all this cold air

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.060 
this much and you get all this cold air
coming<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.540> it's<00:01:14.290> kind<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.650> like<00:01:14.830> being

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
coming in so it's kind of like being

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.860 
coming in so it's kind of like being
able<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.370> take<00:01:15.610> half<00:01:15.880> your<00:01:16.090> layer<00:01:16.300> off<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:16.780> if

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
able to take half your layer off so if

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.480 
able to take half your layer off so if
you're<00:01:17.020> skiing<00:01:17.290> or<00:01:17.590> running<00:01:18.190> or<00:01:18.340> doing

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
you're skiing or running or doing

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.430 
you're skiing or running or doing
something<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.570> can<00:01:19.720> let<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:19.900> lot<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.140> cold

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
something and you can let a lot of cold

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.740 
something and you can let a lot of cold
air<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.650> here<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.220> start<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.030> cool<00:01:22.210> off<00:01:22.420> and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
air in here and start to cool off and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.270 
air in here and start to cool off and
then<00:01:22.990> when<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.230> get<00:01:23.320> cold<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:23.830> as<00:01:23.950> easy<00:01:24.100> as

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
then when you get cold it's as easy as

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.790 
then when you get cold it's as easy as
just<00:01:24.450> zipping<00:01:25.450> those<00:01:25.750> two<00:01:25.990> up<00:01:26.170> again<00:01:26.470> and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
just zipping those two up again and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.630 
just zipping those two up again and
that's<00:01:27.790> really<00:01:28.150> nice<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.600> gives<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:28.900> much

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that's really nice it gives you a much

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.910 
that's really nice it gives you a much
larger<00:01:30.640> area<00:01:31.000> that's<00:01:31.270> open<00:01:31.420> now<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.410> think<00:01:32.770> they

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
larger area that's open now I think they

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
larger area that's open now I think they
say<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:34.090> is<00:01:34.360> reminiscent<00:01:34.870> of<00:01:35.230> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
say that the this is reminiscent of a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.380 
say that the this is reminiscent of a
scuba<00:01:37.780> gear<00:01:37.960> or<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.440> wetsuit<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.280> that's<00:01:39.760> I'm

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
scuba gear or a wetsuit and that's I'm

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.910 
scuba gear or a wetsuit and that's I'm
not<00:01:40.600> sure<00:01:40.750> exactly<00:01:40.930> why<00:01:41.200> they<00:01:41.350> choose<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.800> do

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
not sure exactly why they choose to do

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.550 
not sure exactly why they choose to do
that<00:01:42.570> chose<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.600> do<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.930> maybe<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.260> was<00:01:44.350> just

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
that chose to do that maybe it was just

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.840 
that chose to do that maybe it was just
the<00:01:44.650> way<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:45.010> looked<00:01:45.190> maybe<00:01:45.550> they<00:01:45.640> liked

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
the way that it looked maybe they liked

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.470 
the way that it looked maybe they liked
it<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:47.410> one<00:01:47.590> thing<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.920> wasn't<00:01:48.330> expecting<00:01:49.330> when

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
it the one thing I wasn't expecting when

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.540 
it the one thing I wasn't expecting when
I<00:01:49.510> got<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:50.800> actually<00:01:51.190> don't

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
I got this and that I actually don't

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.060 
I got this and that I actually don't
like<00:01:51.700> at<00:01:51.970> all<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.720> there's<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.110> band<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.830> elastic

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
like at all is there's a band of elastic

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.740 
like at all is there's a band of elastic
that<00:01:54.520> goes<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.909> way<00:01:55.060> around<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.540> bottom

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
that goes all the way around the bottom

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
that goes all the way around the bottom

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and I hate that in jackets because it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.040 
and I hate that in jackets because it
tends<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.159> want<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.490> ride<00:02:00.670> up<00:02:00.750> especially<00:02:01.750> when

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
tends to want to ride up especially when

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.690 
tends to want to ride up especially when
you<00:02:02.110> bend<00:02:02.320> over<00:02:02.470> you're<00:02:02.890> in<00:02:03.040> bed<00:02:03.220> or<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.520> go<00:02:03.640> to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
you bend over you're in bed or you go to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.840 
you bend over you're in bed or you go to
sit<00:02:03.940> down<00:02:04.150> in<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.930> car<00:02:05.140> or<00:02:05.320> something<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:05.979> it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
sit down in a car or something and it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.210 
sit down in a car or something and it
doesn't<00:02:07.090> stay<00:02:07.840> down<00:02:08.110> very<00:02:08.409> good<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.649> don't<00:02:08.830> know

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
why people they do that I think it's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.290 
why people they do that I think it's
obviously<00:02:11.980> supposed<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.370> keep<00:02:12.550> cold<00:02:13.000> air<00:02:13.180> from

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
obviously supposed to keep cold air from

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.080 
obviously supposed to keep cold air from
coming<00:02:13.480> up<00:02:13.690> underneath
