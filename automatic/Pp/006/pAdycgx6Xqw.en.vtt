00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.619
 this religious smoothie we go to the recipe 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.290
 the ingredients that you have to use to 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.470
 about 700 liters of milkshake are half pineapple 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.660
 2 branches of celery 2 apples a banana and 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.300
 200 milliliters of milk without lactose in 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.370
 if you are intolerant we first cut the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.920
 pineapple and chop it like the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.600
 banana apples and celery after 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.989
 We put in the American glass or blender 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.250
 the milk and we go alternating in the fruit 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.129
 we started shredding them for space 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.199
 10 seconds at high speed and as you 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.670
 I said this cough shake has many 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.920
 beneficial properties for health 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.989
 pineapple for its high content 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.430
 bromeliad improves circulation and we 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.710
 prevents the formation of clots 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.140
 but it is also a natural digestive 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.570
 because bromelia helps digest the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.580
 proteins which favors digestion and 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.920
 contains pectin that helps prevent 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.280
 constipation also contains vitamins 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.070
 iodine magnesium phosphorus and calcium useful 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 for the thyroid and nerve cells 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.490
 and another aspect to keep in mind is that 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.229
 has manganese that helps the body 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.420
 produce collagen what is a protein 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.340
 fibrous and resistant that helps 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.810
 build connective tissues like 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.790
 the bones beat and the cartilages 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.680
 the afro maybe is not in your 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.390
 list of favorite foods but 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.399
 combined with the rest of fruits is 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.049

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.630
 Toxins also has a diuretic effect 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.710
 95 percent of water does not provide 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.439
 vitamin ab series as well as sodium sulfur 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.080
 and iron magnesium potassium phosphorus and 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.240
 calcium 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.490
 the apple is one of the most 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.110
 complete and enriching by the great 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.380
 amount of nutrients that are found 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.509
 in it 85% of its composition is water 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.150
 so it's very refreshing and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.310
 moisturizer is of rapid assimilation in 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.310

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.470
 potassium content excels potassium 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.230
 vitamin E although discrete source 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 possesses antioxidant action intervenes in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.470
 the stability of blood cells 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.020
 like the red blood cells and in the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.640
 fertility also has potassium that is 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.950
 a mineral necessary for transmission 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.020
 and generation of nerve impulse and for 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.300
 normal muscle activity 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.280

 ideal energy for everyone 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.630
