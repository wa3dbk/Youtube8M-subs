00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.290
 we are going to factor in 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:12.540
 irreducible the polynomial 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:19.520
 vx equal to xa the fifth 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.520
 + 3x to the fourth minus 4 x cubed 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.779
 - 12 x squared 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 good the point math is we can 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.810
 see in the polynomial videos of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.720
 factoring that polynomials 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.870
 irreducible 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.970
 are those who can not express themselves 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.040
 as a product of two degree polynomials 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.449
 greater than or equal to one and they are two 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.449
 grade one polygons 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.030
 and the polynomials of degree 2 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.470
 and roots 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.600
 real therefore factoring the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.360
 previous polynomial as a product of 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.790
 irreducible grade polynomials would be 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.660
 write it as a product of why I do not 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.869
 is of degree 1 and polynomials of degrees and 2 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.660
 without real roots good first thing 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 is done here is to draw common factor from the 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.689
 x of lesser degree 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.520
 let's notice that the lesser X 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.189
 it was meant that we can not take out factor 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.869
 common x squared each of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.240
 those summing we hold x to the fifth 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 we approach x to the square we would decrease 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.679
 endorsed exponent x to the cube plus 3 x to the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.799
 fourth we decrease by 2 x to every less 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:38.880
 4 x to the cube we decrease in 2 x raised to 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.409
 1 - 12 x squared 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.520
 outside and now we take this and this 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.649
 polynomial from here let's factor what 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 independent term is minus 12 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.890
 we can assume that it is 12 the value 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.180
 absolute the integer divisors the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.310
 independent term 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.700
 are the whole numbers that come to you 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.880
 12 we started with 11 minus 12 minus 23 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.400
 minus 3 also divide 12 4 - 4 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.060
 also and we get to 5 that does not divide it 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.100
 we do not put it and minus 5 on 6 and less 6 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.240
 that divide it and now until you reach 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.120
 12 and minus 12 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.860
 once we have this, we take 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.930
 this polynomial here and let's go 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.820
 trying to see if we have a network when 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.890
 let's have a reality automatically 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.220
 factor we hoist because we know that a 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.070
 root number a if x minus a divides the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.070
 polynomial then we start with the 1 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 we have 13 of the 4 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.340
 12 we are in this polynomial here and 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.800
 now we start at 1 we went down 11 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.519
 by 11 subjects 141 by 44 this its end and 0 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.660
 1 for 0 0 - 12 the rest has not given us 0 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.170
 the column serves us and will not serve anymore 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.900
 at no later time than this 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.940
 problem as root of the polynomials that 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.269
 let's go get what we're going with at least 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.269
 one 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:27.010
 we lower one minus one to one 1 3121 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:32.770
 by 2 - 2 - 42 minus 6 minus one per 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.340
 minus 6 is 6 - 12 6 minus six is ​​not 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.300
 gets subtracted 0 does not work either 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 we continue now with the 2 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:49.700
 13 4 12 we go down 12 for about 23 25 25 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.700
 10 24 10 6 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.840
 2 for 612 here we have not been wrong 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.880
 12 that's why I was hesitating and here 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.840
 so in this case yes you get 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.890
 and we have that 2 is root then x 2 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.590
 we know from the ruffin rule and it would be 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.769
 a divisor because the rest has given us 0 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.549
 and this would be the quotient be divisor by 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.950
 quotient plus rest we will put divisor is 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.880
 x minus the value that we have here in 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.580
 this case x minus 2 by the quotient as 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.830
 this one has grade 3 that would come now 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.630
 they would have grain 2 their coefficients would be 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:39.010
 1 x squared 5 x 60 x square plus 5 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.350
 x plus 6 and now let's see that 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.409
 we have irreducible factors here xxx 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.300
 X squared 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:51.479
 and now x minus 2 and the factory tamos x 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.139
 square 5 x if we can take advantage of this 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.139
 what we have here 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.250
 and here we put 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.130
 we had stayed in 2 on 2 as 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:09.580
 has given root we continue with the 2 we go down 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:13.780
 the 12 for about 25 27 and 2 for 7 14 620 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.750
 subtracted different from 0 does not serve flames and 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.110
 now we would take 156 we continue in the 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.910
 order and the minus two minus two we go down 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.590
 the 1 good this too we could 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.120
 do solving the second equation 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.790
 degree and we will also get the roots 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.940
 but we continue with the end and minus two by 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:35.729
 one minus 25 minus 23 minus two times three 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.729
 minus 60 the good thing that has 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.300
 what to solve the equation is that with 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.570
 this method we only detect the roots 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.280
 entire may not be the roots 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.169
 whole then with the equation of 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.630
 second degree yes you get the 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:57.070
 real roots good from here we would have 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:59.920
 the divisor x 2 x 2 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.410
 as we put here x + 2 and now the 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.130
 quotient plus the rest that is 0 the expense 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.560
 it does not get like this has grade 2 that 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.870
 would come here now I would have degree 1 it would be 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.840
 1 x + 3 x 3 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.090
 and let's see that we have already decomposed 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.680
 our polynomial as a product of 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.940
 irreducible factors putting us 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.750
 irreducible x xx xx minus 2 x x 2 xx 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.750
 + 3
