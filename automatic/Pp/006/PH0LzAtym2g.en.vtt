tighten it just a hair I got it and

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.659 
tighten it just a hair I got it and
you'd<00:04:41.050> hold<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.349> in<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.469> blade<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.949> kind<00:04:42.610> of

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
you'd hold it in the blade I kind of

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.909 
you'd hold it in the blade I kind of
lurked<00:04:42.939> for<00:04:43.270> just<00:04:43.509> a<00:04:43.599> tiny<00:04:43.990> bit<00:04:44.409> I<00:04:44.560> mean<00:04:44.740> just

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
lurked for just a tiny bit I mean just

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.529 
lurked for just a tiny bit I mean just
very<00:04:45.610> very<00:04:46.139> barely<00:04:47.139> noticeable<00:04:47.650> but<00:04:48.539> wasn't

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
very very barely noticeable but wasn't

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.839 
very very barely noticeable but wasn't
quite<00:04:50.229> to<00:04:50.500> my<00:04:50.650> expectation<00:04:51.310> so<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.520> had<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.699> just

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
quite to my expectation so I had to just

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.909 
quite to my expectation so I had to just
tighten<00:04:51.969> it<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.270> little<00:04:52.330> bit<00:04:52.719> and<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.680> screw

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
tighten it a little bit and the screw

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.459 
tighten it a little bit and the screw
just<00:04:53.979> makes<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.370> blade<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.550> little<00:04:54.759> tighter

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
just makes the blade a little tighter

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.469 
just makes the blade a little tighter
now<00:04:56.469> there's<00:04:56.680> no<00:04:56.770> play<00:04:56.979> at<00:04:57.099> all<00:04:57.479> missile
