like<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.359> just<00:00:54.420> saw<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.929> end<00:00:55.079> grain<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
like I just saw in the end grain of that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.919 
like I just saw in the end grain of that
piece<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> red<00:00:56.339> oak<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.359> other<00:00:57.570> thing<00:00:57.809> that's

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
piece of red oak the other thing that's

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.660 
piece of red oak the other thing that's
really<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.469> important<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.160> what's<00:00:59.460> called

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
really really important is what's called

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.759 
really really important is what's called
the<00:00:59.760> hook<00:00:59.969> angle<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> teeth<00:01:00.839> shown<00:01:01.499> right

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
the hook angle on the teeth shown right

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.259 
the hook angle on the teeth shown right
here<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> blade<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> negative<00:01:02.999> five

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
here on the blade it's a negative five

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.660 
here on the blade it's a negative five
now<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> means<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
now what that means is that when you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
now what that means is that when you
look<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.060> teeth<00:01:06.330> themselves<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:07.800> tooth

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
look at the teeth themselves that tooth

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060 
look at the teeth themselves that tooth
is<00:01:08.580> leaning<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.420> away<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.560> cut<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is leaning back away from the cut at a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.850 
is leaning back away from the cut at a
negative<00:01:11.550> degree<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
negative degree what we want to do is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
negative degree what we want to do is
make<00:01:14.070> sure<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> real

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
make sure that you don't get a real

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.440 
make sure that you don't get a real
strong<00:01:16.110> positive<00:01:16.470> hook<00:01:16.980> on<00:01:17.160> this<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:18.000> could

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
strong positive hook on this that could

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
strong positive hook on this that could
be<00:01:18.720> grabby<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> material<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.370> you're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
be grabby on the material that you're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
be grabby on the material that you're
trying<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> cut<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.390> negative<00:01:22.230> five<00:01:22.440> is<00:01:22.470> good

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
trying to cut so negative five is good

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.120 
trying to cut so negative five is good
up<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.000> positive<00:01:24.600> seven<00:01:25.410> as<00:01:25.770> far<00:01:26.100> as

grind<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.070> great<00:02:43.310> choice<00:02:43.550> for<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.900> if

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
grind is a great choice for that if

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900 
grind is a great choice for that if
you're<00:02:45.110> primarily<00:02:45.380> working<00:02:45.980> with<00:02:46.460> solid<00:02:46.880> wood

an alternate top bevel tooth pattern

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.910 
an alternate top bevel tooth pattern
will<00:02:49.820> work<00:02:50.000> fine<00:02:50.270> for<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> bunch<00:02:51.800> of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
will work fine for that so a bunch of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.440 
will work fine for that so a bunch of
characteristics<00:02:52.730> here<00:02:52.910> make<00:02:53.120> sure<00:02:53.270> you're

going to get this blade back on the saw
and<00:02:57.260> show<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.980> how<00:02:58.100> well<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.580> does

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and show you just how well it does

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.940 
and show you just how well it does
crosscut<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.780> even<00:03:00.140> something<00:03:00.350> non-ferrous

thing<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.690> notice<00:03:08.900> about<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.380> approach<00:03:09.800> is

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
thing to notice about this approach is

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.520 
thing to notice about this approach is
that<00:03:10.280> I've<00:03:10.760> got<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> wooden<00:03:11.480> block<00:03:11.630> behind<00:03:12.440> the

aluminum angle iron to support it that's
going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.810> help<00:03:14.960> make<00:03:15.140> sure<00:03:15.200> we<00:03:15.530> don't<00:03:15.680> get<00:03:15.800> a

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
going to help make sure we don't get a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.350 
going to help make sure we don't get a
lot<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.070> burrs<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.610> inside<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.180> cut
