00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.189 
bit on my finger and I would rub it on
my<00:00:26.099> piercing<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.849> well<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.119> inside<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:28.050> nose

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
my piercing as well as inside my nose

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
my piercing as well as inside my nose
and<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.400> I'd<00:00:29.490> wash<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:29.970> warm<00:00:30.179> water<00:00:30.390> or

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
and then I'd wash it with warm water or

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.820 
and then I'd wash it with warm water or
I'd<00:00:30.840> rinse<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.349> warm<00:00:31.650> water

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
I'd rinse it out with warm water

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
I'd rinse it out with warm water
thoroughly<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> no<00:00:33.239> soap<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.850> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
thoroughly so that no soap is like you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030 
thoroughly so that no soap is like you
know<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.000> still<00:00:36.270> there<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
know I'm still there because that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.840 
know I'm still there because that
wouldn't<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.399> good<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.980> psycho<00:00:41.399> cable

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
wouldn't be good and this psycho cable

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
wouldn't be good and this psycho cable
I'd<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> two<00:00:42.780> times<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.200> day<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I'd do that two times a day in the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'd do that two times a day in the
morning<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:45.300> night<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> another

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
morning and at night and so another

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
morning and at night and so another
thing<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:51.149> only<00:00:51.329> used<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> clean<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:51.989> nose<00:00:52.230> ring

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
thing I only used to clean my nose ring

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.450 
thing I only used to clean my nose ring
two<00:00:53.070> different<00:00:53.340> ways<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.129> washed<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> with

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
two different ways so I washed it with

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
two different ways so I washed it with
antibacterial<00:00:56.879> soap<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.800> still<00:00:59.100> get

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
antibacterial soap and I would still get

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.500 
antibacterial soap and I would still get
with<00:01:00.030> sea<00:01:00.359> salt<00:01:01.280> really<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> mean<00:01:03.180> it'll

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
with sea salt really well I mean it'll

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
with sea salt really well I mean it'll
be<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> different<00:01:04.080> packaging<00:01:04.530> different

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
be in different packaging different

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
be in different packaging different
packages<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> from<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.689> local

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
packages if you get it from your local

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.320 
packages if you get it from your local
drugstore<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.299> could

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
drugstore but you think you could

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.760 
drugstore but you think you could
probably<00:01:09.600> find<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.320> health<00:01:10.590> food

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
probably find this like at health food

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.600 
probably find this like at health food
stores<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.479> mine<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.750> Walmart

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
yeah I got mine at Walmart and basically

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.960 
yeah I got mine at Walmart and basically
what<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:19.100> put<00:01:20.100> 1/4<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> teaspoon

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
what I would do is put 1/4 of a teaspoon

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.260 
what I would do is put 1/4 of a teaspoon
of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> sea<00:01:22.170> salt<00:01:22.380> into<00:01:22.830> an<00:01:23.040> 8<00:01:23.220> ounce<00:01:23.400> cup<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
of the sea salt into an 8 ounce cup of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.990 
of the sea salt into an 8 ounce cup of
hot<00:01:24.540> water<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.200> I'd<00:01:26.009> let<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> set<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
hot water and I'd let it set for a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
hot water and I'd let it set for a
little<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> salt<00:01:28.560> would

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
little bit just so the salt would

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
little bit just so the salt would
dissolve<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> stuff<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.210> I'd

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
dissolve and all that stuff and then I'd

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
dissolve and all that stuff and then I'd
soap<00:01:30.750> my<00:01:31.170> nose<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:31.950> literally

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
soap my nose like I would literally

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.950 
soap my nose like I would literally
stick<00:01:33.000> my<00:01:33.150> nose<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.590> 8<00:01:34.799> ounce<00:01:35.040> cup

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
stick my nose in this little 8 ounce cup

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
stick my nose in this little 8 ounce cup
for<00:01:36.960> 15<00:01:37.439> minutes<00:01:38.509> 15<00:01:39.509> minutes<00:01:40.009> 3<00:01:41.009> times<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.490> day

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
for 15 minutes 15 minutes 3 times a day

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.510 
for 15 minutes 15 minutes 3 times a day
well<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.420> always<00:01:42.720> did<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.899> three<00:01:43.140> times<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.470> day

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
well I always did it three times a day

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.210 
well I always did it three times a day
when<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.960> had<00:01:45.960> time<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> weekends<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
when I had time like on the weekends I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.289 
when I had time like on the weekends I
did<00:01:47.399> three<00:01:47.520> times<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.820> day<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.429 
did three times a day like on the
weekdays<00:01:48.689> I'd<00:01:48.840> probably<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
weekdays I'd probably do it in the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
does clean it really good because I had

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.310

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
probably should because they say that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.699
