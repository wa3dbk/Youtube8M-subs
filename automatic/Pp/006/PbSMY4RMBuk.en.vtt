close-up<00:03:45.260> shots<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.650> anything<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.340> want<00:03:46.580> this

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
close-up shots of anything you want this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.170 
close-up shots of anything you want this
is<00:03:47.660> really<00:03:47.840> cool<00:03:48.080> if<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.320> try<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:49.180> put

is really cool if you try like to put

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.850 
is really cool if you try like to put
your<00:03:50.209> camera<00:03:50.959> close<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.320> someone's<00:03:51.650> eye<00:03:51.799> you

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
your camera close to someone's eye you

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.710 
your camera close to someone's eye you
can<00:03:52.130> see<00:03:52.310> like<00:03:52.459> inside<00:03:52.910> there<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.570> can

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
can see like inside there I and you can

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.979 
can see like inside there I and you can
just<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:54.470> can<00:03:54.500> read<00:03:54.920> something<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:56.209> could

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
just you can read something you could

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.720 
just you can read something you could
just<00:03:57.110> get<00:03:57.320> really<00:03:57.440> close<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.310> it's

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
just get really close to it and it's

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.720 
just get really close to it and it's
going<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.970> take<00:03:59.090> some<00:03:59.120> time<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.600> focus<00:03:59.840> but

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
going to take some time to focus but

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.420 
going to take some time to focus but
it's<00:04:01.730> going<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.000> be<00:04:02.120> like<00:04:02.269> pretty<00:04:02.540> cool<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.560> if

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
it's going to be like pretty cool so if

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.690 
it's going to be like pretty cool so if
you<00:04:04.549> want<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.880> see<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:06.310> zoom<00:04:07.310> into<00:04:07.459> like

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
you want to see like zoom into like

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.670 
you want to see like zoom into like
flowers<00:04:08.180> or<00:04:08.329> something<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:09.019> see<00:04:09.230> like<00:04:09.410> really

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
flowers or something and see like really

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.830 
flowers or something and see like really
close<00:04:09.829> up<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.280> what<00:04:10.430> they're<00:04:10.579> made<00:04:10.730> of<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
close up of what they're made of the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.340 
close up of what they're made of the
macro<00:04:12.260> would<00:04:12.769> be<00:04:12.980> best<00:04:13.280> for<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:14.019> now<00:04:15.019> if<00:04:15.230> you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
macro would be best for that now if you

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.930 
macro would be best for that now if you
want<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.800> use<00:04:16.010> your<00:04:16.220> wide<00:04:16.400> angle<00:04:16.760> all

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
want it to use your wide angle all

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.400 
want it to use your wide angle all
you're<00:04:17.090> going<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.239> do<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.570> take<00:04:17.870> off<00:04:18.109> your

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
you're going to do is take off your

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
you're going to do is take off your
bottom<00:04:18.560> lip

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
bottom lip

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.060 
bottom lip
so<00:04:20.630> tape<00:04:21.630> you're<00:04:22.320> going<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.530> take<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.860> off

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
so tape you're going to take that off

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.460 
so tape you're going to take that off
you're<00:04:23.640> going<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.880> flip<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.290> facing

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
you're going to flip it so it's facing

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.930 
you're going to flip it so it's facing
down<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.250> then<00:04:26.370> you're<00:04:26.490> going<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.670> quit

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
down and then you're going to quit

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.060 
down and then you're going to quit
battle<00:04:27.300> ok<00:04:27.570> so<00:04:27.630> now<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.560> wine<00:04:28.770> angle

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
battle ok so now I have the wine angle

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.980 
battle ok so now I have the wine angle
on<00:04:29.190> um<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:30.150> doesn't<00:04:30.570> really<00:04:30.690> look<00:04:30.930> like

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
on um this doesn't really look like

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.070 
on um this doesn't really look like
anything<00:04:31.740> but<00:04:32.730> it's<00:04:33.090> really<00:04:33.660> good<00:04:33.840> if<00:04:33.960> you

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
anything but it's really good if you

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.750 
anything but it's really good if you
want<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.440> if<00:04:34.740> you're<00:04:35.070> far<00:04:35.280> away<00:04:35.400> from

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
want to if you're far away from

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.340 
want to if you're far away from
buildings<00:04:36.030> or<00:04:36.330> something<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.080> really

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
buildings or something and you really

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.380 
buildings or something and you really
want<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.590> get<00:04:37.740> like<00:04:37.890> everything<00:04:38.730> in<00:04:38.850> one<00:04:39.060> in

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
want to get like everything in one in

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.690 
want to get like everything in one in
one<00:04:39.420> shot<00:04:39.870> or<00:04:39.900> what<00:04:40.170> I<00:04:40.200> or<00:04:40.470> one<00:04:40.800> angle<00:04:41.160> you

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
one shot or what I or one angle you

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.600 
one shot or what I or one angle you
would<00:04:41.850> use<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.240> wide<00:04:42.450> angle<00:04:42.600> lens<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.610> yeah

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
would use the wide angle lens and yeah

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.830 
would use the wide angle lens and yeah
that's<00:04:44.760> what<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.590> nothing<00:04:46.590> really<00:04:46.860> special

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
that's what it is nothing really special

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.610 
that's what it is nothing really special
but<00:04:48.840> it's<00:04:49.530> still<00:04:49.800> cool<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.160> have<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:52.350> if<00:04:52.470> you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
but it's still cool to have so if you

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.530 
but it's still cool to have so if you
want<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.130> that's<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.760> wine<00:04:53.940> angle<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.450> if

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
want it to that's the wine angle and if

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
want it to that's the wine angle and if
you<00:04:54.800> wanted<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.890> use<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.190> 10<00:04:56.400> *<00:04:56.640> macro<00:04:57.410> are<00:04:58.410> you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
you wanted to use the 10 * macro are you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.440 
you wanted to use the 10 * macro are you
going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.770> do<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:05.610> once<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:05.940> take<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.180> off

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
going to do and once you take that off

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.820 
going to do and once you take that off
you're<00:05:06.570> going<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.750> have<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.930> 10<00:05:07.110> *<00:05:07.320> macro<00:05:07.740> and

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
you're going to have the 10 * macro and

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.550 
you're going to have the 10 * macro and
again<00:05:08.130> this<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.850> going<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.030> let<00:05:09.210> you<00:05:09.560> get

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
again this is going to let you get

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.630 
again this is going to let you get
really<00:05:10.830> close<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.250> objects<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:14.370> would<00:05:14.520> be

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
really close to objects so it would be

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.730 
really close to objects so it would be
best<00:05:14.820> if<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.120> did<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.330> review<00:05:15.720> like<00:05:16.140> outside<00:05:16.320> and

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
best if I did a review like outside and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.220 
best if I did a review like outside and
like<00:05:16.860> zoomed<00:05:17.100> into<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.640> full<00:05:17.880> of<00:05:18.120> flowers<00:05:19.020> or

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
like zoomed into like full of flowers or

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.050 
like zoomed into like full of flowers or
something<00:05:19.980> that<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.400> really<00:05:20.520> wanted<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.940> get

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
something that you really wanted to get

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.910 
something that you really wanted to get
close<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:23.570> but<00:05:24.570> this<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.080> what<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.350> does<00:05:25.500> just

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
close to but this is what it does just

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.860 
close to but this is what it does just
gets<00:05:26.490> really<00:05:26.670> close<00:05:26.910> on<00:05:27.150> two<00:05:27.270> objects<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.780> you

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
gets really close on two objects and you

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.140 
gets really close on two objects and you
could<00:05:28.020> see<00:05:28.200> like<00:05:28.380> everything<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:31.700> like<00:05:32.700> your

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
could see like everything and like your

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.910 
could see like everything and like your
your<00:05:33.510> lens<00:05:33.720> is<00:05:33.900> like<00:05:34.050> almost<00:05:34.260> going<00:05:34.590> to<00:05:34.710> touch

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
your lens is like almost going to touch

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.070 
your lens is like almost going to touch
the<00:05:35.160> object<00:05:35.610> but<00:05:36.150> like<00:05:36.390> that's<00:05:36.600> how<00:05:36.780> close

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
the object but like that's how close

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.250 
the object but like that's how close
you're<00:05:37.260> going<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.500> have<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.920> get<00:05:38.840> in<00:05:39.840> order<00:05:40.020> to

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
you're going to have to get in order to

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.650 
you're going to have to get in order to
focus<00:05:40.440> on<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:41.100> something<00:05:41.460> so<00:05:41.670> let's<00:05:42.450> say<00:05:42.630> I

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
focus on to something so let's say I

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.540 
focus on to something so let's say I
wanted<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.050> see<00:05:43.730> my<00:05:44.730> shoe<00:05:44.970> or<00:05:45.150> something<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:46.550> get

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
wanted to see my shoe or something I get

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.600 
wanted to see my shoe or something I get
really<00:05:47.760> close<00:05:48.600> to<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:49.020> in<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:50.220> could<00:05:50.400> see

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
really close to it in you could see

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.080 
really close to it in you could see
everything<00:05:52.010> which<00:05:53.010> is<00:05:53.040> also<00:05:53.400> pretty<00:05:53.760> quiet

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
everything which is also pretty quiet

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:07.630 
everything which is also pretty quiet
really<00:05:54.300> like<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.570> micro<00:05:54.930> lens<00:05:55.140> on<00:05:55.700> this

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.060 

and<00:06:08.640> yeah<00:06:08.820> that's<00:06:09.000> all<00:06:09.420> four<00:06:09.690> clips<00:06:10.080> again<00:06:10.800> if

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
and yeah that's all four clips again if

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.370 
and yeah that's all four clips again if
you<00:06:11.340> wanted<00:06:11.670> to<00:06:11.880> see<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.300> difference<00:06:12.750> with

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
you wanted to see the difference with

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:24.410 
you wanted to see the difference with
the<00:06:13.560> wide<00:06:13.770> angle<00:06:19.310> right<00:06:20.310> I'm<00:06:20.460> going<00:06:20.640> on<00:06:23.420> so

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
the wide angle right I'm going on so

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.720 
the wide angle right I'm going on so
this<00:06:24.600> is<00:06:24.750> a<00:06:24.780> wide<00:06:25.050> angle<00:06:25.260> and<00:06:25.680> if<00:06:26.250> i<00:06:26.340> take<00:06:26.550> it

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
this is a wide angle and if i take it

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.140 
this is a wide angle and if i take it
off<00:06:28.310> that's<00:06:29.310> what<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:29.580> looks<00:06:29.760> like<00:06:29.910> without

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
off that's what it looks like without

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150 
off that's what it looks like without
the<00:06:30.450> wide<00:06:30.630> angle<00:06:30.750> so<00:06:31.080> it<00:06:31.110> does<00:06:31.500> you<00:06:31.680> do<00:06:31.860> see<00:06:32.130> a

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
the wide angle so it does you do see a

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.080 
the wide angle so it does you do see a
difference<00:06:32.660> so<00:06:33.660> that's<00:06:34.140> why<00:06:34.380> dangle<00:06:34.770> on<00:06:35.090> when

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
difference so that's why dangle on when

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.840 
difference so that's why dangle on when
and<00:06:36.210> go<00:06:36.330> off<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:37.830> can<00:06:37.950> see<00:06:38.160> how<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.370> zooms<00:06:38.700> out

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
and go off you can see how the zooms out

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.240 
and go off you can see how the zooms out
a<00:06:38.910> little<00:06:39.150> bit<00:06:40.550> on<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:42.330> off<00:06:42.680> with<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.770> fisheye

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
a little bit on and off with the fisheye

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.760 
a little bit on and off with the fisheye
I<00:06:46.820> have<00:06:47.820> to<00:06:47.940> screw<00:06:48.180> it<00:06:48.300> on<00:06:48.420> but<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:49.350> fish<00:06:49.560> I<00:06:49.710> you

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
I have to screw it on but the fish I you

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.730 
I have to screw it on but the fish I you
do<00:06:50.070> get<00:06:50.310> a<00:06:50.340> lot<00:06:50.720> closer<00:06:51.720> to<00:06:52.080> your<00:06:52.230> things<00:06:52.380> so
