one of my 20 gallon tanks but I kind of
want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.189> over<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.400> key<00:00:29.820> points<00:00:30.240> with

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
want to go over some key points with

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
want to go over some key points with
this<00:00:30.810> soil<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> will<00:00:31.679> show<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.949> how

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
this soil and then it will show you how

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.400 
this soil and then it will show you how
to<00:00:32.250> use<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.540> what's<00:00:33.719> nice<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:33.960> this

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to use it so what's nice about this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.049 
to use it so what's nice about this
there's<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> wash<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.520> before<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
there's no need to wash it before you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.810 
there's no need to wash it before you
use<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.610> want

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
use and what you want to do is you want

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.799 
use and what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:39.090> lower<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.050> water<00:00:40.200> level<00:00:41.149> then<00:00:42.149> put<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to lower the water level then put this

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.889 
to lower the water level then put this
in<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> water<00:00:45.090> level<00:00:45.570> just

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
in and then have the water level just

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
in and then have the water level just
low<00:00:46.140> enough<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.800> plant<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> tank<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
low enough so you can plant the tank and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
low enough so you can plant the tank and
that<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.570> isn't<00:00:48.750> dispersed<00:00:49.440> into<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that way this isn't dispersed into the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.330 
that way this isn't dispersed into the
water<00:00:50.129> too<00:00:50.399> much<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> filters<00:00:52.340> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
water too much or into the filters so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.150 
water too much or into the filters so
what<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.239> thing<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> remember<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
what a thing to remember with this is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
what a thing to remember with this is
your<00:00:56.370> tank<00:00:56.670> water<00:00:56.969> may<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.600> cloudy<00:00:57.840> after<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
your tank water may get cloudy after you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
your tank water may get cloudy after you
set<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> best

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
set this up but if you have the best

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
set this up but if you have the best
filtration<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.129> filtration<00:01:02.340> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
filtration or some good filtration on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
filtration or some good filtration on
there<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> should<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.049> your

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
there that you should have on your

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
there that you should have on your
aquarium<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:05.430> should<00:01:05.700> dissipate<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> clear

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
aquarium that should dissipate and clear

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.859 
aquarium that should dissipate and clear
up<00:01:06.869> within<00:01:07.320> no<00:01:07.650> problem<00:01:08.600> also<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:09.750> you're

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
up within no problem also when you're

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
up within no problem also when you're
doing<00:01:10.080> water<00:01:10.320> changes<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.729> soil<00:01:12.060> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
doing water changes with this soil in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390 
doing water changes with this soil in
the<00:01:12.420> aquarium<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:13.409> sure<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> stir<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.310> up

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the aquarium make sure not to stir it up

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.450 
the aquarium make sure not to stir it up
too<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.720> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.460> kick

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
too much because that will kind of kick

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.590 
too much because that will kind of kick
everything<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.939> may<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.299> caught<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
everything out may get caught in the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.370 
everything out may get caught in the
filter<00:01:19.130> cloud<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> tank<00:01:20.549> again<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.119> bit

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
filter cloud the tank again a little bit

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.749 
filter cloud the tank again a little bit
but<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> shouldn't<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> problem<00:01:22.920> also

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
but it shouldn't be a problem also

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
but it shouldn't be a problem also
another<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> keep<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.689> mind<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.080> don't

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
another thing to keep in mind is don't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
another thing to keep in mind is don't
position<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> outflow<00:01:27.060> pipe<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> filter

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
position the outflow pipe of the filter

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
position the outflow pipe of the filter
basically<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.189> such<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> water

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
basically in such a way that the water

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
basically in such a way that the water
flow<00:01:30.600> directly<00:01:31.140> hits<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> soil<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.159> again

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
flow directly hits the soil and again

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.880 
flow directly hits the soil and again
stirs<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> said

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
stirs it up and that can like I said

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.109 
stirs it up and that can like I said
disperse<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> dirt<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.310> settled<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
disperse the dirt that has settled and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
disperse the dirt that has settled and
again<00:01:39.570> make<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> water<00:01:40.049> cloudy<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.979> not

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
again make the water cloudy it's not

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
again make the water cloudy it's not
going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> hurt<00:01:41.579> anything<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> don't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
going to hurt anything but you don't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.260 
going to hurt anything but you don't
want<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.899> cloudy<00:01:43.170> aquarium<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> basically

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
want a cloudy aquarium and basically

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.780 
want a cloudy aquarium and basically
this<00:01:45.479> water<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.530> soil<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.100> tended<00:01:47.759> for

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this water is or this soil is tended for

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.130 
this water is or this soil is tended for
freshwater<00:01:50.119> aquariums<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.270> aquatic<00:01:51.780> plants

this<00:03:37.120> is<00:03:37.269> kind<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.600> what<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.810> looks<00:03:37.989> like<00:03:38.109> I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
this is kind of what it looks like I

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.110 
this is kind of what it looks like I
really<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.650> soil<00:03:39.160> because<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.639> really

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
really like this soil because it really

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.690 
really like this soil because it really
makes<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.510> plants<00:03:40.930> pop<00:03:41.310> now<00:03:42.310> I'll<00:03:42.430> be<00:03:42.549> adding

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
more live plants to this I'll probably

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.220

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and that way I can make this a little

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.009 
and that way I can make this a little
bit<00:03:51.489> nicer<00:03:51.910> but<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.269> going<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.660> become
