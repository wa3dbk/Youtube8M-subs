00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
it's hot it's wicked hot and and and I

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.110 
it's hot it's wicked hot and and and I
guess<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.770> mean<00:00:07.890> sometimes<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:09.030> know

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
guess I mean sometimes you know

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
off running

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
off running
you're<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.460> sprinting<00:01:29.970> down<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> road<00:01:30.509> with

you're just sprinting down the road with
your<00:01:31.290> comp<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.079> it<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.530> fun<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
your comp and and like it was so fun I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
your comp and and like it was so fun I
mean<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.460> crazy<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.329> super<00:01:36.659> chaotic<00:01:36.900> but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
mean it was crazy it's super chaotic but

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
mean it was crazy it's super chaotic but
when<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> rains<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.930> dumps<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.460> dumps
