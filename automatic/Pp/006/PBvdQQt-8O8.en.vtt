00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.460
 yeah 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.449
 they 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.989
 I'll tell you how to do it 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.169
 of course 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.009
 patrol wobbly 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.999
 which sheds 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.289
 this complex 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.659
 for this we need 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.349
 developer 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.349
 in polemics with lazio 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.419
 with this approach 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.140
 soldering iron 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.230
 but a little later 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
 he uses 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 all the same to one desktop 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 tomorrow is not needed yet 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
 developer of the initial stage 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 as one end notes 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.080
 we will meet 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.340
 the architect won't question just 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.450
 prematurely 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.470
 Drives and I found a typo 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.470
 what is 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 so you see the equal of means 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 do you want to be very stubborn 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.330
 now his 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.440
 helped soldered by acid already 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.170
 professes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140
 Means a soldering iron seen enough 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 any minute your club 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.750
 here for example cable 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.480
 film paris 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 the first piece appropriated 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.490
 and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.140
 we believe 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 deputy 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.540
 make you grow across the surface 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.310
 points 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 that is, we are on received sq.m 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 that's how it turns out 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.879
 no further 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.669
 coast of florida 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.119
 we take scissors 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.909
 and design 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.909
 small piece of foil 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.129
 so that 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.129
 wrap and ict pens 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.689
 that's better there is such a thing 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 v.but regulator five hundred st 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
 and again everyday 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.809
 in the case of such a tip 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
 both clubs bearing 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519
 look what happened 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.039
 Moscow 14 48 percent 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.710
 in the Korsakov catalog 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.710
 afanasyev 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.979
 aif 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.939
 the main innovation of this is not enough 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.439
 no heaven 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.710
 it means 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.029
 i used slovenia 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.229
 but generally 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.319
 ooo center 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.819
 place flags can moscow st 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.089
 besides myself if there is 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.770
 sportswoman 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.330
 the main thing to help her words about 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.810
 shelf 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.039
 but today 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.539
 hello she was afraid 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.979
 of suppliers 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.229
 the same day is no longer coming off the ldpm 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.400
