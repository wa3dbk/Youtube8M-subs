your cocktail making so first of all if
you<00:00:21.900> want<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.650> lime<00:00:23.640> juice<00:00:24.029> um<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.930> best

you want to do a lime juice um the best

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
you want to do a lime juice um the best
thing<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.710> some<00:00:25.890> minor<00:00:26.189> fingers<00:00:26.609> but

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
thing to do is some minor fingers but

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.429 
thing to do is some minor fingers but
cut<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.449> down<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> middle<00:00:27.720> then<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.260> you're

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
cut it down the middle then when you're

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.130 
cut it down the middle then when you're
putting<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.920> into<00:00:29.090> what<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.269> call<00:00:30.539> Mexican<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
putting it into what we call Mexican the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.549 
putting it into what we call Mexican the
elbow<00:00:31.590> put<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.510> way<00:00:33.750> around<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
elbow put it in this way around so that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.350 
elbow put it in this way around so that
the<00:00:35.390> top<00:00:36.390> bridge<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.010> line<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.579> facing<00:00:39.180> out

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the top bridge of the line is facing out

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.650 
the top bridge of the line is facing out
at<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> goes<00:00:40.739> against<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.579> most<00:00:42.360> people

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
at you so it goes against it most people

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.510 
at you so it goes against it most people
do<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> other<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.170> around<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
do it the other way around and the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.279 
do it the other way around and the
reason<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.750> squeeze

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
reason for that is that when you squeeze

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.369 
reason for that is that when you squeeze
you<00:00:46.680> won't<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.700> eye<00:00:47.760> so

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
you won't get it into your eye so

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.150 
you won't get it into your eye so
generally<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.680> about<00:00:50.010> 25<00:00:50.730> mil<00:00:52.160> depending

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
generally that's about 25 mil depending

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.430 
generally that's about 25 mil depending
on<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.670> big<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.059> line<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.020> looks<00:00:55.289> about

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
on how big your line is that looks about

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
on how big your line is that looks about
15<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.829> 15<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.949> 25<00:00:59.579> mil<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.329> it's

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
15 to me but 15 to 25 mil and it's

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.039 
15 to me but 15 to 25 mil and it's
always<00:01:01.170> good<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> UM<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.930> typically<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
always good to UM just typically the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
always good to UM just typically the
straw<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> taste<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.189> bitter<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:08.450> yes

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
straw to taste out bitter that is yes

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.539 
straw to taste out bitter that is yes
that's<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.780> nice<00:01:09.930> fresh<00:01:10.200> one

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that's a nice fresh one

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:27.050 
that's a nice fresh one
so<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.390> showing<00:01:12.600> oranges

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.470 

I'm<00:01:28.110> fundamentally<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.830> best<00:01:30.040> way<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.480> cut

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
I'm fundamentally the best way to cut

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.400 
I'm fundamentally the best way to cut
your<00:01:31.510> line<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:32.550> straight<00:01:33.550> down<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.940> middle

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
your line is straight down the middle

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.200 
your line is straight down the middle
with<00:01:35.410> your<00:01:35.530> Mexican<00:01:35.710> elbow<00:01:36.430> make<00:01:36.670> sure<00:01:36.940> that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
with your Mexican elbow make sure that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.500 
with your Mexican elbow make sure that
your<00:01:37.420> line<00:01:37.600> goes<00:01:38.130> Bridge<00:01:39.130> way<00:01:39.430> up<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.240> the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
your line goes Bridge way up so that the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.780 
your line goes Bridge way up so that the
bridge<00:01:41.080> of<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.530> facing<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.190> this<00:01:42.430> means

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
bridge of it is facing you this means

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.850 
bridge of it is facing you this means
that<00:01:43.030> when<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.300> squeeze<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.810> doesn't<00:01:44.200> fly<00:01:44.650> up

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
that when you squeeze it doesn't fly up

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.800 
that when you squeeze it doesn't fly up
into<00:01:45.100> your<00:01:45.340> eye<00:01:45.370> or<00:01:45.760> anyone<00:01:46.060> else's<00:01:46.420> eye<00:01:46.570> and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
into your eye or anyone else's eye and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.580 
into your eye or anyone else's eye and
then<00:01:47.410> you<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.310> press<00:01:48.430> hard<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:50.200> have

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
then you just press hard they have

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.100 
then you just press hard they have
generally<00:01:51.840> 15<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.960> 25<00:01:53.410> mil<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.950> flesh<00:01:54.490> line<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
generally 15 to 25 mil of flesh line and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.840 
generally 15 to 25 mil of flesh line and
that's<00:01:56.350> how<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.620> squeeze<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.040> line<00:01:57.370> with<00:01:57.820> a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
that's how to squeeze a line with a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.750 
that's how to squeeze a line with a
Mexican<00:01:58.120> elbow
