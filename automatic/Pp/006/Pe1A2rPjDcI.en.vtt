00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.939
 and the most beautiful 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.969
 for the cycle 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.559
 you scared me so much you came 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.130
 here did not listen to their complaints 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.869
 and talk to a very serious topic that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 probably still not aware of my affairs 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 the most important and serious and can not give 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.349
 your precious time on you really 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 you ca n't just serve me 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.430
 and you never thought 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.899
 that I like too, like this 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 sit in the evening 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.129
 and experiment with your new 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.000
 cosmetic and I would definitely not refuse 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000
 dressing table 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 you know that I generally sleep standing on a shelf 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.649
 so you still lucky me at all 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.289
 there is no bed and it seems to me that something was 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 unfair if someone had more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.449
 than the rest of it is certainly true tom 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 that our lagoon has both a table and souls 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.030
 bed for sure we completely forgot about 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.030
 our lagoon wow 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.759
 what not let's get all down on me 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.909
 somehow stupid well why can't you 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:23.140
 put notice that you already have 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.479
 You did not think so, and so immediately 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.789
 my gifts why don't you head nothing 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.729
 created of course can not vadim on with 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.840
 all blame quiet quiet girls are not 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:38.649
 quarrel I brought sweets from fate 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.130
 going through knots to be a hurricane 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.210
 now everyone calmed down we will live 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.979
 share with everyone and give in to everyone 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.590
 found here reign to me here at all 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:56.220
 nothing is silently not expressing my 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.220
 I canâ€™t sleep while standing
