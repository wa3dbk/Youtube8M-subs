00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.100
 such granules are felt solid 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.970
 big that's all metal 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:36.970

 just dirt is wear terrible there 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.770
 the idea should be transparent 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.150

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.920
 they are worn out now we are all there 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.540

 rinse it all pour clean oil and 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.760
 add 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 composer 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.190
 in short, they filler 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.940
 all diesel fuel more accurately poured you 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.240
 present 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.240
 about my 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.920
 front axle 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.830
 but 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.030
 will not come because you are the top 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.920
 pond 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.920
 august flight postponed put 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.530
 here here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.490
 he is the same 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.490
 of course 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.500
 here even large granules well yes i see 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.880
 but I don't know here so giving off 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.180
 backlight and it will be worse, well, not visible 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.709
 illumination is not very 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.120
 large yes well, that's probably all 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.120
 metal stitches undermine 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.290
 actually for this you are under interrogation 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:02.780
 tigran and very large year it's 20 thousand 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.780
 kilometers of all new car 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.520
 he oils 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.950
 many divorces with some kind of metal 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:19.700
 impurities are not char beggars as if it were 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.940
 not a new bridge, but I donâ€™t know what you left 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.940
 collected from the landfill and how then 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.740
 he can be seen as shavings along the bottom take a floor 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.949
 What a little push on the brake is not so 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:59.949
 strong 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.800
 this handouts 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.060
 this look gives us everything from her 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.060
 such sounds 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:03.750
 fill with diesel fuel that could be seen were 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.750
 washing so let's say neatly only 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:26.340
 well yes of course I study diesel fuel was 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.970
 transparent base, too, with a divorce 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.500
 stone 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:35.310
 no cups were not out of place progulochku 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:40.550
 expelled magnet gathered how much 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.550
 shavings here it is after washing the diesel fuel 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.630
 will clean 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.439
 he is 8 night cosmodisk 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.880
 so pure magnet pretty honestly i 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.080
 I ask even if it is interesting to listen 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:12.770
 here is pure reading by building it 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:18.340
 give this hall the lower fault lies much 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.340
 less than have time why 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:33.900
 Here we pour oil in 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.900
 liquidate moth all from 5 to 140 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.860
 Show me 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.800
 not overdo it 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.880
 Well, in general, just exactly the level 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:09.240
 everything turns out like 3 liters three jars 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:15.229
 here they are three cans two bridges 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.229
 nothing remains
