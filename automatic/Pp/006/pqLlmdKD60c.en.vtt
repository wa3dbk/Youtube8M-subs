this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.930> picture<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.439> ocean<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.070> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
this is the picture of the ocean and the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.789 
this is the picture of the ocean and the
water<00:00:02.370> cycle<00:00:02.669> right<00:00:05.750> first<00:00:06.750> here<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
water cycle right first here is a

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.970 
water cycle right first here is a
picture<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.340> Sun<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.450> Sun<00:00:09.719> heats<00:00:10.410> up<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
picture of the Sun the Sun heats up the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.959 
picture of the Sun the Sun heats up the
ocean<00:00:11.929> then<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.380> ocean<00:00:13.830> starts<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.549> evaporate

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
ocean then the ocean starts to evaporate

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.150 
ocean then the ocean starts to evaporate
and<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.990> sky<00:00:16.260> after<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.750> evaporates

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
and go into the sky after it evaporates

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
and go into the sky after it evaporates
it<00:00:20.160> doesn't<00:00:20.730> sense<00:00:20.939> guy<00:00:21.180> makes<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.689> cloud<00:00:24.289> after

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it doesn't sense guy makes a cloud after

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
it doesn't sense guy makes a cloud after
it<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.500> condensates<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.400> starts<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it a condensates it starts to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
it a condensates it starts to
precipitate<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.750> rain<00:00:28.789> after<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.179> rains<00:00:30.570> it

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
precipitate and rain after it rains it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.650 
precipitate and rain after it rains it
starts<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.099> collection<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.880> one

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
starts to going collection like this one

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:44.750 
starts to going collection like this one
and<00:00:33.989> these<00:00:34.380> other<00:00:34.829> pictures<00:00:43.430> then<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> goes

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and these other pictures then it goes

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
and these other pictures then it goes
back<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> ocean<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.500> water<00:00:46.680> cycle

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
back to the ocean and the water cycle

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.209 
back to the ocean and the water cycle
starts<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.670> over<00:00:48.000> again

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
starts all over again

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.590 
starts all over again
this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.489> water<00:00:50.820> cycle<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> Sun

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.260 

when<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> Sun<00:00:57.989> heats<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.980> evaporates<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
when the Sun heats up it evaporates the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.649 
when the Sun heats up it evaporates the
ocean<00:01:02.930> then<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.710> evaporates<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:06.030> makes<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
ocean then as it evaporates it makes the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.300 
ocean then as it evaporates it makes the
clouds

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.640 

also<00:01:13.310> as<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.880> clouds<00:01:14.180> get<00:01:14.570> heavy<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.140> full<00:01:15.620> of

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
also as the clouds get heavy and full of

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.360 
also as the clouds get heavy and full of
water<00:01:18.550> then<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.810> cloud<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.830> ready<00:01:22.100> to

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
water then the cloud is ready to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.969 
water then the cloud is ready to
precipitate<00:01:25.270> then<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.660> happens<00:01:27.260> is<00:01:27.620> it

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
precipitate then what happens is it

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.170 
precipitate then what happens is it
collects<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:30.170> starts<00:01:30.470> all<00:01:30.680> over<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:35.000> Sun

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
collects and it starts all over the Sun

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.730 
collects and it starts all over the Sun
gives<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:35.570> devotion<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.380> there's<00:01:36.560> other

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
gives you devotion and there's other

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.440 
gives you devotion and there's other
batteries<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:40.010> vapor<00:01:40.369> goes<00:01:40.610> into<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> cups

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
batteries the vapor goes into the cups

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.430 
batteries the vapor goes into the cups
and<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.740> content<00:01:43.190> states<00:01:44.290> what<00:01:45.290> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
and then it content states what the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:55.350 
and then it content states what the
clouds<00:01:45.710> are<00:01:45.920> really<00:01:46.130> happy<00:01:46.759> they<00:01:47.180> precipitate

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.630 

after<00:01:56.360> collection<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.680> water<00:01:57.890> cycle<00:01:58.220> starts

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
after collection the water cycle starts

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.340 
after collection the water cycle starts
all<00:01:58.850> over<00:01:59.390> again

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the way the Sun is helping the water

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.580 
the way the Sun is helping the water
evaporate<00:02:12.709> from<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> sea<00:02:17.200> when<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.230> water

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
evaporate from the sea when the water

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.880 
evaporate from the sea when the water
gets<00:02:18.950> too<00:02:19.220> hot<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:20.030> hot<00:02:20.330> bath<00:02:21.320> awaits<00:02:21.530> for

when the waddle awaits it go up

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.070 
when the waddle awaits it go up
into<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.800> cut<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.520> then<00:02:31.670> grabbed<00:02:32.240> on<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.540> a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
into the cut and then grabbed on to a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.400 
into the cut and then grabbed on to a
little<00:02:33.530> piece<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.770> dust<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.730> then<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.600> form<00:02:36.319> of

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
the cloud so when the class can put it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.020 
the cloud so when the class can put it
up<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.920> ways<00:02:43.430> also<00:02:44.330> know<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> at<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.160> Eclipse

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
up the ways also know so at the Eclipse

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.390 
up the ways also know so at the Eclipse
and<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:50.870> keep<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.260> going<00:02:51.560> for<00:02:51.830> generations

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
and then keep on going for generations

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.300 
and then keep on going for generations

evaporation on earth after the heat

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.430 
evaporation on earth after the heat
comes<00:03:04.430> from<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> Sun<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.480> goes<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.140> ocean

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
comes from the Sun it goes to the ocean

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.040 
comes from the Sun it goes to the ocean
and<00:03:06.950> makes<00:03:07.340> evaporation<00:03:10.390> with<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.420> little<00:03:11.870> bit

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
and makes evaporation with a little bit

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.949 
and makes evaporation with a little bit
of<00:03:12.170> dust<00:03:12.410> added<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.550> vapor<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:14.360> becomes

the way into the ocean and the water

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.330 
the way into the ocean and the water
cycle<00:03:37.190> starts<00:03:37.640> all<00:03:37.820> over<00:03:38.060> again

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.220 

I'm<00:03:42.340> Rebecca<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.180> I'm<00:03:43.480> going<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.870> tell<00:03:44.080> you

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
I'm Rebecca and I'm going to tell you

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.060 
I'm Rebecca and I'm going to tell you
about<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.740> water<00:03:44.980> cycle<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.830> Sun

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
about the water cycle this is the Sun

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.070 
about the water cycle this is the Sun
the<00:03:48.310> Sun<00:03:48.340> starts<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.360> whole<00:03:49.600> process<00:03:52.080> first

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
the Sun starts the whole process first

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.520 
the Sun starts the whole process first
the<00:03:53.380> cell<00:03:53.910> evaporates<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.180> water<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:56.350> it

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
the cell evaporates the water and it

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.120 
the cell evaporates the water and it
goes<00:03:56.770> up<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:58.480> then<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:59.230> turns<00:03:59.620> into<00:03:59.770> clouds

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
goes up and then it turns into clouds

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.850 
goes up and then it turns into clouds
which<00:04:00.850> then<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.390> clouds<00:04:01.660> get<00:04:01.930> too<00:04:02.170> heavy<00:04:02.440> and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
which then the clouds get too heavy and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.640 
which then the clouds get too heavy and
then<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:04.060> precipitates<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.050> falls<00:04:05.320> on<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
then it precipitates and falls on the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.370 
then it precipitates and falls on the
ground<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.340> then<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:07.150> goes<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.510> collection

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
ground and then it goes to collection

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.410 
ground and then it goes to collection
and<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.890> starts<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.400> whole<00:04:09.490> water<00:04:10.000> cycle

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
and that starts the whole water cycle

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.050 
and that starts the whole water cycle
all<00:04:10.540> over<00:04:10.570> again
