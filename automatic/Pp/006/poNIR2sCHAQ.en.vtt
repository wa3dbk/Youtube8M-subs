00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
two things and you see that it flings

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.700 
two things and you see that it flings
you<00:01:16.530> through<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.159> now<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.500> VZ

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you through this now this is the VZ

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.520 
you through this now this is the VZ
this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.790> easy<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> easiest<00:01:22.229> part

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this is now easy like the easiest part

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.210 
this is now easy like the easiest part
pick<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.540> put<00:01:25.260> it<00:01:25.350> down<00:01:25.470> again<00:01:25.590> now

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
pick it up take it put it down again now

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
pick it up take it put it down again now
you<00:01:26.280> might<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.970> 20<00:01:27.750> times<00:01:28.280> or

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you might have to do this 20 times or

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.250 
you might have to do this 20 times or
about<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.030> does<00:01:30.210> work<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.810> happened<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
about but it does work what happened is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.930 
about but it does work what happened is
it'll<00:01:31.440> fling<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> forward<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.610> onto<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
it'll fling you forward more onto the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.350 
it'll fling you forward more onto the
bed<00:01:33.060> till<00:01:33.240> sprint<00:01:35.659> C<00:01:36.659> plug<00:01:37.140> me<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:38.240> pick<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
bed till sprint C plug me more pick it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.160 
bed till sprint C plug me more pick it
up<00:01:40.580> do<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.670> again

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
up do it again

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.310 
up do it again
this<00:01:43.170> might<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.710> fact<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:45.000> bit

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
this might in fact take a little bit

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
this might in fact take a little bit
wait<00:01:46.320> till<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.530> hear<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> sound<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.240> flag

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.560 

it<00:01:58.030> does<00:01:58.240> take<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.690> bunch<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.680> tries<00:01:59.980> but<00:02:00.570> it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
it does take a bunch of tries but it's

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.040 
it does take a bunch of tries but it's
worth<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.020> now<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:04.060> punch<00:02:04.510> afford<00:02:06.780> pick<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.900> up

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
I hope it doesn't break while I'm doing

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.900 
I hope it doesn't break while I'm doing
this<00:02:10.990> but<00:02:11.350> it's<00:02:11.860> best<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.160> have<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.370> brand<00:02:12.790> new

see you keep going forward like more

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.030 
see you keep going forward like more
onto<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> bed<00:02:29.430> um<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.930> yeah<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
onto the bed um but yeah this is like a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.560 
onto the bed um but yeah this is like a
high<00:02:33.190> round<00:02:33.489> glitch<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.000> pick<00:02:34.120> up<00:02:34.239> drops

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
high round glitch you can pick up drops

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.900 
high round glitch you can pick up drops
from<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.620> they'll<00:02:35.800> either<00:02:35.950> go<00:02:36.220> though<00:02:36.580> they'll

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
from so they'll either go though they'll

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.140 
from so they'll either go though they'll
either<00:02:37.060> run<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.720> way<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.790> way

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
either run that way or to this way

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.260
