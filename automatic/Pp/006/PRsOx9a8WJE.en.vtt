00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
so then what I'm gonna do is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.050 
so then what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:02:23.540> gonna<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:23.930> my<00:02:24.110> rubbing<00:02:24.440> alcohol<00:02:25.060> I'm

like<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.770> little<00:02:32.410> thicker<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.800> see

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
like this to be a little thicker to see

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.500 
like this to be a little thicker to see
if<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.190> pour<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.580> now<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.090> gonna<00:02:35.209> run
