 Hi everyone today Mac Advice is going to be on how to increase the speed of your Web Browser 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:14.059
 and search by using a free application called namebench. What this does is that actually 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.940
 look for the fastest DNS servers that are in your area and the network, 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.610
 in order to increase the speed of your navigation. Now the DNS servers are configured in your network 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.440
 Preferences and I'll show you where to change them once you run through this report. 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 But the first thing that is needed is to get the application. Go to the website that you ndicated 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 in the comments section and click on the Linke download for the Mac DMG file, download it and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 open it in your download folder open it and copy the application to your desktop 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.170
 or application folder. After making it run the application and it will open and click on 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 the start button will run for a time going through thousands of posiibbilities and when 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.170
 a report will appear that looks like this that will basically give you the 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.679
 suggestions for a faster DNS service for you to use. In my case what really told me that 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:29.679
 I would be 40.1 percent faster if I change the DNS servers to the 3 suggested here. I 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.939
 will show you now how to change them in your network settings. Go to the apple menu go 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.939
 to the preferences system came to the network, click advanced, click on the DNS tab and on this 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.420
 case I already put the new ones in but I'm going to delete them to show you that you do not have 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.840
 to save them, if I click on them individually and press the minus sign all there is of them can 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.490
 to be removed when I take off I received another 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 from my DHCP configuration. So in order to put the new ones in click on the plus sign they're going 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.069
 the report copy them one at a time and paste them one to the time.Click twice to get 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.340
 The highlight of light blue and paste. When your done click OK, then do not forget to hit apply 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.400
 Once your done restart your web browser and you should have an increase in speed. this 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.400
 It is a great application and its free and made me speed up, I highly recommend it. its 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.359
 Great advice and good luck and navigate faster.
