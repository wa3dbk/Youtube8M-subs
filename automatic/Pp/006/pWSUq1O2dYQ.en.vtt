let's see if we can spot where these

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.479 
let's see if we can spot where these
guys<00:03:34.220> are<00:03:34.459> going<00:03:34.610> down<00:03:36.130> or<00:03:37.130> where<00:03:37.310> they're

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
coming up from this seems to be just

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:54.690 
coming up from this seems to be just
right<00:03:44.360> over<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.780> there

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.970 

there's<00:03:55.210> another<00:03:55.510> one<00:03:55.750> coming<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.350> see<00:03:56.890> him

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
there's another one coming in see him

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.710 
there's another one coming in see him
back<00:03:57.190> there<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.670> white<00:03:58.090> clouds<00:03:58.390> back

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
back there on the white clouds back

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.020 
back there on the white clouds back
there<00:03:58.959> yeah<00:04:02.010> something's<00:04:03.010> attracting<00:04:03.670> them

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.680 

stupid<00:04:07.030> bug

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:24.770 

they<00:04:14.320> are<00:04:14.500> working<00:04:15.010> their<00:04:15.160> way<00:04:15.190> up<00:04:15.370> wind

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.739 

he's<00:04:25.530> dropping<00:04:25.800> down<00:04:26.130> really<00:04:26.400> fast

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.629 

so<00:04:33.289> I'd<00:04:33.469> say<00:04:33.649> we'd<00:04:33.860> probably<00:04:34.069> have<00:04:34.279> something

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
so I'd say we'd probably have something

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:47.439 
so I'd say we'd probably have something
dead<00:04:34.999> over<00:04:35.029> there

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.749
