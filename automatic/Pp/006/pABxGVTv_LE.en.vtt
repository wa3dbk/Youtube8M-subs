00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 on the outside beautiful viola on the inside bread 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.170
 but what does this saying have to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.019
 to see with the new mountain is that underneath 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.990
 of this screen inspired by agile body 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.850
 the new compact pickup truck of the GM hides a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.789
 platform that is older than 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.310
 that she replaced or is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.560
 same as the veteran Corsican classic who is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.349
 of two generations past 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.179
 everything to reduce costs of production 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 for those who expected something new from gm 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.660
 another disappointment since the agile them the same 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.360
 sorry philosophy because this old 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 platform brings some problems where 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.100
 not allow stability to be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 waiting for a new car or the insulation 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.550
 acoustic is that it does not have the subchassi 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.760
 as in the current Corsican at least 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 draws attention to the size that places it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 among compact pickups and medium to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 front fell very well 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.520
 the new one- hour shock with the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.739
 bust and the bucket has 1,100 liters of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 ability to carry large 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.110
 a set of wife and that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 pleases fans of this type of car only 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.140
 still lacking a version with 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360
 extended cabin 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.820
 the masters and know what almost the greatest 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
 success 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.060
 the space behind the seats is reasonable and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.009
 in this version sports nets and porta-objects 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.049
 help you take a couple of things 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.270
 people are going well accommodated 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 but the interior should have 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 best quality and finer grips 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 neat in general 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.500
 to compensate does not jump so much even empty 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.509
 favoring comfort 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.329
 a cool detail of the new mountain is the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.149
 rear visibility for sure. 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.189
 best among the trucks segment not 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.380
 It's a wonder but the format of the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.640
 glass cover and the hopper cover 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.979
 makes a task easier. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.830
 talk about a bucket solution 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.990
 the key on the lid allows a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.900
 greater protection objects left inside 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.950
 and the activation of the system which 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.300
 the steppe avoiding mechanical bore not 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.540
 There's news 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.690
 uses the chevrolet 1.4 econoflex e 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.880
 provides excellent 102 horses when 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 with alcohol and allows you to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.190
 reasonable performance but when it is 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.290
 empty with load feels lack of torque 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.050
 which is only possible with the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.330
 bigger cylinder at this time of longing 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.970
 The old and drunk 1.8 problem if 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.220
 also reflects consumption and should be 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350
 best for the engine of this size 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 one needs to accelerate a lot to have 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.380
 consistent answers mainly 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.209
 when it is charged it ends up spending a 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.110
 position to drive higher in relation to 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.250
 to foreign exchange coupons and awards 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.380
 efficient 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.989
 the pleasure of driving is only committed 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.220
 in the corners since it killed it have a tendency 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.650
 getting out of training 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.040
 another habit in all items of 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.980
 safety and standard equipment but 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.720
 do not be fooled by this good relationship 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.790
 a larger engine and a 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.690
 more modern chassis and should 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.690
 part of package 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.620
 curious to know the notes 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:32.120
 so let's go and say 'I know' consumption 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:37.030
 7 security 9 stability 7 finishing 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.690
 6 internal space 7 bucket 9 relation 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.480
 cost-effective 8 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.450
 the chevrolet montana 1.4 sport has 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.970
 price of 44 thousand and forty reais 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.489
 the only option is the metallic paint 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.489
 which costs more 827
