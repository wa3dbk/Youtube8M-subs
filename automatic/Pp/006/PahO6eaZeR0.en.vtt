yardage you know anywhere from like ten
to<00:01:38.909> forty<00:01:39.210> yards<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.780> pretty<00:01:39.990> typical

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
to forty yards will be pretty typical

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.010 
to forty yards will be pretty typical
especially<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.939> people<00:01:42.060> who<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.540> hand

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
especially for people who are hand

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
especially for people who are hand
spinning<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.619> yarn<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.280> can't

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
spinning the yarn because you can't

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
spinning the yarn because you can't
really<00:01:44.790> fit<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.149> much<00:01:45.479> yarn<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> spinning

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
really fit that much yarn on a spinning

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.460 
really fit that much yarn on a spinning
wheel<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.460> inch<00:01:47.640> across

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
wheel one it's an inch across

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.410 
wheel one it's an inch across
so<00:01:49.470> here's<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> couple<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.130> examples<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.939> super

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so here's a couple of examples of super

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.490 
so here's a couple of examples of super
bulky<00:01:51.600> yarn<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.350> a

of them are some of the ploys are thick
as<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> thumb<00:02:01.799> across<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.240> two<00:02:03.450> plies

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
as a thumb across this is just two plies

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.630 
as a thumb across this is just two plies
if<00:02:04.049> naturally<00:02:04.590> dyed

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
if naturally dyed

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.260 
if naturally dyed
all<00:02:06.360> died<00:02:06.690> with<00:02:06.900> us<00:02:07.140> tick<00:02:07.850> which<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> pretty

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
all died with us tick which is a pretty

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.920 
all died with us tick which is a pretty
cool<00:02:09.450> plant-based<00:02:09.959> diet<00:02:11.480> gives<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.630> really

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
cool plant-based diet gives a really

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.500 
cool plant-based diet gives a really
nice<00:02:13.080> golden<00:02:13.830> color<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.330> when<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
nice golden color to it so when you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
nice golden color to it so when you
compare<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.050> super<00:02:16.410> bulky<00:02:16.590> yarn<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> fairly

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
compare the super bulky yarn to a fairly

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.620 
compare the super bulky yarn to a fairly
typical<00:02:18.620> bulky<00:02:19.620> weight<00:02:19.800> yarn<00:02:20.450> dyed<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
typical bulky weight yarn dyed and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.260 
typical bulky weight yarn dyed and
fairly<00:02:22.050> similar<00:02:22.320> colors<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.150> can

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
fairly similar colors you can you can

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.699 
fairly similar colors you can you can
see<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.750> almost<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.290> particular

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
see that it's almost this one particular

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.220 
see that it's almost this one particular
one<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.950> almost<00:02:26.100> twice<00:02:26.580> as<00:02:26.640> thick<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.930> try<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
one is almost twice as thick so try and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
one is almost twice as thick so try and
substitute<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.740> pattern<00:02:29.040> between<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.400> two<00:02:29.550> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
substitute a pattern between the two of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.000 
substitute a pattern between the two of
them<00:02:29.790> wouldn't<00:02:30.060> work<00:02:30.180> very<00:02:30.480> well<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.500> so

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
them wouldn't work very well and so

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.920 
them wouldn't work very well and so
here's<00:02:32.190> another<00:02:32.400> example<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.390> super<00:02:33.720> bulky

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
here's another example of a super bulky

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.470 
here's another example of a super bulky
yarn<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:35.850> see<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:37.560> has<00:02:37.770> great<00:02:38.220> coils<00:02:38.910> spun

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
yarn you can see it has great coils spun

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.630 
yarn you can see it has great coils spun
into<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.530> should<00:02:40.739> make<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.250> really

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
into it it should make for a really

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.630 
into it it should make for a really
interesting<00:02:42.890> fabric<00:02:43.890> since<00:02:44.100> they're<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.489> are

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
interesting fabric since they're in are

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.690 
interesting fabric since they're in are
spaced<00:02:44.970> every<00:02:45.330> couple<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.780> yards<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
spaced every couple of yards this is a

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.259 
spaced every couple of yards this is a
type<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.090> yarn<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.540> used<00:02:48.900> for<00:02:49.440> one<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.950> my

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
type of yarn that I used for one of my

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.610 
type of yarn that I used for one of my
little<00:02:51.269> wrap<00:02:51.480> patterns<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.170> called<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
little wrap patterns it's called the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160 
little wrap patterns it's called the
butterfly<00:02:52.800> shrug<00:02:53.459> which<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.510> available<00:02:54.690> on

it's<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:59.070> best<00:02:59.310> part<00:02:59.640> about<00:02:59.780> bulky<00:03:00.780> yarns

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
it's the best part about bulky yarns

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.190 
it's the best part about bulky yarns
that<00:03:01.110> are<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.500> thick<00:03:01.860> but<00:03:02.670> not<00:03:03.019> super<00:03:04.019> much

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that are this thick but not super much

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.110 
that are this thick but not super much
super<00:03:04.739> thicker<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.030> away

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
super thicker is that you can get away

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.470 
super thicker is that you can get away
with<00:03:06.450> using<00:03:07.040> knitting<00:03:08.040> needle<00:03:08.280> size<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.820> in

with using knitting needle size in in

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.060 
with using knitting needle size in in
the<00:03:09.690> teens<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.320> know<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.980> know

the teens you know you don't you know

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.920 
the teens you know you don't you know
once<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.579> get<00:03:11.730> start<00:03:12.209> using<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.570> needles

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
once you get start using the needles

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.500 
once you get start using the needles
that<00:03:13.230> are<00:03:13.320> like<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:13.829> 35<00:03:14.280> or<00:03:14.489> 50<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.450> know
