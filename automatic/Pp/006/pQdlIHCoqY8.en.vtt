00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
exactly sure why this didn't happen

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
exactly sure why this didn't happen
because<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.410> has<00:01:22.590> happened<00:01:22.800> before<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
from an old drive to this one um my

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
from an old drive to this one um my
explanation<00:01:29.190> for<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.760> after

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
explanation for this is that after

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
explanation for this is that after
transferring<00:01:31.200> through<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.800> software<00:01:32.310> called

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
transferring through the software called

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.870 
transferring through the software called
wind<00:01:32.910> klum<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.930> didn't<00:01:34.530> quite<00:01:35.040> transfer<00:01:35.640> all

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
wind klum it didn't quite transfer all

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
wind klum it didn't quite transfer all
the<00:01:35.910> boot<00:01:36.240> files<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:36.960> quite<00:01:37.170> sure<00:01:37.200> that's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the boot files I'm not quite sure that's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.530 
the boot files I'm not quite sure that's
the<00:01:37.800> right<00:01:37.920> explanation<00:01:38.580> for<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.030> that's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the right explanation for it all that's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
the right explanation for it all that's
just<00:01:39.660> my<00:01:39.840> guess<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.440> i'll<00:01:41.430> probably<00:01:41.670> put<00:01:41.910> up

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
just my guess and i'll probably put up

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
just my guess and i'll probably put up
animation<00:01:42.619> well<00:01:43.619> annotation<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.550> very
