00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
let's see if it fires on full auto that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:37.179 
let's see if it fires on full auto that
was<00:01:23.810> weird

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.919 

they're<00:01:38.189> well<00:01:38.789> full-auto<00:01:39.179> just<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
they're well full-auto just then I

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.480 
they're well full-auto just then I
actually<00:01:40.289> know<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.859> was<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.399> was

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
actually know what that was one that was

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.419 
actually know what that was one that was
left<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.880> barrel<00:01:42.560> man<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.859> this<00:01:44.219> thing

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
left in the barrel man it is this thing

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:53.389 
left in the barrel man it is this thing
is<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:44.700> working<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:50.749> you<00:01:51.920> see<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.069> this<00:01:53.189> guy

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is not working so you see where this guy

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:05.569 
is not working so you see where this guy
stopped<00:01:53.819> here<00:02:03.920> doing<00:02:04.920> another<00:02:05.099> one

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
stopped here doing another one

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.380 
stopped here doing another one
I<00:02:05.869> noticed<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:06.929> I<00:02:06.990> slammed<00:02:07.319> these<00:02:07.469> into

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
I noticed when I slammed these into

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.369 
I noticed when I slammed these into
that's<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.569> don't<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.019> supposed<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> do

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that's I don't think it's supposed to do

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:35.319 
that's I don't think it's supposed to do
that<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:25.610> don't<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.700> kind<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.560> kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.620> weird

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.339 

see<00:02:36.329> if<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.480> can't<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> rest<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.230> these

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
see if we can't get the rest of these

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:56.630 
see if we can't get the rest of these
through

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.740 

BB's<00:02:57.640> aren't<00:02:57.880> feeding<00:02:58.090> either<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.690> should

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
BB's aren't feeding either you should

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.940 
BB's aren't feeding either you should
have<00:03:01.960> been<00:03:02.080> able<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.290> go<00:03:02.410> right<00:03:02.560> through<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
have been able to go right through the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.090 
have been able to go right through the
rest<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.340> mag<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:04.770> negative<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.740> that's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
rest of that mag but negative so that's

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.620 
rest of that mag but negative so that's
pretty<00:03:09.460> frustrating<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:10.120> was<00:03:10.240> really<00:03:10.420> hoping

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
pretty frustrating I was really hoping

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.230 
pretty frustrating I was really hoping
for<00:03:10.690> looking<00:03:11.410> forward<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:12.090> blinking<00:03:13.090> with

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
for looking forward to blinking with

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.310 
for looking forward to blinking with
this<00:03:13.420> gun<00:03:13.690> here<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.390> does<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:16.630> seem<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.020> be

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
this gun here but it does not seem to be

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.250 
this gun here but it does not seem to be
the<00:03:18.280> best<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.610> quality<00:03:18.840> guess<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.990> should<00:03:20.170> have

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
the best of quality guess I should have

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:29.430 
the best of quality guess I should have
kept<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.470> other<00:03:20.650> one<00:03:28.050> this<00:03:29.050> one's<00:03:29.260> got<00:03:29.410> a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
kept the other one this one's got a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:04:09.979 
kept the other one this one's got a
