00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.380

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:25.049
 In Tokyo, this movie is another blow or 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.620
 Because or even how to drink about two minutes come in the form to say that we accounted for Kofu cyborg and firewood 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.100

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:44.270

 Body When this changed hands in this way not put your hands

 The place where Pita stops will be spread and then the water will be turned back here 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:12.250
 Then, it is 9 minutes to drain the water 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:18.040
 It makes it easy to open the sound aside and this date and time, and the memory 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:24.580
 There are also many people who are too conscious to shut and they are drained . 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.970
 In this way firmly If you come by changing the court of Te upper left corner of the law Yogi Here, the Gu' 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.810

 The sense of occupying the good is going to be so important that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.090
 It will be awareness by disqualification in Bora-san I'll go give in to death raised to tighten 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.220

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.100
 The do not want the wrong a was kept firmly Toka does not not mean I'll exceed the square 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.650
 Got it in the state 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:08.280
 Slowly mouth without 's support type is only an early form should be to occupy the ball 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.570
 Where is called'll conscious at the time to put the power to unplug still slot to put a little power 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.920
 If possible 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.540
 The number of seconds that swims a yourself 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.080
 About the time 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.860
 It is better to be able to 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.860

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.500
 How I thought it was a training that everyone had ever done 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.640
 I will 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.380
 But training for that place 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.260
 As I said at the beginning, I do not do it consciously 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:48.390
 It changes at all Collecting one thing after all 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.500
 It's so important to do things, so if you just do this all the time 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.720
 There is not, though 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.209
 The Tteyuu this and this is it leads even thing about swimming when to do this large training 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.670
