00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello everyone, you are not a warrior today, we 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.640
 continue the theme halloween sat and i 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.680
 tell you how to make a cool 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.980
 candlesticks made of scrap materials 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.170
 and how to decorate candles Khala 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 tested so let's start with apple 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 candlesticks for this we need 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.470
 Naturally apples and candles 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.820
 as well as a knife cut off the tops of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.119
 apples and cut out their hole 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.310
 cutoff size 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.279
 so here is just a quick and autumn 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.570
 we made funny candlesticks 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.940
 now go to the orange 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 candlestick here I want to offer you 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 for two options first let's 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.230
 do as our apples did not 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 for the full atmosphere we will draw here 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:54.270
 Jack the next version of the candlestick of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.489
 orange is orange jack so 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.820
 let's draw a jack here first 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.820
 we cut off the hat 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.170
 cut out the orange from the top 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.070
 because we need a hat 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.830
 and spoon spoon bumper from the very 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.560
 orange and tender hide oranges 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.770
 skins like this should happen and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.410
 Now we cut our eyes and our mouth 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.690
 that somehow I did it now 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:41.270
 we put a candle in here probably better and 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:43.680
 first burn bulk zeiss close and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 simka hall orange jam ready 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.820
 so next candlestick which 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.920
 I suggest you make it wont 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.840
 half-liter painted candlesticks 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.100
 banks 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.550
 naturally we will need half a liter 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.509
 can of paint gouache if there is acrylic 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.990
 that's great 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.880
 orange and black tassel candles 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.190
 Naturally, if you wish, you can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.190
 a piece of ribbon draw jack 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.720
 insides peephole mouth and nose ohm not 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.940
 painted over now we take orange paint and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.250
 paint the whole jar like this 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.160
 I got a jar now I 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.620
 From above I will decorate it with a little ribbon and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.280
 so the candlestick is ready to be inserted 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.400
 him a candle and the last thing i offer 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.230
 you make it decorate our candles for 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 this we need naturally candles 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.040
 but surely thicker than thicker candles 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.450
 the better the safety technique 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.840
 try we need it different 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.990
 ribbons black orange scissors also 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.209
 the power of ethics can say that if you 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.860
 find napkins with Halloween themes 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.860
 it will be much better than printouts 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 also we will need a teaspoon and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.070
 lighter 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.640
 so I'll start with the thickest white 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.770
 candle and various silhouettes see what 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.890
 I will do so I choose the silhouette 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:19.330
 the next thing I did was warming up the spoon 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.550
 I apply a lighter to the candle 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.019
 such that the hot spoon melts the wax 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.090
 our whole and sticks to this bridge 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.980
 naturally if you take a napkin then 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.500
 it will produce much faster and much 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.280
 denser is such original 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.850
 boobs we turned go to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.950
 ribbons what can I offer 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.040
 take a thick wide orange ribbon 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.200
 we have them candles on it 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.200
 now thin black ribbon 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.519
 tying wide and doing here 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.410
 beautiful bow like this 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.760
 simple and pretty halloween style 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.170
 we have a candle 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.170
 the next option is we use the method 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.220
 hot spoons take thin 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.750
 my ribbon, I neatly 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.750
 crushing hot spoon wound 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.540
 Here is such a wonderful candle with us 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.540
 happened 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.050

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.820
