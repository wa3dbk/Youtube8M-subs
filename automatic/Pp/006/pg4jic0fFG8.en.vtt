00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
then we're going to look for a game

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.330 
then we're going to look for a game
that's<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.799> number<00:01:05.540> like<00:01:06.540> 4<00:01:07.130> now<00:01:08.130> here's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that's an even number like 4 now here's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
that's an even number like 4 now here's
the<00:01:08.490> thing<00:01:08.689> you<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.290> number

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the thing you want an even number

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.030 
the thing you want an even number
because<00:01:11.510> chances<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.860> people

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
because chances are all them people

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770

unfortunately<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> draw<00:01:42.659> game<00:01:43.020> right

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
unfortunately this is a draw game right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.370 
unfortunately this is a draw game right
now

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
now

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.800 
now
now<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.280> mind<00:01:45.520> obliteration<00:01:46.360> was

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
now have in mind obliteration was

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.350 
now have in mind obliteration was
updated<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.369> does<00:01:48.549> have<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.820> time<00:01:49.150> limit

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
updated so it does have a time limit

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.630 
updated so it does have a time limit
which<00:01:49.689> means<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.710> game<00:01:50.920> will<00:01:51.100> not<00:01:51.280> just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
which means the game will not just

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.810 
which means the game will not just
continue<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.240> stall<00:01:52.780> out<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.430> do<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.790> a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
continue to stall out so you do have a

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.480

getting bombs delivered is very

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.530 
getting bombs delivered is very
challenging<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.519> possible<00:03:16.120> because<00:03:16.239> I've

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
challenging it is possible because I've

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.560 
challenging it is possible because I've
done<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.790> for<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> people<00:03:19.450> that

can get in a helicopter that is the

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.550 
can get in a helicopter that is the
