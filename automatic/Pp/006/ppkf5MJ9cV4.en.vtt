00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.929
 Dear subscribers, this continuation is almost 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 684 we continue surveyors and now 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.830
 us legion commander and lifestyle shooter 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.710
 Well, in the end of course we will add 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.539
 centaur therefore we won't pull and 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 let's start liftstiller u added 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.060
 awesome ability using which 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.680
 we can hide an ally in 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.420
 this is our ultimate ability 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 it remains we can jump in 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.880
 the enemy is generally just awesome 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.129
 infest a real bomb you represent 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 even the toza combinations will fall for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.290
 tournaments and daddies it's just 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.450
 real fun i think this this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 update just really not for a long time 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.989
 was a good novel and finally we 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.750
 have waited 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 About such combinations will be 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 happen and the fact will jump 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 site fat is behind dream ql will be 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 jump out for some I walked with 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.359
 some svenom or even worse 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.860
 Savik May 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.619
 and it will be just creepy just creepy 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.689
 scary scary will be very interesting 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.549
 see so how about pro scene about 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.320
 players will combine it all i 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 I think that the dotka will be much 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 interesting to be cool all that well, 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.869
 Well very interesting ability 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.930
 added legion commander u with aganim 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.450
 legion commander can put his 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.619
 a drill that never gave a damn 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.689
 will end until one of the players is not 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.420
 will win this door it's ok generally 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.140
 so you think no well, seriously 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.690
 fine 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.100
 endless duel in the description was 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.979
 it is written that the duel can be interrupted 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.909
 only if they are apart 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.479
 a distance of 2.000 it turns out that cult 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.229
 legion will be able to interrupt vespa disruptors 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.080
 and than they can and lush opponent 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:09.789
 somewhere or ally and interrupt 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.010
 ultu let's exclude these heroes and 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.830
 For clarity, let me still I 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.450
 Well I will show the maximum I wish 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.430
 the possibility of how to alienate quel che 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.640
 the whole character and from each other 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.239
 take the puja take the rs in front of the cannon 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.400
 horse breeder 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.760
 his ally once before try it 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.310
 to push this perhaps the maximum 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.130
 maximum distance that can be 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.890
 come up at all in this game to 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 push away heroes well what are we now 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.790
 exhibiting 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.670
 our ally at the right distance for 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.730
 to make everything perfect for us 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.070
 and at the same time I will switch on before 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.290
 I will try to push the shift even further and 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.290
 see if we can stop the dope 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.459
 but no duel stops it 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.190
 the maximum was range which in general 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.349
 could come up in this game of course 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.330
 excluding those abilities that 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.629
 teleport our heroes to different 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.120
 places of migration but actually 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.569
 cool oh yes one more very important 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.879
 Fishechka very important trick spirit when 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.500
 hard not working on allies when 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.470
 worth the duel that is, we can not 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.360
 pull the enemy like this 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.019
 You know, I think if it would be 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.569
 maybe then maybe a duel in theory 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.329
 one could still stop that is in 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.860
 period pulls the gun cabin forward 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.900
 damn repent and push even further 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.180
 perhaps in such a combination could 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.280
 would still stop duel well and centaur 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.940
 added a good opportunity to pass 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.860
 through all the same to the card name Agan ki 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.650
 goods can pass through more correctly 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.110
 and we can also visit the texture i 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.140
 also a good initiation 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.060
 all the skills of Tim have left it the same 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.640
 formerly that is, we also slow down 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.440
 It is applied to stop the enemy 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.450
 damage small and good again 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.910
 initiation let's say 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.780
 initiation fights on Roshan we can 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.780
 just can just attack 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:20.790
 suddenly fall in this way 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.470
 and it can run away well straight all 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.750
 by team 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.570
 So it goes 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.430
 I liked the update serious days in 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.480
 a lot of interesting and there is something 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.080
 reflect on 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.110
 and what's new 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.690
 welcome as it is thanks for the update 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.690
 thanks for subscribing to all bye
