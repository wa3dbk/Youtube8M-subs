00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.980
 the 1-3 who should be ashamed to have voted more taxes for the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.470
 people live from the village 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.769
 and they betray the people 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:08.820
 they have nothing 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.570
 with what to go out to the street they told their constituents that they were going to vote all 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.839
 they told maple readers that they were going to stab them 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.300
 they told their voters they were going to vote because they voted early yesterday no 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.439
 they did not 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.970
 because if they had, they would not have been elected 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.220
 rodríguez 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.190
 that is the subject sectors 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.489
 and the issue is that this gentleman who is that army soldiers 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.200
 to end a national public company 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.690

 because the deputies of the bread that want dialogue and debate 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.430
 can not pay the reasons the arguments the debate 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 and what seems to be a little environment to fulfill 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.510
 the order ventured 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.170
 In front of everyone 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 when they want fellow deputies because I would do the same to them 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.010
 after they voted the taxes against the population in one act 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.860
 criminal 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.170
 irresponsible 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.020
 when there are 60 million poor 40 million in extreme poverty who 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.790
 literally starve 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.550
 it is a gesture that you should think 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.510
 They were 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.120
 pondering what interests 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.930

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.200
 if not play 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.820
