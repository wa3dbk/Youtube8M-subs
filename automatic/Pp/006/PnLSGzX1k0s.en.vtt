00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.490
 here on the street we find today 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.730
 and with this one today I'm going to prepare 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.769
 the juice for 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.769
 to make a mask for hair and 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.510
 After washing the aloe and dry it 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.240
 well we have to wrap it in a paper 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.700
 and leave it in refrigerator for 10 days 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.190
 more or less so that they concentrate better 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.670
 all the properties then we take 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.739
 the aloe and we simply wrap it in 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.890
 a paper wood a paper butter 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.280
 paper you have on hand 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 and so in this way to the true the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.260
 low part for 10 days 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.820
 It's been 10 days since that halo was 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.160
 in refrigerator and today I think of preparing 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.379
 a nourishing hair mask 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.490
 how is Saturday so to take advantage 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.479
 the day and try a little good hair 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.970
 for that what I'm going to do is take 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.100
 some aloe leaves 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.950
 as you see here at the tips are a bit 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.650
 dry is because they were in the area 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.240
 for 10 days as I said 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.130
 they already concentrated all the properties 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 inside of this juice 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 the juice 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.220
 this is not aloe vera is the other aloe 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.330
 but it has the same properties I'm going to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 take three leaves two or three leaves and the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.210
 I will liquefy as well as they are whole in 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210
 a blender 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 as the recipe also carries a new 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 added very directly to the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.789
 processor to the blender and so the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.329
 leaves that were three leaves in total that 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.330
 grip and so you can process easier 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.120
 not in a blender 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.540
 and now I'm going to go through a colander the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.540
 mixture 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.819
 what we need is the juice that then 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.700
 of the oie and the egg that comes out 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.310
 well the mixture already cast returns another 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.090
 Once the processor adds the medium 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.159
 avocado or half avocado and I turn it to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.620
 process like this is staying in our 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.410
 hair mask I'm also going to 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.570
 add oil to a watch 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.520
 extra virgin if you do not have the series of 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.740
 grapes any oil they have can 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.970
 be olive oil sunflower oil 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.690
 provided it is not refined one 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.690
 tablespoon 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.510
 and I'm also going to use a few drops of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.090
 argan oil 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.340
 if they have it they use it because it is very 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.610
 beneficial to the hair does it 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.400
 Brilliant nourishes it and provides it with vitamins 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.370
 minerals and all that good the mask in 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.290
 yes you already have many vitamins and minerals 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:21.209
 so I'm going to add some droplets 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.209
 of this argan oil 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.660
 5 6 7 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.600
 droplets is enough 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.090
 it's good to mark and there you have to use it 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.170
 right away because the lack is oxidized 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.660
 it gets black so once the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.890
 who prepared it by mixing everything well 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.720
 on a dry hair is used 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.140
 on a dry hair that applies 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.300
 mask that mask 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.330
 I always wait half an hour so 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.130
 minus half hour 40 minutes I hope that 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.350
 they liked this homemade recipe for a 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.990
 very nourishing mask 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.790
 it's really easy to do and once 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.329
 per week do it why 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.790
 they will notice the good difference we 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.790
 we see in the next video chao chao
