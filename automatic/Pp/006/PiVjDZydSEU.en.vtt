00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello and welcome white web 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 has been noticed since yesterday 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.810
 new official update for the samsung 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.770

 About 45 mb in size will be the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.730
 Most have already realized that it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.880
 not the much awaited 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.520
 official android 4.1 jelly bean update 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 but a kind of preparation update 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.570
 the update view does not bring any 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 innovations with itself but is like 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 just said a preparatory covering that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 but at the same time it is the last one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 official update before the big jelly 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.460

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 update directly from rms 3 install 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.079
 because they have not already done so 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 It should have been for everyone 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.439

 either you will be taken directly from 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.830
 She then notifies your s3 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.260
 up here in the notification bar or 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.790
 on top of the settings in the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.939

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.200
 click on update 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.119
 then he checks that with the server and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.250

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.140
 shortly before he downloaded it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.340

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.750
 is seen below two minutes with 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.390
 the servers are probably back 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.969
 are also overloaded accordingly 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.590
 because everyone will download this update 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:04.079
 By the way , this is the slick 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.259
 raps this carbon fiber so this 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:17.640

 So for this little info video 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.959
