00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
they do a lot of customization runs it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.029 
they do a lot of customization runs it
runs<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.670> pretty<00:01:26.850> penny<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.420> sitting<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.440> use

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
runs a pretty penny but sitting they use

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.770 
runs a pretty penny but sitting they use
a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.520> mean<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> cabinet<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.330> seems

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a lot of I mean the cabinet it seems

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
a lot of I mean the cabinet it seems
premedia<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.670> little<00:01:32.670> rough<00:01:32.820> around<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> edges

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
premedia a little rough around the edges

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.150 
premedia a little rough around the edges
but<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.080> reuse<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.890> components

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
but so they reuse a lot of components

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.450 
but so they reuse a lot of components
