sheet<00:00:48.960> I've<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.860> made<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> gable<00:00:50.610> end

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sheet I've actually made a gable end

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.049 
sheet I've actually made a gable end
with<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:52.350> sloping<00:00:52.829> sides<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:56.460> idea<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
with these two sloping sides the idea of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.590 
with these two sloping sides the idea of
this<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.920> little<00:00:58.920> sloping<00:00:59.820> sides<00:01:00.120> here

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
this these little sloping sides here

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
this these little sloping sides here
actually<00:01:00.750> follow<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.379> line<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> side<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
actually follow the line of the side of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
actually follow the line of the side of
the<00:01:02.820> box<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> other<00:01:04.409> change<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.010> I've<00:01:05.100> made

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the box the other change that I've made

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.380 
the box the other change that I've made
to<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.390> I've<00:01:06.689> actually<00:01:07.970> devised<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.119> hinge

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to this is I've actually devised a hinge

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.109 
to this is I've actually devised a hinge
this<00:01:10.140> metal<00:01:10.439> strap<00:01:10.830> Elementium<00:01:11.670> strap<00:01:11.939> which

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
this metal strap Elementium strap which

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
this metal strap Elementium strap which
I<00:01:12.210> had<00:01:12.360> lying<00:01:12.540> around

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
I had lying around

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.580 
I had lying around
I've<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.280> bolted<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> lid<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I've actually bolted it to the lid and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.630 
I've actually bolted it to the lid and
I've<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.810> created<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.170> hinge<00:01:19.409> point<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I've actually created a hinge point that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.870 
I've actually created a hinge point that
allows<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.210> open<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.259> top<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.700> just

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
allows me to open the top up and it just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
allows me to open the top up and it just
rests<00:01:24.210> against<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> makes<00:01:28.200> getting

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
rests against here and so makes getting

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
rests against here and so makes getting
in<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.000> easy

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
in and out of this really really easy

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.310 
in and out of this really really easy
I've<00:01:30.930> also<00:01:31.140> cut<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> top<00:01:32.640> bars<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
I've also cut all of the top bars and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.440 
I've also cut all of the top bars and
also<00:01:34.320> some<00:01:34.560> spaces<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.350> floorboards

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
also some spaces and the floorboards

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.340 
also some spaces and the floorboards
which<00:01:39.450> I've<00:01:39.659> made<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.920> also<00:01:41.640> underneath

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
which I've made and then also underneath

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
which I've made and then also underneath
you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.829> see<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.759> I've

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you know if you can see that but I've

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.760 
you know if you can see that but I've
got<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.270> very<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.170> fine<00:01:46.439> 1/8<00:01:47.250> inch<00:01:47.729> mesh<00:01:48.770> which

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
got a very very fine 1/8 inch mesh which

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.999 
got a very very fine 1/8 inch mesh which
I<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.220> nailed<00:01:50.689> underneath<00:01:51.710> I've<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
I have nailed underneath I've got the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.569 
I have nailed underneath I've got the
three<00:01:53.899> entrance<00:01:54.899> holes<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:55.579> will

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
three entrance holes here which will

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.600 
three entrance holes here which will
probably<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:59.210> corks<00:02:00.210> puttin<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:01.369> all<00:02:02.369> by

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
probably have corks puttin them all by

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.940 
probably have corks puttin them all by
one<00:02:03.079> until<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> Beehive<00:02:04.530> gets<00:02:04.829> set<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
one until the Beehive gets set up and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
one until the Beehive gets set up and
put<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> lid<00:02:08.220> back<00:02:08.250> down<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.390> pleased<00:02:09.660> with

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
put the lid back down so pleased with

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.479 
put the lid back down so pleased with
the<00:02:09.929> way<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.170> works<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.190> just

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
the way that works it's just

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.069 
the way that works it's just
there's<00:02:12.700> no<00:02:12.879> wobble<00:02:13.239> or<00:02:13.540> anything<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:14.019> just

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.770 
got the two entrance holes one that each
ends<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.969> can<00:02:22.090> actually<00:02:22.239> split<00:02:22.689> this

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
ends so that you can actually split this

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.229 
ends so that you can actually split this
and<00:02:22.959> have<00:02:23.079> three<00:02:23.349> colonies<00:02:23.829> if<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.129> like<00:02:24.310> in

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
and have three colonies if you like in

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
the one hive what's left to do I need to

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.240 
the one hive what's left to do I need to
find<00:02:31.450> something<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.409> put<00:02:32.590> over<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.099> make

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
find something to put over this to make

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.229 
find something to put over this to make
it<00:02:33.370> weatherproof<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:35.170> leaning<00:02:35.590> towards<00:02:36.239> cool

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it weatherproof I'm leaning towards cool

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.209 
it weatherproof I'm leaning towards cool
flute<00:02:37.510> plastic<00:02:38.139> corrugated<00:02:38.560> plastic<00:02:38.739> at<00:02:39.099> this

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
flute plastic corrugated plastic at this

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.059 
flute plastic corrugated plastic at this
stage<00:02:39.459> because<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.980> really<00:02:41.980> really

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
stage because it's really really

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.330 
stage because it's really really
lightweight<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.569> if<00:02:43.629> it<00:02:43.750> breaks<00:02:43.870> down<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.530> can

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
lightweight and if it breaks down I can

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.099 
lightweight and if it breaks down I can
just<00:02:45.689> pull<00:02:46.689> it<00:02:46.810> off<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.310> put<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> new<00:02:48.400> sheet<00:02:48.760> on

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
just pull it off and put a new sheet on

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.979 
just pull it off and put a new sheet on
so<00:02:50.109> that's<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.439> I'm<00:02:50.530> hoping<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.489> there

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
so that's what I'm hoping to do there

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.629 
so that's what I'm hoping to do there
we've<00:02:52.989> got<00:02:53.109> a<00:02:53.139> local<00:02:53.500> sign<00:02:53.739> maker<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.459> I'll

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
we've got a local sign maker and I'll

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.209 
we've got a local sign maker and I'll
probably<00:02:54.819> get<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.269> get<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.439> core<00:02:56.889> fluid<00:02:57.129> off

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
probably get it get the core fluid off

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.190 
probably get it get the core fluid off
him<00:02:57.459> I'll<00:02:58.239> probably<00:02:58.419> have<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.689> buy<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> sheet<00:02:59.079> of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
him I'll probably have to buy a sheet of

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.209 
him I'll probably have to buy a sheet of
it<00:02:59.290> though<00:02:59.379> which<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.709> bit<00:02:59.859> of<00:02:59.919> a<00:02:59.950> bummer<00:03:00.129> but

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219 
it though which is a bit of a bummer but

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.789 
it though which is a bit of a bummer but
then<00:03:00.969> I<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.209> always<00:03:01.510> use<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.989> other<00:03:02.019> bit<00:03:02.769> of

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
then I can always use the other bit of

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.690 
then I can always use the other bit of
it<00:03:02.950> from<00:03:03.669> the<00:03:03.819> sheet<00:03:04.030> on<00:03:04.569> this<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.519> my

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
it from the sheet on this so this is my

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.059 
it from the sheet on this so this is my
um<00:03:07.829> top<00:03:08.829> bar<00:03:09.010> beehive<00:03:09.400> made<00:03:09.669> out<00:03:09.909> of<00:03:10.950> half<00:03:11.950> a

blue barrel haven't quite finished yet I

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.780 
blue barrel haven't quite finished yet I
ran<00:03:15.790> out<00:03:15.879> of<00:03:15.939> wood<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:16.709> some<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.949> ripped<00:03:18.459> all<00:03:18.609> of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
ran out of wood but some I ripped all of

ran out of wood but some I ripped all of
the<00:03:18.970> top<00:03:19.239> bars<00:03:19.479> down<00:03:19.810> cut<00:03:20.440> them<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.709> length<00:03:21.299> and

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
the top bars down cut them to length and

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.689 
the top bars down cut them to length and
I've<00:03:23.409> just<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.859> need<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.129> do<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> few<00:03:24.459> more<00:03:24.639> of

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
I've just I need to do a few more of

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.649 
I've just I need to do a few more of
them<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:27.519> end<00:03:27.760> piece<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.150> actually<00:03:28.269> going<00:03:28.540> to

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
them this end piece is actually going to

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.949 
them this end piece is actually going to
be<00:03:29.189> screwed<00:03:30.189> in<00:03:30.819> place<00:03:31.060> screwed<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.599> glued<00:03:31.659> in

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
be screwed in place screwed and glued in

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.330 
be screwed in place screwed and glued in
place<00:03:32.310> I'll<00:03:33.310> probably<00:03:33.489> paint<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.120> end<00:03:34.299> piece

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
place I'll probably paint that end piece

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.939 
place I'll probably paint that end piece
that's<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:36.760> create<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.359> right<00:03:37.709> gap<00:03:38.709> this

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
that's just to create the right gap this

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.149 
that's just to create the right gap this
way<00:03:39.220> for<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.879> lid<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.750> then<00:03:41.019> these<00:03:41.229> will<00:03:41.889> sit

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
way for the lid and then these will sit

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.219 
way for the lid and then these will sit
in<00:03:42.459> here<00:03:42.729> like<00:03:42.879> this<00:03:44.939> the<00:03:45.939> entrance<00:03:46.269> hole<00:03:46.750> is

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
in here like this the entrance hole is

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.619 
in here like this the entrance hole is
just<00:03:47.439> the<00:03:47.949> hole<00:03:48.759> from<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> barrel<00:03:49.479> I've

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
just the hole from the barrel I've

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.240 
just the hole from the barrel I've
actually<00:03:50.049> painted<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> outside<00:03:50.709> of<00:03:51.189> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
actually painted the outside of the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.759 
actually painted the outside of the
barrel<00:03:51.400> mainly<00:03:51.849> just<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.150> keep<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
barrel mainly just to keep the

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.229 
barrel mainly just to keep the
temperature<00:03:54.250> cooler<00:03:54.519> because<00:03:54.790> obviously<00:03:55.209> a

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
temperature cooler because obviously a

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.059 
temperature cooler because obviously a
blue<00:03:55.449> barrel<00:03:55.659> is<00:03:55.959> going<00:03:56.259> to<00:03:56.379> attract<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.829> lot<00:03:56.979> of

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
blue barrel is going to attract a lot of

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.530 
blue barrel is going to attract a lot of
heat<00:03:57.900> whereas<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.109> this<00:03:59.470> creamy<00:03:59.799> color<00:04:00.129> is

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
heat whereas the this creamy color is

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.490 
heat whereas the this creamy color is
certainly<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.689> to<00:04:01.750> reflect<00:04:02.079> more<00:04:02.259> of<00:04:02.319> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
certainly going to reflect more of the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.189 
certainly going to reflect more of the
heat<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.889> not<00:04:03.750> obviously<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.780> live<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.079> hot

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
heat and not obviously I live in a hot

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.009 
heat and not obviously I live in a hot
climate<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.799> that's<00:04:05.949> important<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:07.329> also<00:04:07.689> need

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
climate so that's important I also need

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.830 
climate so that's important I also need
to<00:04:08.049> I<00:04:08.650> need<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.430> paint<00:04:09.699> all<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> these<00:04:10.359> legs<00:04:10.599> off

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
to I need to paint all of these legs off

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
I sort of ran out of paint while I was

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
so I can finish painting that and that's

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.509 
so I can finish painting that and that's
about<00:04:21.219> it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.470 
I need to
get<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> piece<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.160> plywood<00:04:27.400> for<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:27.940> top<00:04:28.270> and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
get a piece of plywood for the top and

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.320 
get a piece of plywood for the top and
then<00:04:29.290> I'll<00:04:29.890> obviously<00:04:30.280> put<00:04:30.520> some<00:04:30.760> some<00:04:31.120> sort

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
then I'll obviously put some some sort

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.540 
then I'll obviously put some some sort
of<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.450> protective<00:04:31.960> layer<00:04:31.990> probably<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:33.280> core

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
of a protective layer probably that core

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.060 
of a protective layer probably that core
flute<00:04:33.820> sign<00:04:34.360> plastic<00:04:35.050> corrugated<00:04:35.890> plastic

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
flute sign plastic corrugated plastic

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.840 
flute sign plastic corrugated plastic
will<00:04:37.000> probably<00:04:37.270> go<00:04:37.360> on<00:04:37.480> top<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.870> plywood

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
will probably go on top of the plywood

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.540 
will probably go on top of the plywood
and<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.830> that's<00:04:41.980> about<00:04:42.100> it

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and so that's about it

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.920 
and so that's about it
just<00:04:43.030> wanted<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.300> give<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.450> that<00:04:43.600> update<00:04:43.720> and

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
just wanted to give you that update and

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.840 
just wanted to give you that update and
the<00:04:44.740> next<00:04:44.950> update<00:04:45.100> I'll<00:04:45.370> give<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.580> on<00:04:45.670> these

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
the next update I'll give you on these

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.540 
the next update I'll give you on these
will<00:04:46.090> probably<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:47.010> with<00:04:48.010> them<00:04:48.190> completely

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
will probably be with them completely

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.940 
will probably be with them completely
finished
