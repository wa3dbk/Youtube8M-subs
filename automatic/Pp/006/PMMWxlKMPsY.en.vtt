00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello, we already know a little about 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.080
 degrees for example we know what if 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.380
 raise number 4 to the third degree is 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.240
 same as take three fours and 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.389
 multiply them you can also start with 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.210
 units and multiply it by 43 times 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.080
 as if we did not record a 4 in a cube 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 equal to 4 multiply by 4 this is 16 16 multiply 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.260
 at 4 it is 64 also we already know something 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.289
 about negative exponents 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.840
 for example 4 to minus 3 degrees 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.270
 we know that this minus indicator 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 degrees indicates what we need 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.180
 take the reciprocal of this number but 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.370
 already with a positive exponent 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 4 cubed is 64 then it is equal to 1 64 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 now let's consider fractional 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.480
 the exponent is 4 in 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.820
 degrees 1 2 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 I advise you to stop the video and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.809
 think about what it should be like 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.619
 definition 4 in degree 1 2 is the root 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.600
 square of 4 and why is this so 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.729
 what this follows from the basic properties 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 degrees and do not contradict them 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.310
 and what is the square root of 4 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.409
 to answer this question we need 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.470
 find the number which when multiplying itself 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.439
 on yourself tass 4 what number multiplied 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 self equal to 4 of course it's two 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 and to better understand this post we 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.759
 also write down that 4 equals 2 squared and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.320
 we see an interesting picture 4 to the extent 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.540
 1 2 this is 2 by 2 squared this is 4 let's 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.060
 let's solve some more examples so that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.189
 practice to understand everything and I advise 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.610
 you stop the video and try 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.869
 independently find solutions 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.960
 based on what i just 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.200
 recorded what do you think is equal to 9 in 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.430
 degrees 1 2 this is equal to the square root 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.460
 of 9 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.719
 and this is equal to 3 so we can say 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.069
 that 9 is 3 squared both of these records 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.200
 fair let's continue what is 25 in 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.200
 degrees 1 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.440
 the second is five or we can 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.470
 write down that 25 is 5 squared 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.970
 and now look at how to build the numbers in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.150
 degree 1 3 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.120
 let's try to build 8 to degree 1 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.970
 3 by definition raise the number to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.130
 degree 1 3 is the same as taking 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.670
 root of the third degree of this number 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.049
 Cubic root of 8 is the number that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.879
 multiplying by itself 3 times gives 8 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.299
 something multiplied by something multiplied by 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.390
 something equal to 8 we already know that 8 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.720
 This is 2 in the cube, which means the root of the third 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.630
 degrees from 8 or 8 to degree 1 3 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.819
 equals two this root is equal to the number 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.239
 which you need to multiply by itself 3 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.420
 times to get 8 and that's two because 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.260
 that 2 in the cube is 8 let's do more 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.110
 several tasks what is 64 in 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.769
 degree 1/3 multiply by 4 multiply by 4 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:24.799
 this 64 means this expression should 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:27.170
 equals 4 write down that 64 is 4 cubed and i 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.459
 I think you have already noticed the connection between these 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.400
 degree indicators 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.130
 let's do another task we already 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.569
 with a different exponent what is 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.579
 32 in degree 1 5 this is equal to the number that 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.780
 need to multiply by itself five times 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.720
 to get 32 and this is the same as 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.660
 and 2 multiply by 2 multiply by 2 multiply 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.120
 by 2 times 22 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.560
 This is the number that needs to be multiplied. 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.459
 on yourself five times to get 32 ​​32 in 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.630
 degrees 1 5 is two or can say 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.200
 what 32 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.980
 this is 2 to the fifth degree on this all up 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.980
 see you soon
