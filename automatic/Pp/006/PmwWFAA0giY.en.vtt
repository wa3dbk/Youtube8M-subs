00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.680
 so Regitz had in the test and estimates 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.680
 Placing CLS a scandal in March 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.410
 so the thing is the wildlife Siddique said Martin Falch percent that is one 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.880
 LEDs themselves and that Fischer looks like promised 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.029
 following to the poor hands 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.159
 creates possibilities 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.769
 the man was the power plug for electricity 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.699
 In addition, vernacular shrank several 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 the older man different than usual 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.089
 all at once have the plug five us-account first five beefy the XK 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.440
 then the 3 policy in Exten three policeman the mix 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.540
 and the display +4 buttons to the start of Namics and so on 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.190
 then they drive plan 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.410
 cleaner 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.830
 the device has 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.760
 I have a total of 400 32 EEG Brack after the time 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.250
 In any case, you may crown a photo Native Game out of 44 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.990
 then that does not hear any words that allow 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.170
 Lights like that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.560
 a week after that it means lights 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 You do not have to program big but the man over him 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 six channels to sperm later 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.430
 six long run 8 percent 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.940
 and then you can not excite the first channel all of them either 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.300
 and then that has loads in the masters and taxes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.300
 many answers you can do it all 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.600
 then not on the DAX 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.690
 also via the foot controller taxes 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.690
 around 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 or just everywhere music built-in microphone 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.480
 I'll come 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.520
 continuing to increase 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.220
 around 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.070
 I already said it has 6 you can set different channels 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.510
 Steinmeier would control six channels 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.120
 Anna over 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.760
 the new channels at one over the principles removed 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 You can also set the whole thing here 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.610
 yes, I would not have objected to DAX, for example 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 Men were traveling all the streets 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.840
 because you are not not part of the community either other options 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.129
 Unfortunately not 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.309
 yes and around 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.309
 which track Martin will come next 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 to Greece lie 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.959
 we have 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
 also Jena 1 as I said the whole 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.559
 Run lights and at first 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.049
 Kerstan received 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.049
 because Lucas family the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.749
 that just so the colors 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.229
 is incidentally 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.889
 it offered 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.260
 that's three and two 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.889
 a 3 4 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.449
 7 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.939
 seven colors 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
 supposedly in the barrel lights 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.679
 for example, for the market have networks 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.839
 The blue spruce Richards will soon make a minimum height of 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.879
 such must not have made 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.459
 so many different 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.689
 he has nobody to me 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.149
 Mel written by Hilti OK 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.599
 Witten image stroke features like that works 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.079
 at the third excited 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.079
 you had the strokes functions 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.649
 and you can then with each color with each run not with one eighth 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.559
 what you did 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.639
 So that's an extra 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.419
 Wegner 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.699
 and before k2 you can say the speed 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.239
 who does not agree 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.939
 more vary 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.329
 and 4 5 6 are there to select colors 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.439
 So at 4 you blind out Roth at 5 while you green out 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.129
 at 6 not exactly 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.459
 but sometimes admission no longer 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.849
 there can be a rectory 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.119
 and 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.870
 that's it with the x 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.219
 to offer it 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.150
 So he wants to say um 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.020
 if you turn it on now and on 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.169
 around 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.490
 and you want to transfer it over 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.360
 Monz only makes the two knights court 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 the whole thing runs over automatically 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.580
 Music is the microphone 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.020
 and if you are more of a quick old one now 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.809
 never before are Gronemann microphone 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.770
 not that they seem to get the deal more and more and they come or not 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.770
 So spend 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.849
 what was Shawn the 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.349
 Kleinert's first estimates 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.340
 Platinum Zeller 1 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.099
 yes and that's saying speak 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.240
 when the thing is light
