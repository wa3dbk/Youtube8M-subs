but<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.430> cool<00:04:23.640> he<00:04:24.090> goes<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.570> rain<00:04:24.780> dance<00:04:24.990> I'm

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
but so cool he goes for a rain dance I'm

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.730 
but so cool he goes for a rain dance I'm
not<00:04:25.530> really<00:04:25.920> too<00:04:26.340> worried<00:04:26.760> about<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.750> mean<00:04:28.530> it

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
not really too worried about I mean it

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.040 
not really too worried about I mean it
makes<00:04:28.980> my<00:04:29.250> already<00:04:29.910> know<00:04:30.210> garnet<00:04:30.540> hurricanes

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
makes my already know garnet hurricanes

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.020 
makes my already know garnet hurricanes
even<00:04:31.770> more<00:04:31.980> accurate<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.700> for<00:04:32.850> some<00:04:33.000> reason

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
even more accurate and for some reason

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.300 
even more accurate and for some reason
nobody<00:04:33.390> have<00:04:33.690> taken<00:04:33.900> away<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.710> that's<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:35.070> cool

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
nobody have taken away so that's a cool

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.250 
nobody have taken away so that's a cool
little<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:36.000> percent<00:04:36.510> chance<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.930> happen

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
little one percent chance to happen

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.840
