obviously have to know how to do fakie
flip<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.340> then<00:00:37.129> maybe<00:00:38.129> even<00:00:38.309> learn<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.910> maybe

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
flip and then maybe even learn not maybe

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.670 
flip and then maybe even learn not maybe
but<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> gotta<00:00:39.840> learn<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.290> shifty

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but you gotta learn how to do shifty

but you gotta learn how to do shifty
always<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.610> backwards<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> key

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
always going backwards and then the key

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.930 
always going backwards and then the key
to<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> trick<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> pretend<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> you're

basically doing like a frontside half
cab<00:00:49.230> clip<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> catch<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.719> like

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
cab clip and then you catch it like

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.459 
cab clip and then you catch it like
about<00:00:52.110> 90<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:52.980> bring<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.460> back

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
about 90 and then bring the right back

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.410 
about 90 and then bring the right back
turn<00:00:55.469> those<00:00:55.620> shoulders<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:57.300> away

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
turn those shoulders and right away

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.490

clean

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.820 

so<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:04.220> set<00:01:04.400> up<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.760> fakie<00:01:04.970> shifty<00:01:05.449> flips

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
so to set up on the fakie shifty flips

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.780 
so to set up on the fakie shifty flips
you<00:01:06.830> want<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.040> basically<00:01:07.280> pretend<00:01:07.729> that
