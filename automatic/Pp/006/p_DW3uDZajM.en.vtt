slightly<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:12.489> pretty<00:03:12.760> sharp<00:03:13.120> like

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040

slightly and it is pretty sharp like
yeah<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.959> not<00:03:17.170> razor<00:03:17.830> sharp<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.640> knives

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940

would<00:03:19.600> really<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:21.340> still<00:03:21.519> cut

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
would really be but it can still cut

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.350 
would really be but it can still cut
paper<00:03:22.569> up<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> point<00:03:24.120> because<00:03:25.120> there's<00:03:25.299> a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
paper up to a point because there's a

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.780 
paper up to a point because there's a
little<00:03:25.540> protective<00:03:25.989> film<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.530> there<00:03:26.769> so<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
little protective film on there so it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.789 
little protective film on there so it
catches<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:29.860> very<00:03:30.489> sharp<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:32.110> pombal<00:03:32.650> is

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799
