00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.120
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:10.550
 Shiozawa of craftsman airbrush craftsman from Woody to Yamanashi 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.550
 I will finally draw the engine room on the bonnet 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.910
 The engine room has various parts such as metal and plastic rubber 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.330
 While expressing different textures up to the small part 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.330
 The point is to give a three-dimensional effect on the flat bonnet 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.559
 me 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.070
 We interviewed the figure drawn by Mr. Shiozo and look 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.500
 I noticed that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.960
 Do not use the road even when it is not get straight 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.700
 Old impression at any time 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.700
 It was a commitment of Shiozenzan 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.050
 Alpha Nde this is going in the same exactly come not products 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.050
 Yeah I Is not it nice Attach them there was a point dad 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
 When did you know? 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.610
 Oiso 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.070
 Though it is number 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.060
 Not a straight line including a straight line such Fu to type the hate in Yogu bran at hand 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.619
 Let's go there automatically 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.619
 The feeling that I wrote in the form comes out 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.119
 Stick to handwriting 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.149
 The reason was Shiozawa 's main business 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.149
 Hmm 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:30.350
 Actually airbrush craftsman is originally a signboard craftsman 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.700
 Signboards that used to be handwritten in the old days are now printed on PC designs and spring work 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.700
 Almost 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.240
 It has become a world that can not be said to be a craftsman 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.009
 Hmm 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.009
 Mr. Shiozawa was a craftsman who originally made precise signs by handwriting 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.910
 The subject of the signboard shown to the customers is already the level of art 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:03.810
 This I banged wish you below and fog pom-pom tier sets and of course 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 But I did not think the kind I have been to this kind of child coat Village 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.380
 I can not do this anymore 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.300
 I wonder if there are no after-effects and no one will tell you 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.530
 I Beam is also prime even now 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.430
 Say 90 more times 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.290
 The work can also be in the first 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:29.290
 But it is not boring work 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:34.120
 Quite enjoy when part because the people of Higashigoro is as the mushroom there is still Well tongue time 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 I think about it now in the age of digitalization now and again I will come out more and more 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.960
 but 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.050
 I wonder if it 's okay or I'm probably getting bored 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.480
 I'm getting bored soon 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.600
 So it's changing more and more 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.170
 I do not get tired of this 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.170
 I will not dawn 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:02.909
 I want to make use of my arm I have polished as a signboard maker 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.909
 That's why I started airbrushing five years ago 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.069
 Yam soup 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.680
 It's a bit far from birth 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.470
 That's amazing! 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.160
 2 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.160
 Good enough to lose words at the drafting stage 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.220
 Mr. Shiozawa who keeps blowing for more than 12 hours a day 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.220
 Tired has been accumulated 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.570
 Ne of Hey depth of trouble was the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.740
 Same sound as an overall sound closer 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.880
 Such a defeat of defeat 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.169
 It is that maybe this such Toko is a before and Dawn because there is a code 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.639
 Not be in front of people at the top 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:39.460
 Even if it grows up, there is something in it at all. 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.910
 Ika by changing the place just in case Wakan or've done if it did say bedding with you much a pretty delicate 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.560
 If not 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.560
 Well maybe these so called by cases 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.540
 Or all of them 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.810
 I think 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.810
 Follow 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.480
 The coloring is over 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:05.150
 Next is drawing the face of this work 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150
 Hmm 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
 Hmm 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:25.630
 When you let go of it , the characters came up nicely 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:31.080
 Technique but from here craftsmen 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.080
 I will move around the character to make it familiar with the background 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.200
 Undecided doing you were a woman I 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.660
 I stuck it 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.820
 It became a pool bag 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.820
 Cocotte I already visible beer kana 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:51.889
 The almost finished final finish is now reserved for demonstrations in the showroom 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.990
 But perhaps unpleasant'm so much a character as expected 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:08.199
 I can not see it at all in the patient 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.199
 There'll it A'a' not listening distribution 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:19.320
 The hut of not attached parentheses people of the fan guard 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.320
 Do not think from it to become Is it okay with if there are this later plucked out the day we house 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.620
 It's reaction is busy from 6 to get by yourself 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.689
 I can not make a mummy 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.720
 In the still heat-san who has hatch 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:36.380
 I want to like it Oh yes it's the best 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.380
 Turn off with it 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.840
 Ten nabe neck meat rotors completed or came home 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:46.050
 That Nde does not matter 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:51.650
 Three Well of course Ippanashi also matter in the driver queuing fall asleep 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.650
 You can't do much with this customer 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.169
 It will be good if you stick new car 1 series in the hope 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.600
 Skills of craftsmen pass through in the showroom
