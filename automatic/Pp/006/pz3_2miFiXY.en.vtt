yet<00:00:10.980> again<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.120> like<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.540> five

yet again this is like the five

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.099 
yet again this is like the five
hundredth<00:00:13.320> time<00:00:13.440> we've<00:00:13.769> traded<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:15.109> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
hundredth time we've traded and the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.019 
hundredth time we've traded and the
reason<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:16.770> she's<00:00:17.670> such<00:00:18.000> a

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
reason for that is because she's such a

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.630 
reason for that is because she's such a
nice<00:00:18.300> person<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.100> we<00:00:20.100> talked<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> lot<00:00:20.580> over

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000 
nice person and we talked a lot over
email<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.570> we've<00:00:22.350> become<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.680> good

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
email so we've become really good

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.759 
email so we've become really good
friends<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
friends and so we do have a lot of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.550 
friends and so we do have a lot of
trades<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.310> everything<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:28.410> got

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
trades and everything so I've got

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
trades and everything so I've got
another<00:00:28.980> trade<00:00:29.369> package<00:00:29.699> from<00:00:30.000> her<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.449> now

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
another trade package from her just now

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.819 
another trade package from her just now
and<00:00:31.189> as<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:35.780> this<00:00:36.780> isn't<00:00:37.050> exactly<00:00:37.170> my

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and as you can see this isn't exactly my

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.299 
and as you can see this isn't exactly my
filming<00:00:38.760> area<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:40.320> reason<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
filming area and the reason for that is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
filming area and the reason for that is
because<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:43.969> was<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.120> ready<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.170> package

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
because I was not ready for this package

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
because I was not ready for this package
like<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.739> didn't<00:00:46.950> realize<00:00:47.219> when<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.059> coming

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
like I didn't realize when he was coming

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
like I didn't realize when he was coming
so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> didn't<00:00:48.660> realize<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.050> coming<00:00:49.260> today<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
so I didn't realize it's coming today so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.439 
so I didn't realize it's coming today so
my<00:00:50.039> filming<00:00:50.340> area<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.730> completely<00:00:51.120> like
