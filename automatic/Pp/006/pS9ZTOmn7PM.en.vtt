00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.160
 a look at the slopes on the tail now in Thalkirchdorf shows that the 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.430
 German Skicross Series is anything but easy even if the weather is not 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.779
 played as solid as that runners do not depend on the state 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.989
 while the organizers still communicate by radio and the last ones 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.660
 Details discuss the girls and boys were traveling 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.820
 the mood is need covered I was he then apply right now 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 was even felt felt 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 we as the church and monastery FÃ¼rstenfeld for the race itself have the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.040
 Participants, of course, something made 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.010
 dpa we have as a partner 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.990
 and puts here opened Top 16 of the 50 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.650
 It's just going to be fun even liter and more because I do not 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.250
 such big goals 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.090
 then the first runner gets ready to go down for it 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.790
 she and all other participants on a distance of 770 meters 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.620
 while a height difference of almost 200 meters is overcome at the first 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.680
 Run start all participants individually here is the time the drivers 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680
 on the not very easy route 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.890
 This includes several obstacles that make Ski Cross something special 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.600
 that practically two elements come together on the one hand Faerber 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.190
 first individual time trial that she will for this strain 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.140
 and that second and four times against each other and not very many 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.850
 Jumps steel and curves and waves before must be clear 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.600
 challenging slope 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.520
 after saving the best is 8 yards and the fastest 32 guys 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 firmly 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.450
 These have already arrived back at the start area 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.250
 now it's all or nothing everyone wants the track as fast as possible 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.910
 Going down boards an ePass wants with not only the participants but also 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.320
 the organizers had to fight 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.130
 that then but he would still have been in Ronny k Cup giving the us market a worry due to the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.479
 early snowfall and storms 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.110
 Unfortunately today a little softer track will be harder then I have the same 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.260
 Conditions for all runners the same way there's one or the other 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.710
 before he wants but it goes to 4 in groups of four start the runners now 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 the breaks mean that the first two places in the next 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.429
 Round up 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.299
 This is repeated until the four finalists in the girls and 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.839
 Young boy standing firmly 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.529
 in the last runners then shows clearly more ahead 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.329
 but no matter who in the end is the least or not 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.249
 the next race still comes first
