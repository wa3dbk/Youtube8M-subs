maybe a low-grade of version of permit x
John<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.629> our<00:00:49.550> low<00:00:50.550> strength

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
John what we have is our low strength

get vibration in that if it's a little

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
get vibration in that if it's a little
bit<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> alignment<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> start

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
threads can little by little back off

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.700 
threads can little by little back off
and<00:01:23.700> once<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.540> does<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.259> things<00:01:25.439> come

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to have to heat this up to above 450

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.990 
to have to heat this up to above 450
degrees<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.470> take<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.340> apart<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.849> that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
degrees and take it apart at that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.819 
degrees and take it apart at that
elevated<00:02:30.450> temperature<00:02:31.140> awesome<00:02:31.650> no<00:02:31.799> doubt

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
elevated temperature awesome no doubt

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.300 
elevated temperature awesome no doubt
now<00:02:32.579> what<00:02:32.909> is<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> actual<00:02:33.690> material<00:02:34.319> this<00:02:35.129> is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
now what is the actual material this is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.789 
now what is the actual material this is
an<00:02:35.400> anaerobic<00:02:35.909> material<00:02:36.690> okay<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.739> to

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
an anaerobic material okay and I want to

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.649 
an anaerobic material okay and I want to
talk<00:02:37.890> about<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.129> anaerobic<00:02:38.909> means<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
talk about that anaerobic means that it

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.780 
talk about that anaerobic means that it
cures<00:02:39.900> without<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.739> presence<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.250> air<00:02:41.579> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
cures without the presence of air and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.149 
cures without the presence of air and
there<00:02:42.239> needs<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.569> be<00:02:42.599> metal<00:02:43.049> contact<00:02:43.560> right

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
there needs to be metal contact right

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.490 
there needs to be metal contact right
okay<00:02:44.519> now<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.360> means<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.140> don't<00:02:46.290> want<00:02:46.319> to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
okay now that means you don't want to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.400 
okay now that means you don't want to
use<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.280> plastic<00:02:48.209> okay<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
use it in that and plastic okay if you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
use it in that and plastic okay if you
use<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.890> plastic<00:02:50.069> it's<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.670> shatter

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
use it in plastic it's going to shatter

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.720 
use it in plastic it's going to shatter
just<00:02:51.599> like<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.049> okay<00:02:52.769> don't<00:02:53.160> don't<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.579> that
