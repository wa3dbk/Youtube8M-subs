00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.340
 It is Sakurai that has been newly made, but it was blackberry 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.109
 I would like to think about Japan's disruptive environment 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.039
 That's why 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.489
 Please add 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.369
 A site for trading between companies in 23 minutes of corporate government agencies 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.960
 I'm working on this flight 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.189
 It is said that Yon is steadily advancing 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.039
 Both will look like they correspond to this graph 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.579
 It was next month 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.400
 Kohei Kawasaki 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.770
 Single answer 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.490
 It is strong so far and is adopted and server setting 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.110
 It is possible to hear the server's conservative advantage 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.249
 I can get it, but 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.399
 In the case of plum, there is a cloud service provider 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.129
 Military serviceability low cost for san switch server 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.070
 There is a fact that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 Another one is the terminal side 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.220
 Because we are in the soil 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.650
 Is gone 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.540
 I wanted to base it on the data of or 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.530
 The club's first solo exhibition, so by entering into the agreement again 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.210
 Come through to keep 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 I'm sorry 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.290
 The end of the meeting is here 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.260
 Due to this, companies of group executives are often used 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.090
 But 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.660
 I am improving Microsoft exchangeibm lotusdomino 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 You can trust yourself 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.990
 Race or name wrestler 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 You can use this old temple even with blackberry 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.310
 Register a schedule from the terminal 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.130
 If you add it to your favorite car, it will be the same with your company's PC 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 The schedule has been registered or corrected 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.950
 The dance is called employee education in a company 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890
 I think there is a keyword 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.380
 I was specializing in the sales evaluation of another school 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.990
 I think there is a school education but 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.509
 Thinking that it comes out utilizing smartphones 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.509
 I thought I could 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.050
 Essayist 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.110

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.520
 I will introduce you 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.390
 My own ongoing 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.010
 It is the company's claim 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.010
 When a product or service new employee was in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.139
 Not a pre-business type that teaches 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.059
 Where the end has been broken 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.529
 There is one point that we can learn in the gap time of opening time 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.839
 The other is 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.139
 Start all the topic species 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.699
 If a person ends by creating one content 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 Can get sick 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.960
 Even during the examination 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.909
 Can be provided here 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:32.780
 It's a lie 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.319
 In gap time, we can learn in four hours of travel time of train 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.049
 it can 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.799
 PC or something 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.739
 An article that you can learn without carrying heavy things 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.419
 Again 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.199
 I think it is easier to use
