where<00:00:00.299> were<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:00.599> on<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.840> night<00:00:00.870> of<00:00:00.989> July<00:00:01.199> 27th

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
where were you on the night of July 27th

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.660 
where were you on the night of July 27th
mm-hmm<00:00:03.929> turns<00:00:04.470> out<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.040> very<00:00:05.279> act<00:00:05.490> of

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
mm-hmm turns out the very act of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.240 
mm-hmm turns out the very act of
remembering<00:00:06.210> might<00:00:06.690> make<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.109> forget<00:00:07.529> and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
remembering might make you forget and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.930 
remembering might make you forget and
that's<00:00:08.400> not<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.670> bad<00:00:08.910> thing<00:00:13.490> hey<00:00:14.490> guys<00:00:14.670> Julia

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
that's not a bad thing hey guys Julia

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.120 
that's not a bad thing hey guys Julia
here<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.269> dnews<00:00:15.680> scientists<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.770> known<00:00:16.920> for

here for dnews scientists have known for
a<00:00:17.160> while<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.550> humans<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.119> terrible

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
a while that humans have terrible

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080 
a while that humans have terrible
memories<00:00:18.900> memories<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:20.279> change<00:00:20.550> over<00:00:20.850> time

memories memories can change over time

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
memories memories can change over time
and<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.480> even<00:00:21.930> remember<00:00:22.170> things<00:00:22.560> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and we can even remember things that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
and we can even remember things that
never<00:00:22.949> happened<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.939> talked<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> bunch<00:00:24.480> about

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
never happened we talked a bunch about

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.240 
never happened we talked a bunch about

so<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.590> memory<00:00:28.920> sucks<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.609> science

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
so we know memory sucks but science

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.580 
so we know memory sucks but science
hasn't<00:00:30.060> been<00:00:30.300> sure<00:00:30.510> why<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.869> forget<00:00:31.199> things<00:00:31.410> at

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
hasn't been sure why we forget things at

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
hasn't been sure why we forget things at
all<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> passive<00:00:32.759> thing<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.210> just

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
all it's at a passive thing that just

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.150 
all it's at a passive thing that just
happens<00:00:33.870> well<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.559> turns<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
happens well it turns out that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.340 
happens well it turns out that
forgetting<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> pretty<00:00:36.270> active<00:00:36.809> process

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
forgetting is a pretty active process

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
forgetting is a pretty active process
your<00:00:37.739> brain<00:00:37.950> does<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.460> purpose<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.300> a

initially<00:00:56.520> fired<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.910> -<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.020> they

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
initially fired up - but then they

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.959 
initially fired up - but then they
became<00:00:58.469> suppressed<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.670> might<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
became suppressed and that might be a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
became suppressed and that might be a
good<00:01:00.270> thing<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.780> mean<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> talk

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
good thing I mean that way when I talk

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
good thing I mean that way when I talk
about<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.000> example<00:01:03.090> China<00:01:03.690> from<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
about you know for example China from a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
about you know for example China from a
dinner<00:01:04.170> party<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.040> don't<00:01:05.220> immediately<00:01:05.610> think

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
dinner party you don't immediately think

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149 
dinner party you don't immediately think
of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.299> country<00:01:06.900> China<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.619> researchers

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
of the country China the researchers

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.530 
of the country China the researchers
think<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> maybe<00:01:08.670> these<00:01:08.880> new<00:01:09.090> findings

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
think that maybe these new findings

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.390 
think that maybe these new findings
might<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.869> incredibly<00:01:10.409> useful<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:11.159> trying

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
might be incredibly useful when trying

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.130 
might be incredibly useful when trying
to<00:01:11.520> overcome<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> negative<00:01:12.450> memory<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:12.990> our

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to overcome a negative memory from our

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
to overcome a negative memory from our
past<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.860> forgetting<00:01:14.460> might<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> good<00:01:15.119> thing

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
past so forgetting might be a good thing

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
past so forgetting might be a good thing
it<00:01:15.630> actually<00:01:15.810> might<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.350> us<00:01:16.500> remember<00:01:16.680> other

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it actually might make us remember other

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
it actually might make us remember other
memories<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.180> how<00:01:18.450> does<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.780> happen<00:01:19.080> what's
