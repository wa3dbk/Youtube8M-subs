00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.910
 you people it's 50 91 Thursday I hope 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.990
 that you're still young at 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.610
 center years for a new review on 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.960
 the chain 7 of his majesty robin van 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.180
 so persie the Dutch scorer of 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.830
 manchester united that I had in the 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.210
 packs for those who will complain 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.130
 yeah but it's a day not at all 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.170
 accessible I totally agree 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.689
 with that for the beginning you do a kind 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.609
 rather complicated to have but in the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.900
 comments from the UFO pack a lot of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.910
 people have asked me even on the networks 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.520
 social we came spam in asia steuplÃ© 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.809
 on the review so the voice if you have 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.430
 these in-game stats that are in the process of 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.960
 scroll down to pause or 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.890
 put back at the team level 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.260
 you could see that I stall them in 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.460
 a battery the first league 1 3 5 2 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.140
 a device 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.879
 offensively it's good but 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.890
 defensively it's really very 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.020
 complicated to manage and I still have not 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.190
 bad galley with this team so at 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.719
 price level of robin van persie 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.289
 what can we say ben ali se 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.480
 somewhere between 65 and 70 miles credit I 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.489
 sold mine 69,000 credit just after 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.620
 the frozen magazine sold directly to 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.450
 prices went down after they re 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.100
 then increase the market is 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.500
 completely crazy in addition there are 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.850
 the web application that's dead in the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 sense where the transfer market on 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.650
 the web application is impossible so in 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.210
 this moment level market prices it's 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.080
 a little anything 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.150
 that's why I give a 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.280
 fork enough how to say a 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.790
 fairly rough range ya ten 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.260
 miles apart 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.240
 this is at the level of the negative points 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.470
 now from robin van persie so the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 speed I decided to put it in 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 the negatives it's true that I have 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.860
 tested players rather long up 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.300
 present gomez gignac gignac on the map 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.280
 it has exactly the same speed as 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.270
 robin van persie but I do not know the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.130
 robin van persie I found them 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.440
 much heavier than gignac and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.400
 I wanted to make it clear from below 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.810
 in the negative points 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.850
 then in the other two points 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.040
 negatives his stats in jump i'm going 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.110
 put back 87 but it's true that low of 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.120
 balloons of the head if he takes it but he 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.650
 takes a lot less than others 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.690
 players what and that this attention is 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.180
 relatively weak there are only 59 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.040
 years at and on that it's stats in 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.870
 balance 59 in equilibrium like it is 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.730
 really makes you move very very 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.590
 easily at the shoulder of a 72 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.000
 in strength and it does not necessarily compensate 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.810
 say it will be sometimes I love them but I 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.320
 did not even put them in the points 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 positive 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.780
 so it's true that at the level of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.100
 the shoulder it really is difficult to hold 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.810
 on his legs we now go to 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.950
 positive point of robin van persie because 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.350
 that it's the only three points 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.610
 negatives that I found so at the level 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.930
 positive points now is there 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.390
 really much already technically 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 first day 4 stars that I test it 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.940
 a little fun to play with 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.850
 like 4 stars technical gestures 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.350
 so he at 1.84 in dribbling m combined with 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.750
 its four stars in technical gestures 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.220
 it's really very very interesting 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.500
 you can have fun what 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.110
 technically the stop enter the scoop 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.880
 turn at the stop of the ronaldo shock of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.250
 gestures that rightly takes you out of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.630
 rather tricky situation after at 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.459
 level set pieces so 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.709
 already penalties 1.86 his penalty the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.940
 pulls really very very well and the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.480
 free kicks you could see that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.550
 I had one 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.050
 I could not put it that changes 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.220
 not from one fifa to another I always 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.450
 as much harm but at the level of francs 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.160
 even though apparently it's a lot more 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.810
 easy on that choice here I typed the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.239
 So it was going pretty well post it 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.120
 81 years combined free-throw accuracy 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.250
 its 90 in hitting power and 186 in 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.390
 effect this is the ball share very very 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.440
 of course the only free kick you 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 you could see that it could have purpose 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.370
 unfortunately I hit the post but 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.930
 we were on track for the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.400
 free kicks then at the level of the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.709
 finish because it's a bit the thing 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
 the most interesting for a scorer 91 in 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.489
 finish in front of the cages it really 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.269
 excellent so the flat foot typing 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.950
 in strength 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.180
 the little dive the bad 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.799
 raise the guard I'm going to kill I 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.989
 not even hesitate about languages 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.269
 shot he at 1 86 years old shock announcement I you 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.860
 said his punching power 90 the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.420
 balloons leave really very very well 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.880
 and that's nice 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.049
 where the van persie is very interesting 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.560
 it is at the level of his pass quality 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.989
 he 1.82 in vision and 1.82 we pass on 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.040
 the map you can even frankly 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.510
 you can play it in one word 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.950
 there will be no problem on that side 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.680
 since it's really very complete 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.030
 especially in his quality of passing me 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.230
 I made some assists I 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.000
 did not do a lot because that and 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.380
 I play them more as a scorer but 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.630
 on all the openings I made 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.519
 with him usually the ball went off 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.870
 really very very well that's a big 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.130
 positive point for an attacker this is 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.320
 Ca argeles issued with a second 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.910
 attacking a rather fast diouf 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.250
 precisely there was a player rather 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.560
 slow for who has a good quality of 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.660
 go by and sweet next to it so that can 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 to be the right combination to use 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.180
 van persie there is already the last clip 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.130
 at the positioning level 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.530
 he is always well placed 90 years 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.389
 similar positioning 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.800
 as the gomez gignac is people 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.990
 really very easy to find on the 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.460
 field and that's very interesting at 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.800
 ball control level 87 years 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.720
 control the balloons ben voila you him 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.220
 put a balloon either and by a 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.740
 center of balloons a little foolish 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.230
 general although here is the center ratp y 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.910
 has missed its quality at the 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.410
 ball control usually we go 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.570
 to make a difference and that's a big 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.520
 positive point and finally the 4 stars 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.630
 bad foot he has both feet that 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.710
 it's perfect for a southpaw 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.570
 usually left-handed are that the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.850
 left foot there he has the right foot too 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.230
 so that's pretty interesting it was 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.060
 last clip of robin van persie you 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.220
 so have the balance sheet that is displayed 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.450
 in front of your eyes so the best rating 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.740
 for the moment at the income level 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.190
 still not guessing but a very very 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.720
 good mark 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.740
 so at the level of the positive points the 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.600
 set pieces of kicks as I said 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.610
 free kicks and the penaltys he can 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.130
 shoot both without problems and done 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.510
 fly vision of the game 82 years vision it's 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.590
 really very interesting three scorers 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.330
 his agility 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.320
 I forgot to talk about it but how 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.669
 which he turns around and so on 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.460
 technically it's very very 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.990
 interesting finish 81 dribble finish 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.340
 technically very interesting 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.300
 ball checks as I told you 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.330
 you can put him balloons a 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.130
 little bit crappy he will and will control without 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.810
 problem the shock the ball goes very 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.950
 very sure of the far-off strikes 4 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.210
 bad foot star he has both feet 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.979
 positioning always well placed 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.300
 pass quality this is one of the most 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.740
 big plus point of robin van persie 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.300
 and that his star in finish is really 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.130
 very very complete is only a very beautiful 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.669
 technical gesture and its power of 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.870
 hit 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.200
 then at the negative points 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.370
 sow who is down he has a dirty relax 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.080
 like really putting him the ball on 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.280
 the head if you hope that marks a 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.080
 purpose after the clarifications maybe 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.930
 rather ok I did not talk about it but he 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.330
 1.73 precision precision precision head 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.930
 so there's way to do some stuff 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.030
 interesting 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.979
 if you put the ball on your head 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.060
 his speed me that posed me problem 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.410
 in certain situations are 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.539
 phases of against including he got 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.740
 catch up pretty easily problem that 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.740
 I did not necessarily have a gignac 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.410
 or a mario gomez and it gets drunk in 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.479
 balance hylas 1 72 in strength 1 59 in 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.460
 balance physically he gets moved 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.289
 still quite often but it did not 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.780
 stopped in seven games of 14 goals with 14 goals 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.260
 and make two assists which 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.180
 it needs a 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.620
 which earned him a 19 out of 20 certainly he has 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.030
 a balance sheet may be worse than 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.470
 gignac or a scrub less true anymore 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.350
 the baker is awesome I think he 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.630
 fed up 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.460
 much worse than gomez but in the 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.930
 game it weighs a lot more because mario 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.880
 gomez and it's for me the best 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.620
 player I tested now that's it 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.240
 so a 19 out of 20 for robin van persie 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.550
 that's it was bland media found in hd 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.920
 I hope this first big 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.270

 this fifa i totally rage the geek goals 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.910

 take out a little compilation of goals 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.050

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.310
