00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello everyone and welcome to break today's 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.040
 the video to the name will be executed 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 dedicated to empty jars and so that 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.110
 take your time let's get started 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.810
 the first thing that comes to hand 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.510
 This dry shampoo and from the company a couple of weeks 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.670
 I do not know, I do not care for what I want to say 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.449
 disgusting thing terrible 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.550
 the fragrance is simple and the shampoo is on its own 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.350
 horrible and awful 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.630
 I do not recommend dry shampoos which are not even 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.410
 ended this Norwegian 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:45.340
 Norwegian brand define such here 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.430
 dry shampoo makes me sound strange 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.350
 I don’t like him absolutely either 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.000
 very bad smell me start right 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.090
 rock this shampoo 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.510
 to use it too, can not, and the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.680
 Probably half still do not know me 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 familiar they use I don't like 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.710
 further ended in my balm mask 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.390
 for hair from giving intent 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.720
 what can I say to dislike 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.799
 I finished it already for brushes 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 used it here it is very hard for me 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.020
 hair is therefore not hair greasy 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.439
 not why 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.679
 could not them and then than toothpaste 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.630
 which squeezed out just further 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.579
 nowhere 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.850
 this toothpaste could be seen already in 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.649
 blog ordered it from iherb this 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.079
 amazing whitening toothpaste 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.990
 really very good whiten 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.270
 it has abrasive particles inflicted 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.159
 soft do not damage the enamel on my 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.459
 sensitive but with this pasta no 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.679
 There are no problems and people notice 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.899
 stunning whitening results 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.209
 so pay attention naturally 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.780
 all products will be at the bottom of the list of all 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.840
 products 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:17.370
 and then here is such a cream from how it is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.799
 called and rotating night cream 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.150
 so moisturizing 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.640
 box so it should open 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.060
 open should open no longer 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.630
 opens in general yes here and so here it is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.250
 it looks like it looks inside what I want 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.829
 say blade cream nothing 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.120
 supernatural Sobinov I did not notice 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.950
 the only thing I really like 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.040
 design 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.690
 boxes and everything but I'm him yes damn yes 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.910
 let no harm to use not 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.560
 put well and 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:55.360
 and something supernatural from him 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:59.030
 also did not see further tonic from shiseido 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.590
 ernest is a social tonic for fatty 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:08.000
 skin that is designed to balance 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.560
 oily skin but what do I want to say he did 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.630
 the skin is even fatter ie after 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.730
 using this tonic I started 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.650
 notice that my skin shines much 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.390
 faster so i'm fighting 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.870
 I can not say recommended or not 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.030
 because everything is individual but 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.930
 the owner of the combined and fat 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.390
 skin 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:36.230
 I probably still would not advise others 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:39.820
 works further and this is ink from meybellin 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.420
 Falls if and showed their favorites 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.070
 super carcass 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.900
 continuing her brothers and general probably on 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.530
 long with not very much i like it here and 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.350
 can really recommend 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.750
 not even over not over yet 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.290
 nail polish remover 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.790
 whether Yandex stores can not it 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.820
 use because it is such 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.780
 useless thing for really 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.790
 to erase 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.860
 elementary nail polish not saying the same 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.080
 tanks then bright colors some kind there even 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.620
 colorless then i needed 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.020
 probably 5 wadded disks because she 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.380
 does not wipe absolutely nothing and 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:28.419
 also when removing varnish yes further 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:33.500
 burdock oil with red pepper 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:38.570
 once ended and 2 received today 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.820
 thank you still mama 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.900
 Masochka can also see the blog 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.960
 I read and ended so me 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:53.010
 body mask from the firm and to exactly 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.690
 oil against cellulite 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.480
 Well, how to say I can not say what it is 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.410
 straight oil against cellulite super 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.020
 thing is very good oil why because 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.350
 that it is natural smells very nice 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.090
 on it you can make it you can make 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.910
 elementary base oils 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.950
 add juniper essential oils 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.450
 rosemary 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.620
 that is, those are the oils that are here 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.420
 for example and already on your way there 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.430
 orange and lemon to citrus grapefruit 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.800
 and do it yourself and and not bother 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.510
 about this but if he doesn't want that 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.010
 in principle i could advise very 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.980
 cool stuff very nice flavor 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.260
 Vanya creates the effect of such a dumb thing 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.690
 bath saunas something with essential oils but 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.640
 very very good but again 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.680
 expect him supernaturally 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:50.860
 the result is not worth it and 2 penultimate 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.350
 This hand cream bought here online 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.000
 adida shop 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.450
 vanilla sugar so much I liked 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.080
 that it is even cut times to dropped out very 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.430
 i like well moisturizes 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.210
 the sweetest scent is also all around 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.160
 they say that it smells very good 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.740
 that is, there is such a package 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.650
 cut literally a little bit very 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.040
 comfortable to carry with him so we we i 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.690
 could recommend a good thing and 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.350
 the last thing that didn’t end was not me 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:27.070
 throwing it just shine from neve 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.650

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.430
 name here bottom 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:36.520
 sticky thing rolls down it's just 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.050
 it is unpleasant to feel the aroma even on the lips 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.760
 very nice so sweet 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:46.390
 I like it but it feels on his lips 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.830
 rolls in the fold here and when 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:53.230
 talk and you can see here it is very straight 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.650
 bad quality very sticky both him 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.480

 many decided not to collect not 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.210
