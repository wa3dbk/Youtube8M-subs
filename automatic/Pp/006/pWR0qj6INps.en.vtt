00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 and good morning to you all and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 valentin for the test string in all 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.130
 kind and today in this new 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.139
 video is found to establish the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 new update windows 8 points 1 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 if you already have a computer under 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.840
 windows 8 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.730
 so already i'm going to show you in my 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.500
 control panel that I am 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 under a windows 8 computer 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.590
 so already you can see that my 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.179
 interface later looks like windows 8 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.470
 but I will show you that I have not 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.739
 still made the update so you 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 do not go our system configuration 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 again this system is there you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.820
 are going to have your processor and you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.110
 see that I am under windows 8 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.399
 so that's going to be really, really 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.920
 simple you will go to the corner in 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.530
 down you go go to your little 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.480
 windows store application and if you 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 basically see that its marks and put 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 up to windows 8 points 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.370
 for free and that's what will 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.489
 allow to put the update so 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 we will click on it and there we will click 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.760
 on download 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.199
 so if you do not have this yet 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.850
 update that is done in the windows 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 store is not worth doing or 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.490
 to look for others is that your 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.649
 computer has not yet 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.720
 was updated simply by the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.340
 mark so do not try to make any 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.390
 otherwise updates with windows 8 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.549
 points a preview 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.170
 it's not going to work and she will not be 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.750
 activated so for sure that it 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.770
 works do not hesitate to watch 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.329
 regularly 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.240
 in any case me she went out to 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.830
 really not long on my pc and I 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.630
 still wanted to make you the video 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 so there you see I click 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.869
 download the download will get 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 do it automatically 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.549
 you see we have a download 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.619
 about 4 gigas so it's likely to be 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.899
 a bit long then after there will be so 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.940
 the installation so there you see we 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.350
 has the download here the progression 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.959
 will show up here as an app 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.840
 in fact and when we pass the mouse 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.299
 above you see that at 0% completed so 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.220
 we will wait we will find ourselves right 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.039
 at the end of the installation and I'm going 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.720
 show you a little what it looks like 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.030
 and here I am starting my 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.560
 computer and the most modification 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.939
 flagrant of the update is 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.099
 frankly the button that were 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.780
 added here so he redirects us to 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.250
 the welcome and you see with the little 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.500
 arrow there we will have all the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.540
 applications installed on the device 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.650
 so we use there we will have the little 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.320
 search bar 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.079
 and if not that's pretty much all for the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.329
 update you will always have them 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.280
 applications on the board except that there he 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.109
 must add this button there instead 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 to go to the top corner and 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:35.200
 click on this button we will have it 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.150
 directly that will show up here 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.920
