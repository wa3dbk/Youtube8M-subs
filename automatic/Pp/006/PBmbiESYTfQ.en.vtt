00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.650
 it is very simple 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
 you have for half a day 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.299
 a day and a half 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 for the reinforcement pretty much the same for him 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 plumbing 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640
 the concrete also a resignation 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.439
 the techniques of bridge construction unusable your postulate 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 its even recognized port 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.279
 like the time the techniques appropriate to the construction of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.689
 pools more than a pool 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.160
 it's a full-fledged foundation today 8% and all the foundations 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 like any building that exist are made of reinforced concrete 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 the painful that one projected with forciori proposed technical studies 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.850
 this field the technique is quite unknown in France 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.550
 this summer the net 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.620
 which is called dry projection 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.720
 with these systems mans 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.420
 ebay parra 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.930
 and tunnels 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.530
 sector 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.860
 reinforced concrete very very resistant 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.200
 equipped with a distance of up to 100 meters 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.380
 and that allows 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.560
 most of our pools are made with coatings that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.470
 are exclusives of our society 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 who are of incorporated marble who are screened and high school 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.460
 which will give a completely natural aspect to the pool 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.690
 and we will be able to work in different colors of redmond can 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 not say highly white of stable coating to recommend 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.750
 we can not and coatings and teens are not and 2000 cav 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 inside that will give the crystalline reflection the pool according to firefighters 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.250
 which have been studied for 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.470
 Unlike the price 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.050
 other types of coatings that can be found on the market 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.630
 god in the adapted state 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.000
 including tiles by 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.460
 in summary as much on the type of projection inhabitant 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.690
 pedersen costs 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.840
 since the star 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
 hyper specialized she is waiting for that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 1200 christine paraisso of work 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 we try to get a message across 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.610
 priscilla explaining that a swimming pool is by an element that we go 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.040
 build for 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 finally it's something that must last one year but it is to make understand 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.089
 pay 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.729
 when buying a pool one must have a philosophy that is pretty much 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.189
 almost identical to that 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 already the philosophy that we can have when we console ourselves home 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.229
 we try to access the establishment of customers on 1 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.019
 a heritage investment 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.829
 they are presented 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.019
 and then typing in circles 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.749
 choose evolved form with% and tickets can come to office 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:32.799
 status 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.819
 nevertheless their fate plans 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.859
 visualize them we attended 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.009
 a photograph of the earth at home 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.869
 besides same plant at home the pool following their house 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.509
 in december 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.739
 we work a few times and landscaping 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.959
 we also have an internal design office 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.779
 but who will work on the development 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.779
 the project with the client 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.019
 share with our customers about 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.040
 on fire critics on the final project it will depend on the third 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.919
 ad 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.919
 see on the ground being really scared 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.389
 for advice I spoke earlier about her like the cloudy beaches 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.569
 according to her these two days 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 a track that is very appealing to children where it has little depth 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.849
 we will focus a little bit our customers perceive below things if 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.879
 actually it's also seniors there too the notion of the chimera g or 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.069
 balneotherapy eurozone does not pose that's something he says 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.289
 which pleases a lot too 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.629
 and then I play back on the environment because we propose 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.579
 as well 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.209
 dd infinity pool eg more with rocks and waterfalls 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 to really create an ambulance perreault found 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:40.529
 in e1 unifying element
