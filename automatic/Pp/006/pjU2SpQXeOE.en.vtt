 Hello everyone today, I will tell about 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.570
 detected bugs in Russian fishing 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.150
 this bug was repeated to me in the second 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.990
 maybe you remember in january 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.390
 month I opened the chests and there was a chest with 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.789
 minke who did not open 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.100
 I have already repeated this chest 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.510
 second time here they are these two chests 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.110

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.920

 time again caught again the second chest and 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:57.879
 What is interesting is there is no button to throw it away 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.879
 you cannot throw it away and it is impossible to open it 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:08.829
