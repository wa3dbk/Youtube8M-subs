00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the next layer is teaching other people

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
the next layer is teaching other people
it's<00:01:08.460> too<00:01:08.670> cold<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> south<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.630> actually

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it's too cold for the south to actually

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500 
it's too cold for the south to actually
stay<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.530> liquid<00:01:11.130> temperature<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:12.240> needs<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
stay at liquid temperature it needs to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.820 
stay at liquid temperature it needs to
be<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.600> 40<00:01:12.990> degrees<00:01:13.049> which<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> actually

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
be about 40 degrees which can actually

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
be about 40 degrees which can actually
turn<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.340> water<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.570> currently<00:01:16.200> about

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
turn into water so it's currently about

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.789 
turn into water so it's currently about
15<00:01:17.070> degrees<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.270> frozen<00:01:18.659> solid<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
15 degrees so it's frozen solid this is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.270 
15 degrees so it's frozen solid this is
not<00:01:20.009> good<00:01:20.570> shivering<00:01:21.570> weather<00:01:21.780> oh<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.259> no<00:01:22.409> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
not good shivering weather oh no no I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.649 
not good shivering weather oh no no I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
think we actually have a little bit of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
think we actually have a little bit of
frozen<00:01:24.960> SAP<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:25.979> here's<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
