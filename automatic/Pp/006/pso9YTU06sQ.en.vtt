00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.400
 now 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.900
 hello friends I greet your friend george 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.560
 anthony 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.560
 and this time 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.960
 you look for the channel 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.129
 best tutorials 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.129
 and this time we are going to 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.300
 a game what many 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.170
 well and what I do 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.149
 only apart from uploading videos 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.149
 it's like doing 15 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.580
 how to do 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.119
 let's start 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.150
 how 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.060
 or have the basic programs for 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.659
 and be able to start doing it good 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.659
 the description 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.110
 from there that will be this 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.110
 which brings to the m 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.290
 once you have it downloaded 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 what 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.450
 is 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 this folder contains what is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.759
 it was called cradle 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.730
 scott 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.260
 one 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.980
 has a file that is a low 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.300
 of 81 7 is the file which we 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.989
 will allow 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.290
 and the most important one that does not 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.400
 i 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.329
 in this case I 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.329
 I recommend it 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.510
 I have a separate folder just in case 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.390
 I'm lost 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.390
 here I have the 9 v 81 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.550
 First 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.630
 we are going to install the refreshments 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.630
 we give it to him like that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.810
 but that is installed 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.920
 this procedure very 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.760
 very fast and easy 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.760
 and happy 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.700
 I hate work 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.760
 and let's see 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.220
 with which he has worked 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.610
 once I have a second form 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.010
 in the folder min 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.020
 and after the goal, but I can see myself 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.540
 how it touches us because I have when I met 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.459
 with 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.510
 to get them out on the ice as an application 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.189
 for this type of applications 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.130
 once you have this for the first time 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.600
 I will ask you to choose the route 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.550
 hamas file 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.310
 in Europe 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.370
 and they choose the folder and the folder of the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.870
 game 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.870
 although you can open the h 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.460
 and they choose the file that I told them where 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.390
 your 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.650
 in this case 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.650
 a folder the book for me 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.349
 once we have all the 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.349
 the hidden folders of the quad 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.170
 basically cover it with what we say 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.359
 and we select 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.759
 which left to export 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.240
 will choose where they want me to go in this 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.160
 case of fire origin 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.160
 they must choose what is of the game 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:37.370
 and then in choosing data they give them ok 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.370
 in my case I 'm going to give him to cancel 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.169
 before doing this let's go 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.130
 as it is said to update the files 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.130
 beats 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.169
 and they'll wait for me to update 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.840
 this case I will not do it because I have the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.849
 extracted assets and after this just 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.980
 you will be able to 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:06.290
 what is exporting the folders 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.290
 Let's see what I'll come back and return 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.889
 well I do return when you 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.479
 have exported each lemon folder 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.479
 let's go in the location 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.110
 there is more 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:33.160
 dance again then lots of data and then 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.110
 in the folder they will appear what 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.660
 which are all the folders of all 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:43.050
 we saw - the new ones are updated 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.009
 for example the new ones are like the demo 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.319
 paladin the new 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:52.190
 we live the beasts that have come out and 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:55.660
 it's good that as you will see 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.660
 let's work with 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.240
 and AndrÃ©s Lima to communicate we are going to give 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.510
 assemblies 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.800
 we give it to ok and we can give it 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.560
 once we have 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:17.350
 although we give we are going to work 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.350
 perhaps we are going to work what is 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.380
 now if we look 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.970
 but let's ask 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.460
 As you can see, scott files open 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.389
 you can take what the blog from 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.830
 here and here you can see the limo 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.520
 but there's something inventive about that 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.520
 needs to 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.650
 when we already have the lemon we are going to 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.360
 start working with the textures 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.040
 so that you can modify it 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.460
 but this will be in the next video 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.020
 since it will be very long and in the 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.689
 Next video will be how to avoid 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.899
 textures 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:10.889
 so wait no and hopefully continue 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.539
 watching in my videos 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.419
 I'm going to do a great series of tutorials 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:18.680
 for this game and I hope there will be 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:22.729
 liked and at the same time served this tutorial 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:25.110

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:27.450

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.550
 I hope you have a good time and for what 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.860
