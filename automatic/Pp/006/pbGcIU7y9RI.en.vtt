00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all of me vii century we are of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.550
 new in clash of land guys this time 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.019
 we are here in the empire of the pk because 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 I tell you that because I'm going to make a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.099
 different video a long time ago I already have 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.450
 the pk and I have not told you well what 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.100
 have you seen maybe in some video for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.170
 and loose or maybe I mentioned it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 ever but never made an attack 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.939
 like the one I'm going to do now that if the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
 empire sins because it turns out that these 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.910
 individuals have decided to take power 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 of clash of plants 5 freckles 2 healers 7 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.920
 I will break walls and 8 magicians according good 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 really in the castle the field is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 I have one more that is, six pikes are going 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 to do with the power of clash of clans 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.570
 they are going to build an empire based on 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.520
 the confusion is not the intrigue in the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.430
 mystery because I still do not think 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.559
 know if the pk is a girl or a boy 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 so I 'm telling you they 're going to try to take 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.309
 the command we are going to look for a village 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.860
 that really suits us for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.320
 make this great attack 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.090
 and let's see let's see could 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280
 destroy this but I would also like 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.410
 that had enough the ix eros 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.120
 the east is for example for example 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.080

 and we throw the king behind right there I hope 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.490
 that you do not see that because there was a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 small happy but good if you do not see it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.509

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.610

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.460
 it's around here is worth the town hall left 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.200
 out that is, it's amazing 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.510
 intelligence but incredible incredible 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.770
 boys godmother bear would throw rage for 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.540
 the pec to see what he can do here with 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.100
 a rage I think it's really going to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.140
 empty what has been all the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.370
 my mother you already see wizards really 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.900
 I'm doing a kind mega attack and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.750
 I'm going to take all the dark sky 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.520
 Mother of God and I do not do one hundred percent 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.770
 not even two stars because I was 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.150
 the council has forgotten the boys 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.340
 I know, I do not need anyone to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 remember how smart they are 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.600
 attack seriously nothing does nothing of 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.100
 missing let's see if we can make a 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.230
 one hundred percent I still believe that the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.090
 freckles have fulfilled their work the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.980
 magicians are still here giving a little 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 of cane the level 4 to see if it raise it already 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 level 5 I start doing mega attacks and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.860
 others and good it seems that this for 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.230
 that finished these magicians because they are there 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.750
 doing nothing practically then nothing 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.970
 here ends this fight guys a 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.560
 It's a shame, honestly, because 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.600
 could have been two simply 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.250
 pulling even a simple barbarian to 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.840
 town hall that by the way I have to 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.610
 give you a little detail my mother 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.170
 because it is jumping so much publicity in 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.790
 this video 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.560
 touch detail length and that is that I've 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.239
 left a free space because that is was 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.530
 odd number and could have gotten an 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.720
 barbarian with whom to throw the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.120
 City Hall but no guys express 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.459
 liked the freckles have managed to dominate 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.230
 clash of clans and if you liked the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.030
 video just 200 I like for 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.620
 daily video tomorrow I bring you a video 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.200
 Well surely a rise of 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.430
 glasses to master or crystal if you have 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.290
