I<00:00:01.829> want<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.040> talk<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.250> because<00:00:02.730> he<00:00:03.120> went<00:00:03.419> off

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I want to talk about because he went off

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.440 
I want to talk about because he went off
in<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.350> game<00:00:04.650> so<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.640> was<00:00:05.759> very<00:00:05.819> clear<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
in that game so it was very clear the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.030 
in that game so it was very clear the
two<00:00:06.660> strategies<00:00:07.109> from<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.410> two<00:00:07.560> teams<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
two strategies from the two teams in the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.549 
two strategies from the two teams in the
opening<00:00:08.429> medias<00:00:09.389> was<00:00:09.570> camping<00:00:09.929> dyrus<00:00:10.320> as

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
opening medias was camping dyrus as

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.220 
opening medias was camping dyrus as
usual<00:00:11.099> vs<00:00:11.340> TSM<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.090> centauran<00:00:12.630> trying<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
usual vs TSM and centauran trying to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.620 
usual vs TSM and centauran trying to
keep<00:00:13.440> down<00:00:13.710> sneaky<00:00:14.250> there's<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.820> reason<00:00:15.150> that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
keep down sneaky there's a reason that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.160 
keep down sneaky there's a reason that
we<00:00:16.230> say<00:00:16.440> every<00:00:16.710> single<00:00:17.640> split<00:00:17.940> sneaky<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.930> this

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
we say every single split sneaky is this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.019 
we say every single split sneaky is this
consistent<00:00:19.650> performer<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.400> cloud<00:00:20.609> nine<00:00:20.820> he's

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
consistent performer for cloud nine he's

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.630 
consistent performer for cloud nine he's
the<00:00:21.210> backbone<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.140> team<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:23.010> saw<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.340> here

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the backbone of this team we saw it here

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.420 
the backbone of this team we saw it here
they<00:00:23.820> threw<00:00:24.359> everything<00:00:24.869> at<00:00:25.289> sneaky<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
they threw everything at sneaky and the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849 
they threw everything at sneaky and the
dodges<00:00:27.000> he<00:00:27.180> barely<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.260> many<00:00:28.470> times

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
dodges he barely got out so many times

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.189 
dodges he barely got out so many times
they<00:00:29.340> took<00:00:29.580> all<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.210> pressure<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.840> as<00:00:31.050> he

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
they took all of that pressure and as he

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.420 
they took all of that pressure and as he
said<00:00:31.410> he<00:00:31.590> did<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.250> average

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
said he did it all with an average

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.810 
said he did it all with an average
played<00:00:32.940> staying<00:00:33.719> even<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.590> CS<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.730> was

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
played staying even in CS it was it was

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.490 
played staying even in CS it was it was
actually<00:00:36.360> ridiculous<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:37.020> watch<00:00:37.170> yeah<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
actually ridiculous to watch yeah and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.959 
actually ridiculous to watch yeah and
then<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> flip<00:00:38.100> side<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
then on the flip side of that the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
then on the flip side of that the
pressure<00:00:39.210> wasn't<00:00:39.480> sticking<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:40.110> he<00:00:40.320> was

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
pressure wasn't sticking there he was

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
pressure wasn't sticking there he was
diffusing<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.820> were<00:00:41.879> applying

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
diffusing it and then they were applying

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
diffusing it and then they were applying
it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> dyrus<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> bottom<00:00:43.680> side<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it to dyrus on the bottom side and that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
it to dyrus on the bottom side and that
was<00:00:44.280> sticking<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.789> killed<00:00:45.059> him<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.629> got

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
was sticking they killed him they got

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
was sticking they killed him they got
the<00:00:46.140> turret<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> lead<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the turret and that was the lead that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
the turret and that was the lead that
perpetuated<00:00:48.329> cloud<00:00:48.840> nine<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> mid<00:00:49.649> game

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
perpetuated cloud nine into the mid game

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.549 
perpetuated cloud nine into the mid game
and<00:00:50.070> gave<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.520> 5k<00:00:50.789> gold<00:00:51.300> lead<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and gave them at 5k gold lead that was

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.930 
and gave them at 5k gold lead that was
really<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.219> well<00:00:53.460> played<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.760> that's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
really really well played because that's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.310 
really really well played because that's
all<00:00:54.090> sneaky<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.660> point<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.140> let's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
all sneaky at that point right so let's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
all sneaky at that point right so let's
talk<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> lead<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> secured

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
talk about that lead that they secured

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
because as you mentioned both teams

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
because as you mentioned both teams
decided<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> throw<00:00:59.160> pressure<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
decided to throw pressure on the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
decided to throw pressure on the
opposite<00:01:00.239> sides<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> map<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.020> had<00:01:01.109> TSM

their vision stand in the brush and as

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.440 
their vision stand in the brush and as
you<00:03:05.130> said<00:03:05.310> yes<00:03:05.550> there's<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> possibility<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
you said yes there's the possibility of

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.870 
you said yes there's the possibility of
