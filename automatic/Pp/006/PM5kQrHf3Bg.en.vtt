00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.699
 very good kids that as you are 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.220
 welcome to another video analysis of 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.450
 multiplayer of the disks in the bÃ­o 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.969
 earlier as you know we have analyzed 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.710
 the advantages and the runs of casualties and in 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.299
 this time we are going to analyze the most 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.950
 important and the creation of your own 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.170
 soldier is what you are going to play with 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.970
 in the battlefield and we go the 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.500
 class creation but the truth that in 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.480
 this game they have done with a 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.170
 customization ability 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.910
 awesome we go there with the sea 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.070
 rubin because he tells us about the 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.930
 squad points that are the squad points 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.610
 Well, let's say that you are playing the game 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.890
 it is going up in level and at the same time 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.750
 they are gaining this kind of currency 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.670
 called squad points that you will need 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.080
 to buy practically everything for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.100
 buy weapons to buy accessories 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.890
 to buy secondaries to buy c4 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.780
 grenades let's say to unlock everything 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.910
 the equipment that we have but is that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.710
 this does not end here the coins the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.410
 we need to buy practically 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.640
 everything apart we have the squats that do not 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.400
 let's customize just one soldier 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.440
 let's have a patrol of ten 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.420
 soldiers which will be totally 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.399
 We are going to customize them independently 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.140
 to our taste that we want it to be 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.500
 black that we want it to be bald that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.630
 we want it to be 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.560
 a bastard I just given me is that 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.240
 look at the capacity of 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.860
 customization in this image you can 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.140
 customize the genre the head the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.580
 helmet the uniform the camouflage on the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.350
 clan badge we're going practically 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.850
 we can all make a soldier of 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.410
 our taste there will be no two soldiers 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.900
 same unless it's done in a can 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.070
 spiderman fly in that case all will be 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.380
 same but it's awesome 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.840
 because every soldier is also going to have 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.690
 within the ten soldiers each soldier 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.030
 will be able to prestige we will be able to 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.400
 prestige it once which if ten 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 soldiers then we will have ten levels 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.810
 of prestige imagine about the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.490
 ability to personalize and play 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.009
 that gives this because when we prestige 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.470
 Each soldier can specialize in 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.899
 one in one action in a category of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.289
 weapons we can adapt every soldier to 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.850
 a series of features and it's very 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.110
 very good customization ability 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 and have say 10 different types of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.530
 players the truth that is very very 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.310
 well the personalization ability the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 Truth that surprised me 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 quite so good once 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.950
 let's say about the creation of the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 squat of the creation of your soldier we go 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.520
 to move on to talk about game modes 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.900
 kids about the game modes 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.510
 we have here in this image passed to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
 slow motion all against all just for 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.860
 teams seeks to destroy low domination 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.290
 confirmed and from here all are 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.290
 new because there is rescue credible grant 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 that infected that returns hunter and save 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.610
 war all the latest are let's say new 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.470
 less infected and is the infected that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.420
 we all believe and if only we have 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.090
 given information on two modes of 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.340
 game search and rescue and the clan that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 you seek to rescue is like a search 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.060
 destroy nothing but with badges if 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.860
 was an ally you take your badge and the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.930
 ally to revive was going to be able to continue 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.940
 playing and if you kill an enemy if you 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.410
 you take the badge of the enemy because your 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.940
 enemies are not going to have the option of 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.040
 revive it because let's say that the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.709
 removed his badge and another is that they will 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.660
 that 'as the movie is basically 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.330
 like a team bull when you kill 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.870
 you get an impetuous you get there a 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.820
 heroin injection and then more fucked 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.410
 and you have 30 seconds to kill another 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.900
 player if in those 30 seconds do not 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.310
 you kill and you start again 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.680
 so I really liked the truth 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.760
 because it's pretty let's say dynamic 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.319
 invite the player to say move to no 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.659
 campear and such was going to be a game mode 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.519
 quick of which I like so 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.959
 when the search and rescue is also 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.510
 quite the same and search and destroy with 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.180
 plan badges you take it revives if not 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.370
 you catch it do not relive the truth that I 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.930
 It attracts a lot and it's pretty good like that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.760
 when these are both we are from the game 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.799
 who have given information we have a 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.329
 bunch around you go back to 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.849
 back to the video in roulette is we have 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.920
 is that if bill and that if green let's say a 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.540
 lots of game modes has also been 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.750
 implanted a new category of weapons 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.879
 which is called the marx man rifles that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.489
 it's like a class that is among the 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.470
 sniper rifles and the 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.930
 assault rifles is like some weapons that 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.989
 as it says for the long average distance 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.250
 there would be all the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.049
 snipers we know 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.629
 semi-automatic that need two shots 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.579
 in the body to kill that also 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.769
 we can customize them with a look or 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.450
 no and here finally they have given us the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.370
 surprise that it was good time that 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.239
 will introduce women soldier with 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.340
 all the girls who play 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.289
 call of duty and also good it was time 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.669
 there was soldier female soldiers 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.289
 in those in the games I'm thinking 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.389
 I'm going to customize it and I'm going to 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.660
 put a thong on the aunt and I'll put 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.340
 nude we're going to customize the the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.770
 welder woman 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.849
 you imagine you customize a woman 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.849
 soldier who gets in the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.760
 I do not think there's that enormous capacity 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.500
 customization offered by the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.550
 it's really fine that way when this 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.650
 it has been the second video we have analyzed 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.140
 the creation of the soldier the modes of 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.110
 game in the new innovative class and 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.450
 until design half between Tuesdays 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.760
 half bread between sniper what 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.170
 there's between sniper and rifle 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.790
 assault forgiveness and good women 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.770
 soldier that maybe plans plans 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.199
 naked and such 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.030
 this has been the second video I have left 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.590
 still several things to polish but 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.080
 well they are less important are the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.520
 last maybe the video that goes up 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.620
 after this is already the last 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.539
 of good multiplayer analysis already 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.770
 added almost another video of all the 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.090
 impressions that this is giving me 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.919
 because basically I'm here 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.780
 analyzing things in this telling me 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.729
 opinion as well as from people that has 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.050
 liked or such liked favorites we 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.050
 we see in the next goodbye
