00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
can use this for each one of those

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.799 
can use this for each one of those
adapters<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.450> cool

adapters which is actually really cool

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
adapters which is actually really cool
so<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.070> open<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.910> are<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so when you open it up here we are in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
so when you open it up here we are in
easy<00:00:42.899> mode<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> actually

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
easy mode and that's going to actually

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
easy mode and that's going to actually
show<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.940> network<00:00:45.180> adapter<00:00:45.450> MAC

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
show you your network adapter MAC

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.190 
show you your network adapter MAC
address<00:00:46.469> IP<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.370> ping<00:00:48.090> time<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.079> down

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
address IP and ping time if you go down

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.209 
address IP and ping time if you go down
here<00:00:49.230> there's<00:00:49.559> four<00:00:49.739> different<00:00:49.770> sections

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
here there's four different sections

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.000 
here there's four different sections
there's<00:00:50.610> VoIP<00:00:50.910> media<00:00:51.840> streaming<00:00:52.110> games<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
there's VoIP media streaming games and

there's VoIP media streaming games and
file<00:00:53.520> sharing<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.210> where<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.390> going

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
file sharing and this is where you going

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750 
file sharing and this is where you going
to<00:00:54.570> set<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> priorities<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.770> different

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to set the priorities for different

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
to set the priorities for different
types<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.300> things<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.590> know

this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.680> setting<00:01:25.950> different<00:01:26.040> priorities<00:01:26.729> for

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this is setting different priorities for

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
this is setting different priorities for
different<00:01:27.689> types<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> programs<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> again

different types of programs and again

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
different types of programs and again
those<00:01:29.490> programs<00:01:30.060> include<00:01:30.930> VoIP<00:01:31.409> media

what's going on on your network adapter

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
what's going on on your network adapter
which<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:02.040> pretty<00:02:02.189> cool<00:02:02.430> down<00:02:03.060> here

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
which is actually pretty cool down here

which is actually pretty cool down here
you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.140> calibrate<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.740> line<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.219> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
you can calibrate your line which of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.709 
you can calibrate your line which of
course<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.729> first<00:02:05.909> time<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.270> run<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
course the first time you run this I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.839 
course the first time you run this I
would<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.110> suggest<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.580> can

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
would really suggest you do that you can

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.600 
would really suggest you do that you can
run<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> speed<00:02:09.509> test<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.129> see<00:02:11.430> your

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
run a speed test you can see your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
run a speed test you can see your
current<00:02:11.819> connections<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.660> click<00:02:12.780> on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
current connections so if we click on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.820 
current connections so if we click on
here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.990 
here
we<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.400> anything<00:02:14.610> running<00:02:14.910> you'll

connection<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.530> something<00:02:31.710> like<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.070> you're

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
connection or something like that you're

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.340 
connection or something like that you're
going<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.790> maybe<00:02:33.090> something<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.900> your

going really so maybe something in your
system<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.980> could<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> virus<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> could<00:02:35.790> be

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
system it could be a virus it could be

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.270 
system it could be a virus it could be
anything<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:37.680> draining<00:02:38.040> your

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
anything that's really draining your

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
anything that's really draining your
system<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.240> go<00:02:39.360> ahead<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.930> see<00:02:40.230> what's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
system you can go ahead and see what's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.930 
system you can go ahead and see what's
going<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.740> right<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:40.980> about<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.670> local

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
going on right here about all your local

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.340 
going on right here about all your local
connections<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.780> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> freeze

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
connections and you can kind of freeze

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.200 
connections and you can kind of freeze
the<00:02:43.590> screen<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.460> say<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> ton<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
the screen so say you have a ton of

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.580 
the screen so say you have a ton of
stuff<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:46.050> see<00:02:46.200> things<00:02:46.380> are

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
stuff up and you can see things are

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.320 
stuff up and you can see things are
coming<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.280> disappearing<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.970> can

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
coming up and disappearing you can

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.000 
coming up and disappearing you can
freeze<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> screen<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.380> see<00:02:49.500> exactly

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
freeze the screen so you can see exactly

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.900 
freeze the screen so you can see exactly
what's<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.490> on<00:02:51.470> close<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.710> up<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.070> we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
what's going on close that up and we

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.240 
what's going on close that up and we
also<00:02:54.210> have<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> usage<00:02:55.170> graph<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.130> go

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
also have a usage graph which you can go

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
also have a usage graph which you can go
ahead<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.670> see<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.600> good<00:02:57.930> especially

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
ahead and see so this is good especially

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.800 
ahead and see so this is good especially
if<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> connection<00:02:59.460> that<00:03:00.210> doesn't

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
if you're on a connection that doesn't

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.220 
if you're on a connection that doesn't
have<00:03:01.370> or<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.610> does<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> threshold

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
have or that does have like a threshold

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.380 
have or that does have like a threshold
as<00:03:04.770> far<00:03:04.980> as<00:03:05.070> bandwidth<00:03:05.490> goes<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.060> see<00:03:06.240> how

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
as far as bandwidth goes you can see how

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.270 
as far as bandwidth goes you can see how
much<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:07.020> should<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.380> are<00:03:07.500> doing<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
much you should you are doing and you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.670 
much you should you are doing and you
can<00:03:08.400> set<00:03:08.580> up<00:03:08.610> through<00:03:08.880> different<00:03:09.180> protocols

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
can set up through different protocols

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.930 
can set up through different protocols
you<00:03:10.680> know<00:03:10.770> different<00:03:11.130> clients<00:03:11.580> everything

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
you know different clients everything

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.150 
you know different clients everything
like<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.270> what<00:03:12.840> actually<00:03:13.080> shows<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.800> here

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
like that what actually shows up here

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
like that what actually shows up here
just<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.730> kind<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> know<00:03:15.270> what's<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.720> on

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
just so you kind of know what's going on

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.930 
just so you kind of know what's going on
you<00:03:15.990> can<00:03:16.020> show<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> month<00:03:16.830> 12<00:03:17.550> month<00:03:17.760> 3

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
you can show it for a month 12 month 3

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.120 
you can show it for a month 12 month 3
month<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:19.350> current<00:03:19.680> month<00:03:19.890> which<00:03:20.040> is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
month and the current month which is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.450 
month and the current month which is
actually<00:03:20.430> pretty<00:03:20.610> cool<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:23.220> believe

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
actually pretty cool and I believe

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.880 
actually pretty cool and I believe
that's<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.210> this<00:03:24.450> basic<00:03:24.900> section<00:03:25.620> yeah<00:03:25.740> so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
that's it in this basic section yeah so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.830 
that's it in this basic section yeah so
that's<00:03:26.070> basically<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.600> easy

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that's basically it here in the easy

activate the firewall you can block a

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.220 
activate the firewall you can block a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.270 
sending you a ton of traffic or slowing
you<00:04:06.060> down<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.690> can<00:04:06.870> actually<00:04:07.140> block<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.980> IP

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
you down you can actually block that IP

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.670 
you down you can actually block that IP
you<00:04:09.000> can<00:04:09.150> set<00:04:09.330> up<00:04:09.360> automatic<00:04:09.690> mms

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you can set up automatic mms

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.300 
you can set up automatic mms
optimization<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:12.930> set<00:04:13.170> strict<00:04:13.530> RTP

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
optimization and you can set strict RTP

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.740 
optimization and you can set strict RTP
checks<00:04:15.090> as<00:04:15.360> well<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.440> protocols<00:04:16.920> here

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
checks as well in a protocols here

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.390 
checks as well in a protocols here
they're<00:04:18.750> they're<00:04:19.620> set<00:04:19.770> into<00:04:20.010> different

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
they're they're set into different

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.850 
they're they're set into different
categories<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.420> have<00:04:21.540> special<00:04:21.989> client

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
categories so you have special client

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.430 
categories so you have special client
protocols<00:04:23.720> media<00:04:24.720> streaming<00:04:25.020> server

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
protocols media streaming server

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.620 
protocols media streaming server
protocols<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.220> file<00:04:26.520> sharing<00:04:26.550> so

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
protocols and file sharing so

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.150 
protocols and file sharing so
say<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.810> do<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.230> BitTorrent<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:29.010> can

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
say you do a lot of BitTorrent you can

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.090 
say you do a lot of BitTorrent you can
actually<00:04:29.400> turn<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.300> priority<00:04:30.930> all<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.950> way

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
actually turn that priority all the way

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.100 
actually turn that priority all the way
up<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:32.880> actually<00:04:33.000> set<00:04:33.390> limits<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:33.930> it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
up and you can actually set limits on it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.920 
up and you can actually set limits on it
as<00:04:34.230> well<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.740> each<00:04:35.100> one<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.400> these<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:36.660> know<00:04:36.780> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
as well on each one of these you know so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.420 
as well on each one of these you know so
I<00:04:36.990> can<00:04:37.170> set<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.350> all<00:04:37.530> up<00:04:37.560> say<00:04:37.860> if<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.220> lot

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
I can set that all up say if I do a lot

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.550 
I can set that all up say if I do a lot
of<00:04:38.460> torrenting<00:04:38.910> or<00:04:39.180> something<00:04:39.750> like<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
of torrenting or something like that and

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.230 
of torrenting or something like that and
there<00:04:40.710> again<00:04:41.040> they're<00:04:41.220> all<00:04:41.250> four<00:04:41.700> different

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
there again they're all four different

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.770 
there again they're all four different
things<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.780> know<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:43.290> DNS<00:04:44.160> FTP<00:04:45.150> things<00:04:45.600> like

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
things you know so DNS FTP things like

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.350 
things you know so DNS FTP things like
that<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.260> change<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.890> that<00:04:47.640> around

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
that you can change all of that around

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.570 
that you can change all of that around
programs<00:04:49.170> is<00:04:49.380> basically<00:04:50.040> like<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> same

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
programs is basically like the same

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.450 
programs is basically like the same
thing<00:04:50.990> but<00:04:51.990> it's<00:04:52.140> for<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.350> program<00:04:52.770> itself<00:04:53.130> so

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
thing but it's for the program itself so

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.910 
thing but it's for the program itself so
again<00:04:53.880> bit<00:04:54.750> torn<00:04:55.020> here<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.320> can<00:04:55.620> set<00:04:55.770> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
again bit torn here I can set the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560 
again bit torn here I can set the
priority<00:04:56.130> all<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:57.060> way<00:04:57.120> up<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.330> is<00:04:57.450> just

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
priority all the way up this is just

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.690 
priority all the way up this is just
like<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:57.840> saw<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.170> easy<00:04:58.350> mode<00:04:58.650> but<00:04:59.610> of

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
like we saw in the easy mode but of

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.160 
like we saw in the easy mode but of
course<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.180> go<00:05:00.330> into<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.660> little<00:05:00.840> bit<00:05:00.960> you

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
course you can go into a little bit you

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.240 
course you can go into a little bit you
can<00:05:01.290> see<00:05:01.440> everything<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.710> lot<00:05:01.830> easier<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:02.190> this

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
can see everything a lot easier in this

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.530 
can see everything a lot easier in this
mode<00:05:02.460> as<00:05:02.610> well

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
mode as well

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.510 
mode as well
and<00:05:03.750> again<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.200> can<00:05:04.320> actually<00:05:04.590> add<00:05:05.010> a<00:05:05.340> new

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
and again you can actually add a new

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.610 
and again you can actually add a new
program<00:05:05.970> if<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.990> if<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.560> a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
program if you like and if it's a

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.350 
program if you like and if it's a
program<00:05:07.980> that's<00:05:08.190> not<00:05:08.340> actually<00:05:08.640> in<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.970> list

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
program that's not actually in the list

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.170 
program that's not actually in the list
you<00:05:09.510> can<00:05:09.720> suggest<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:11.100> team<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.000> they

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
you can suggest it to the team and they

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.730 
you can suggest it to the team and they
might<00:05:12.360> actually<00:05:12.570> add<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:13.080> into<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:13.440> newer

is pretty cool again you can use it on

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.770 
is pretty cool again you can use it on
any<00:06:31.740> one<00:06:31.980> of<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:32.160> network<00:06:32.430> adapters<00:06:32.910> that<00:06:33.540> you
