for<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> living<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.329> design<00:00:33.570> products<00:00:33.930> for

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
for a living so we design products for

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.510 
for a living so we design products for
other<00:00:34.140> people<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.980> our<00:00:35.070> major<00:00:35.280> customers

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
other people one of our major customers

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
other people one of our major customers
is<00:00:35.940> Saku<00:00:36.239> toe<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.570> does<00:00:36.809> shoulder<00:00:37.110> mounts

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is Saku toe which does shoulder mounts

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.150 
is Saku toe which does shoulder mounts
hand<00:00:37.620> rigs<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.129> professional<00:00:39.079> exactly<00:00:40.160> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
hand rigs more professional exactly so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.950 
hand rigs more professional exactly so
we<00:00:41.309> saw<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> knee<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.390> understood

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we saw a knee or we actually understood

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
we saw a knee or we actually understood
you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.920> made<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> difference<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you know how it made the difference to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
you know how it made the difference to
have<00:00:44.899> proper<00:00:45.899> rigs<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> stuff<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.800> your

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
have proper rigs and stuff for your

have proper rigs and stuff for your
equipment<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.579> made<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> difference

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
equipment you know made the difference

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
equipment you know made the difference
in<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> photos<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> video<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
in all the photos in the video with the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.889 
in all the photos in the video with the
point<00:00:50.579> shoot<00:00:50.760> cameras<00:00:51.059> disappearing<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
point shoot cameras disappearing and the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.479 
point shoot cameras disappearing and the
iPhones<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> Android<00:00:52.829> device<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> taking

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
iPhones the Android device is taking

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.220 
iPhones the Android device is taking
over<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.850> saw<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> need<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> rig<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
over we saw a need for a rig for the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
over we saw a need for a rig for the
phone<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.710> hence<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.430> started<00:00:56.730> designing<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
phone and hence we started designing the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
phone and hence we started designing the
Gryphon<00:00:57.360> shoot<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> what's<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.350> nice<00:00:58.500> about

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
Gryphon shoot and what's so nice about

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
Gryphon shoot and what's so nice about
this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> phones<00:00:59.789> they're

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this is because the phones they're

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.220 
this is because the phones they're
getting<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> know<00:01:00.510> they're<00:01:00.660> getting<00:01:00.750> thinner

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
getting you know they're getting thinner

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
getting you know they're getting thinner
and<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:02.070> actually<00:01:02.489> hard<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> hold<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.539> hold

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and it's actually hard to hold them hold

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.910 
and it's actually hard to hold them hold
them<00:01:03.960> steady<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> feel<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.739> you're

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
them steady or you feel like you're

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
them steady or you feel like you're
gonna<00:01:05.040> drop<00:01:05.400> them<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> time<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.390> that's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
gonna drop them all the time so that's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.670 
gonna drop them all the time so that's
what<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> loved<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680

we<00:01:20.460> solve<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.820> problem<00:01:20.909> by<00:01:21.210> attaching<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we solve this problem by attaching the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
we solve this problem by attaching the
handle<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.080> phone<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.950> comfort

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
handle to your phone so you have comfort

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
handle to your phone so you have comfort
support<00:01:23.490> stability<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.630> took<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> step

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
support stability now we took it a step

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.510 
support stability now we took it a step
further<00:01:25.380> by<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.619> adding<00:01:25.979> buttons<00:01:26.310> on

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
further by actually adding buttons on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.039 
further by actually adding buttons on
the<00:01:26.610> grip<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.540> buttons<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:27.930> in

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the grip so these two buttons here in

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.179 
the grip so these two buttons here in

of a video and that's what I love

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200

video<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.780> always<00:01:36.930> shaky<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.590> hit

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
video is always shaky because you hit

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.870 
video is always shaky because you hit
that<00:01:37.860> button<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> moves<00:01:38.729> that

camera<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.659> bit<00:01:39.780> by<00:01:39.930> triggering<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
camera a little bit by triggering it

down here you get that shake out of
there<00:01:41.850> completely<00:01:42.299> exactly<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.500> not
