00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.830
 charity so whose purpose is to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.300
 to educate and give free 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.349
 guide dogs blinded to the blind 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.150
 who ask us 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.180
 its geographical territory is 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.370
 near 13 departments around him in 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.890
 doubs up to the ardeche and the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 Swiss border so hamas up to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.309
 clermont ferrand there is a very good 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.780
 madam de sade and we receive the 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.030
 request which is a written request the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.469
 most of the time and well we do 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.350
 a species of investigation to know 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.320
 the profile of the person who 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.809
 request ie to know if it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.039
 will be able to use the dog correctly 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.199
 we will make it available to him 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.170
 with the physical means she 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.760
 still has if she knows in order 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.330
 general move what's called to 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.430
 the can 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.380
 that is to say that they were autonomous 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.299
 the can well we can consider 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.240
 give a guide dog to this person 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.920
 the dog being chosen according to 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.189
 its ability to speed reliability 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.610
 so we're trying to do that and that's 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.979
 of the field of two techniques to do 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.990
 a marriage that is harmonious between 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.030
 guide dog and the blind we take 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.770
 dogs that come from three big 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.289
 breeds that are first the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.390
 labrador then eventually the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.649
 golden retriever is also a shepherd 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.149
 German host families are 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.950
 families and who quite voluntarily 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.380
 take commit to taking dogs l 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.579
 two months old and educate them 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.799
 until the age of approval 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:02.469
 about a year and they have to 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.899
 charge for them to socialize the dog 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.360
 lately they are taken again at the age of 1 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.950
 here and there they are taken in hand by 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.790
 educators and specialized educators 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.459
 graduates who make it that they go in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.079
 to make guide dogs blinded 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.079
 that is, they teach them a 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.970
 number of commands they 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.849
 learn about the simulation course 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.799
 that we have here at first 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.269
 then very quickly they go into the 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.349
 nearest town which for us is 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.299
 cityfranche sur saone 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.840
 where he began to take some 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.090
 many things the bus eventually to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.090
 take the bus learn to circulate in 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.459
 traffic on the sidewalks and a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.799
 little everywhere in the guys got 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.269
 soon after we take them to lyon 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.780
 for him to know a little more 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.510
 things 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.549
 the trading center of the part-god the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.760
 kindness to welcome us and 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.260
 we take advantage of this structure 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.120
 to let them know the stopovers 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.040
 time things of a newspaper things that 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.340
 will of course use a little 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.340
 later 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.069
 have some 112 am not no 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.499
 birth light 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.840
 I am late sighted this is at 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:17.409
 to say that I have a degeneracy of the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.120
 retina at the age of 40 in one year and 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.750
 Well, I saw more 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 so when that happened to me 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.900
 well i said well i'm i 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.680
 am this damned for all in all I could 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.569
 do nothing 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:42.250
 nothing more to do at all and thanks to this 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:45.669
 went to school I had a dog and the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.290
 dog really gave me so much at 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.419
 mental point of view 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.299
 in short because when it happens to us 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:58.180
 we take a big hit in the 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:00.280
 career so the dog is really at 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.780
 At first I was in the can but the can is 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.469
 well it's very nice I do not want 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.919
 denigrate which mel to keynes and one 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:13.840
 feel all the others all the obstacles 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:16.570
 and fit with with the dog one does not 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.579
 absolutely absolutely no longer 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.430
 barriers 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.789
 if there is a stool if there is anything 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.860
 this is a chair the dog is going to be doing 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.330
 go away we will follow 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.600
 we will follow the dog since 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.600
 this is my third dog and with 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.290
 three dogs I have never taken 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.320
 hillside the amber sidewalk our you 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.220
 be careful it still gives a 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.070
 security an independence it's up to 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.580
 to say we do not have to ask stone 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.270
 paul jacques if he is what you want 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.060
 go out with me take me that's really 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.560
 it's really a 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.490
 it's a second life it's a 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.290
 Renaissance 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.930
 the dog feels for example when we 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.240
 we are not good 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:16.060
 for example well we feel we 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.800
 feels that the dog the dog lists 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:24.180
 is this little 107 sensitivity if we 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.830
 can say gently 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.570
 he is part of the family like me 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.020
 I try her hands it's my little 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.750
 last what's really hard is 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.540
 when when you lose your laggard dog 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.790
 it's really a disaster 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.640
 it's a wedding in short a little bit 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.500
 something close as I say I have 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.500
 two darlings I have my wife and my dog
