think the president should get involved

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.939 
think the president should get involved
I<00:01:01.250> think<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.989> certain<00:01:04.530> chain<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I think they have a certain chain of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.170 
I think they have a certain chain of
command<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.970> follow

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
command that you have to follow

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.289 
command that you have to follow
different<00:01:06.990> courts<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> go

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
different courts that you have to go

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
different courts that you have to go
through<00:01:09.540> if<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.869> level<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> court<00:01:10.530> don't<00:01:10.740> work

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
through if one level of court don't work

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.320 
through if one level of court don't work
then<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> next<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> court

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
then you go to the next level of court

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.440 
then you go to the next level of court
okay<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> president<00:01:14.909> should<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.240> involved

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
okay the president should get involved

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
okay the president should get involved

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.069 
see so he's a hypocrite man and he don't
like<00:04:19.859> black<00:04:20.250> folk<00:04:20.549> should<00:04:21.299> he<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.539> involved

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079
