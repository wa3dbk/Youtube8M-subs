about<00:00:43.200> HDR<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.440> concept<00:00:44.890> of<00:00:44.980> merging<00:00:45.400> a

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
about HDR the concept of merging a

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.640 
about HDR the concept of merging a

soft and you'll notice that if you go to
the<00:01:40.750> HDR<00:01:41.200> soft<00:01:41.560> wet<00:01:41.829> side<00:01:42.100> they<00:01:42.609> do<00:01:42.850> have<00:01:43.060> an

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
the HDR soft wet side they do have an

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.120 
the HDR soft wet side they do have an
option<00:01:43.359> now<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.869> be<00:01:44.229> able<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.530> create<00:01:44.710> an

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.760 
on how to be able to use the plug-in
itself<00:01:55.359> so<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:55.840> don't<00:01:56.020> necessarily<00:01:56.469> want<00:01:56.710> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
itself so I don't necessarily want to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.590 
itself so I don't necessarily want to
worry<00:01:56.920> about<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.189> too<00:01:57.549> much<00:01:57.579> because<00:01:58.479> you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
worry about that too much because you

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.969 
worry about that too much because you
know<00:01:58.719> what<00:01:58.869> it's<00:01:59.200> actually<00:01:59.380> very<00:01:59.619> very

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
know what it's actually very very

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.060 
know what it's actually very very

photomatix now and instead of photomatix

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.300 
photomatix now and instead of photomatix
that's<00:03:35.840> processing<00:03:36.470> all<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.620> these<00:03:36.860> images

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.050 
that's processing all of these images
and<00:03:38.230> once<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.410> get<00:03:39.590> inside<00:03:39.739> of<00:03:40.130> here<00:03:40.430> you'll

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
notice that it also does some aligning

notice that it also does some aligning
of<00:03:43.580> source<00:03:43.790> images<00:03:44.269> which<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> great<00:03:45.140> thing

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
of source images which is a great thing

allows<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.379> be<00:04:07.530> able<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.860> create<00:04:08.069> that

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
allows you to be able to create that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.089 
allows you to be able to create that
specific<00:04:09.209> effect<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.599> you'd<00:04:09.720> like<00:04:09.930> based<00:04:10.830> a

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
specific effect that you'd like based a

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.080 
specific effect that you'd like based a
lot<00:04:11.819> on<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.750> overall<00:04:13.080> strength<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.090> most

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
lot on the overall strength and most

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.060 
lot on the overall strength and most
specifically<00:04:15.659> the<00:04:16.229> light<00:04:16.440> smoothing<00:04:16.889> on<00:04:16.979> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
specifically the light smoothing on the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.340 
specifically the light smoothing on the
image<00:04:17.340> notice<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.780> play<00:04:19.019> with<00:04:19.199> these

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
image notice that as you play with these

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.140 
image notice that as you play with these
different<00:04:19.739> settings<00:04:20.070> you'll<00:04:20.790> start<00:04:21.120> getting

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
different settings you'll start getting

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.360 
different settings you'll start getting
different<00:04:21.720> effects<00:04:22.109> now<00:04:22.440> there's<00:04:22.680> tons<00:04:23.220> of

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
different effects now there's tons of

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.250 
different effects now there's tons of
courses<00:04:23.820> out<00:04:23.970> there<00:04:24.000> then<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:25.110> take<00:04:25.199> a

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
courses out there then you can take a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.860 
courses out there then you can take a
look<00:04:25.470> at<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:26.220> be<00:04:26.400> able<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.910> kind<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.419> get<00:04:27.660> this

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
look at to be able to kind of get this

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.450 
look at to be able to kind of get this
but<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.020> really<00:04:31.350> do<00:04:31.470> tell<00:04:31.620> people<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:32.040> a<00:04:32.190> lot

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
of the times it is a question of just

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.200 
of the times it is a question of just
kind<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.500> playing<00:04:34.800> around<00:04:35.040> with<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:36.180> settings

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
kind of playing around with the settings

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.969 
kind of playing around with the settings
until<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:36.930> find<00:04:37.169> something<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.560> you're

how to be able to use this that we can
do<00:05:01.979> another<00:05:02.190> time<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:03.389> this<00:05:04.260> one<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.590> more

to<00:05:06.270> be<00:05:06.449> able<00:05:06.539> to<00:05:06.690> process<00:05:06.990> all<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.380> this<00:05:07.530> stuff

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
to be able to process all of this stuff

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.770 
to be able to process all of this stuff
and<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.430> benefits<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.910> being<00:05:09.090> able<00:05:09.419> to<00:05:09.510> do<00:05:09.630> all

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
and the benefits of being able to do all

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.690 
and the benefits of being able to do all
of<00:05:09.810> that<00:05:09.960> stuff<00:05:10.200> in<00:05:10.380> photomatix<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.280> more

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
of that stuff in photomatix and more

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.029 
of that stuff in photomatix and more
importantly<00:05:12.240> getting<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.169> right<00:05:13.440> back<00:05:13.740> into

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
importantly getting that right back into

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.120 
importantly getting that right back into
Lightroom<00:05:14.700> right<00:05:15.450> because<00:05:15.720> now<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.260> processes

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
Lightroom right because now it processes

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.190 
Lightroom right because now it processes
all<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.370> that<00:05:17.490> stuff<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:18.030> takes<00:05:18.539> care<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:18.930> all

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
all of that stuff it takes care of all

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.980 
all of that stuff it takes care of all
of<00:05:19.229> it<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.669> once<00:05:20.669> all<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.479> tone<00:05:21.720> mapping

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
of it and once all of the tone mapping

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.450 
of it and once all of the tone mapping
is<00:05:22.260> done<00:05:22.289> for<00:05:23.250> those<00:05:23.490> images<00:05:25.190> you'll<00:05:26.190> notice

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
is done for those images you'll notice

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.870 
is done for those images you'll notice
that<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:27.419> image<00:05:27.840> now<00:05:28.110> sits<00:05:28.680> inside<00:05:28.979> of<00:05:29.760> your

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
that that image now sits inside of your

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.170 
that that image now sits inside of your
Lightroom<00:05:30.150> catalog<00:05:30.840> but<00:05:31.500> here's<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.830> problem

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
Lightroom catalog but here's the problem

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.990 
Lightroom catalog but here's the problem
right<00:05:33.180> when<00:05:33.479> we<00:05:33.630> created<00:05:34.139> this<00:05:34.500> we<00:05:35.370> created

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
right when we created this we created

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.550 
right when we created this we created
this<00:05:36.150> off<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:37.139> our<00:05:37.620> panel<00:05:38.370> folder<00:05:38.789> i<00:05:39.289> made<00:05:40.289> this

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
this off of our panel folder i made this

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.920 
this off of our panel folder i made this
in<00:05:41.060> here<00:05:43.340> but<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.490> image<00:05:44.789> is<00:05:45.120> not<00:05:45.330> in<00:05:45.510> here<00:05:45.780> it

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
in here but that image is not in here it

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.390 
in here but that image is not in here it
doesn't<00:05:46.080> reimport<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:47.070> into<00:05:47.310> the

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
doesn't reimport that into the

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.980 
doesn't reimport that into the
collection<00:05:47.699> so<00:05:48.389> I<00:05:48.419> think<00:05:48.599> that<00:05:48.870> that's

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
collection so I think that that's

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.719 
collection so I think that that's
something<00:05:49.919> that's<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.250> little<00:05:50.370> bit<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.669> a

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
something that's a little bit of a

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.800 
something that's a little bit of a
problem<00:05:51.680> instead<00:05:52.680> it<00:05:53.039> puts<00:05:53.610> it<00:05:53.849> into<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.599> all

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
problem instead it puts it into the all

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.719 
problem instead it puts it into the all
picture<00:05:55.470> section<00:05:55.889> right<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.190> just<00:05:56.220> dumps<00:05:56.639> it

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
picture section right it just dumps it

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.140 
picture section right it just dumps it
into<00:05:56.849> the<00:05:57.030> catalog<00:05:57.479> right<00:05:58.199> here<00:05:58.470> at<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.650> end

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
into the catalog right here at the end
