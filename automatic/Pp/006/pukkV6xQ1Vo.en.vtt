know every second of it from the first
of<00:04:48.220> all<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.370> ever<00:04:48.490> had<00:04:48.880> say<00:04:49.060> well<00:04:49.210> personalities

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
of all I ever had say well personalities

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.390 
of all I ever had say well personalities
and<00:04:50.350> our<00:04:50.440> attitudes<00:04:50.860> were<00:04:51.040> certainly

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
and our attitudes were certainly

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.180 
and our attitudes were certainly
different<00:04:51.760> but<00:04:52.510> his<00:04:52.960> game<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.830> what<00:04:54.010> he

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
different but his game and and what he

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.980 
different but his game and and what he
brought<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:55.120> courts<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.600> so<00:04:55.750> forth

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
brought to the courts and so forth

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.719 
brought to the courts and so forth
certainly<00:04:56.380> was<00:04:56.530> something<00:04:56.740> special<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.669> it

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
certainly was something special and it

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.159 
certainly was something special and it
was<00:04:57.850> necessarily<00:04:58.390> because<00:04:58.780> we<00:04:58.990> needed

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
was necessarily because we needed

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.560 
was necessarily because we needed
somebody<00:04:59.470> after<00:04:59.950> my<00:05:00.070> era<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.669> really<00:05:01.180> take<00:05:01.390> the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
somebody after my era to really take the

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
and anguish and maybe it comes from the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.130 
and anguish and maybe it comes from the
fact<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.910> his<00:05:10.060> father<00:05:10.090> forced<00:05:10.750> him<00:05:10.840> on<00:05:10.990> him
