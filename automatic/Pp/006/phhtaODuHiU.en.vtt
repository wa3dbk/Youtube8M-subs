vs protoss record this is so

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
vs protoss record this is so
ridiculously<00:01:16.110> one-sided<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.979> try<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> be

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
ridiculously one-sided I try not to be

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
ridiculously one-sided I try not to be
biased<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.170> there's<00:01:19.710> no

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
biased in these things but there's no

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
biased in these things but there's no
way<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.520> music<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> win<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.830> but

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
way that music is going to win this but

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
way that music is going to win this but
I<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> will<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.430> fun<00:01:23.640> seeing<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.119> July

see exactly what music is up to when he

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.089 
see exactly what music is up to when he
either<00:02:20.060> plops<00:02:20.629> down<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.110> fort<00:02:21.410> fast<00:02:21.680> expand

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
either plops down the fort fast expand

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.610 
either plops down the fort fast expand
or<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> gateway<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.849> whatever<00:02:23.500> sending<00:02:24.500> down

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
or a gateway or whatever sending down

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.370 
or a gateway or whatever sending down
that<00:02:24.769> probe<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.459> think<00:02:26.300> yeah<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:26.959> is<00:02:27.080> going<00:02:27.290> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
that probe I think yeah this is going to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.680 
that probe I think yeah this is going to
be<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.680> gateway<00:02:27.920> build<00:02:28.430> since<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.150> pylon<00:02:29.510> is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
be a gateway build since that pylon is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.539 
be a gateway build since that pylon is
not<00:02:29.989> down<00:02:30.260> by<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.560> natural<00:02:30.860> expansion<00:02:31.370> oh

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
not down by the natural expansion oh

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.410 
not down by the natural expansion oh
yeah<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.580> was<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.000> do<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> shout-out

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.770 
down a nexus anytime soon it looked like
that's<00:04:52.639> exactly<00:04:53.120> what<00:04:53.330> he's<00:04:53.419> going<00:04:53.599> to<00:04:53.629> do

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
that's exactly what he's going to do

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.600 
that's exactly what he's going to do
here<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.530> he<00:04:54.680> still<00:04:54.889> has<00:04:55.009> the<00:04:55.099> Overlord<00:04:55.490> in

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.309 
here and he still has the Overlord in
here<00:04:55.789> so<00:04:55.940> he<00:04:56.030> knows<00:04:56.180> what<00:04:56.629> tech<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.050> going<00:04:57.229> to

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319 
here so he knows what tech is going to

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.050 
here so he knows what tech is going to
be<00:04:57.409> coming<00:04:57.560> up<00:04:57.800> there's<00:04:58.490> some<00:04:58.669> girls<00:04:58.879> hunting

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
but okay Luke he put down a cybernetic

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.860 
but okay Luke he put down a cybernetic
scores<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:11.090> i<00:05:11.150> assume<00:05:11.479> he's<00:05:11.509> going<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:13.479> go<00:05:14.479> for

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
running around just trying to make sure

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.119 
running around just trying to make sure
there<00:05:34.849> aren't<00:05:34.969> any<00:05:35.229> pylons<00:05:36.229> around<00:05:36.589> that<00:05:37.039> he

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
there aren't any pylons around that he

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.779 
there aren't any pylons around that he
could<00:05:37.279> take<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:38.110> July<00:05:39.110> is<00:05:39.139> running<00:05:39.469> Izzard

circling around trying to look for a
proxy<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:42.680> think<00:05:43.039> just<00:05:43.610> going<00:05:43.879> to<00:05:44.000> make<00:05:44.150> sure

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
proxy I think just going to make sure

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.629 
proxy I think just going to make sure
because<00:05:44.659> he<00:05:44.750> can't<00:05:45.259> get<00:05:45.409> a<00:05:45.469> full<00:05:45.860> scout<00:05:46.219> really

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
because he can't get a full scout really

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.990 
because he can't get a full scout really
of<00:05:46.789> the<00:05:47.449> base<00:05:47.629> once<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.639> Corsairs<00:05:49.639> come<00:05:49.879> out

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
of the base once the Corsairs come out

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.540

den so he's going to I assume get the

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.209 
den so he's going to I assume get the

hydrilla stand and the spire up and then

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:06.189 
hydrilla stand and the spire up and then
