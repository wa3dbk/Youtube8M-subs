00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.990
 good morning this is a message to 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.929
 all those people who are 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.910
 distressed that are worried with 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.500
 a situation that seems not to 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.439
 there is health that does not have any kind of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.140
 hope and that's why today I come from part 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.730
 of God to give you this message if it is not 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.310
 coincidence that you are watching this video 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.740
 if not, God has a solution 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.860
 has an exit legs of voice problems 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.890
 are happening 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.580
 it seems that things are not changing 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 that everything will end but God has 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.000
 commanded 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.340
 so that he receives freedom just 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.490
 peace that you need and the subject that I'm going to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 to talk today is how to have peace jobs 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.180
 the addiction fires of l'alfÃ s 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.420
 when one is worried how to have 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.670
 peace when 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.940
 with a very soft friction and pain in 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.859
 your heart 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 and for that we're going to talk about the bible 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.770
 word of God 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.030
 is the instruction manual god not 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.030
 here on the legs so we can 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.290
 so we can talk to our 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 dining the word of them says 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.270
 philip then 46 says for nothing are you 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.120
 busy day 6 worried if not 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.950
 your requests are known in front of 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.380
 god with thanksgiving 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.060
 many times we drown in a glass of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.650
 water our worries are so 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.050
 big ones that do not 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.550
 we do not have time to ask God 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.410
 cast 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.030
 if we say that God wants us to pray 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.530
 let's just do a prayer 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.549
 delivering on that concern 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.740
 now show them how can I make a 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.260
 prayer that costs me 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.220
 this situation surpasses me 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.650
 and the answer is simple simply 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.670
 says the word god believes in the Lord 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.580
 jesus if you're the one who died on the cross 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.140
 says that he died on the cross carrying 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.239
 all our sins of our 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.650
 rebellions our doctors our 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.930
 diseases 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 he is the envoy of god jesus christ is 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.420
 the son of 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.950
 and it also says the word of God in 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.500
 John 14 36 says Jesus said I am the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.069
 I walk the truth and life nobody who 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.580
 comes to the father but for me 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.700
 that's why today you do not need them 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.790
 and in this difficult situation simply 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.970
 I think cut for your life and also 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.850
 I want you to receive Jesus in your heart 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.580
 because he is the only way to father 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.570
 you are the way the truth and the life 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.370
 there is no religion nor do I believe any 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.660
 human philosophy that you can take to 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.880
 god alone 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 only Jesus Christ who is he 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.150

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.940
 that God sent to this earth 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.130
 truly and he is the only one who died 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.980
 on the cross for you and that god resurrected him 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.410
 and because of that he raised and he is
