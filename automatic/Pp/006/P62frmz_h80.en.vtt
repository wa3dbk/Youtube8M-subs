00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
important because you can have

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
important because you can have
stunning-looking<00:01:40.829> cakes<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.670> i'm<00:01:42.119> watching

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
stunning-looking cakes and i'm watching

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.999 
stunning-looking cakes and i'm watching
the<00:01:42.509> ingredients<00:01:42.990> inside<00:01:43.229> maybe<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the ingredients inside maybe not the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
the ingredients inside maybe not the
best<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.549> they'll<00:01:44.820> taste<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> cardboard

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
best and they'll taste like cardboard

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
best and they'll taste like cardboard
and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> cake<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> be

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and I think the cake is going to be

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.350
