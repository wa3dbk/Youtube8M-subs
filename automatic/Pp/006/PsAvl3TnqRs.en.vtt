00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.980
 Hello dear friends with you Goodwin 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 64 today I want to show you the warriors 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 american middle tank 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.180
 level five m4 sherman o tank pretty 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 still not new i would even say very 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 old and of course i won't you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.260
 talk about how to play it or 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 Something in this spirit I want to tell you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.510
 about actually speaking why 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.449
 file Serb got to this machine 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 Well, probably it is no secret to anyone that 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.989
 us in the game there are a lot of sand them 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.750
 and actually sherman is one of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.629
 those of them in what is actually 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.909
 imbalance of this tank as a whole 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.460
 so pretty big in her not not 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.390
 the very best let's say the dynamics 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 although he is pretty good but him 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.830
 It has good angles and aiming Well in 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.430
 him actually not so what is he 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 out of the total number of other machines 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.350
 and the fact that he has such here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.899
 can actually speaking with which I 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.680
 now collecting kitty is 105 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.369
 millimeters 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.549
 has wonderful land mines ki with damage in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.250
 410 and cumulative 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.859
 Of course, cumulative in one of the past 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.689
 fix the waltz cut the puncture and not 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.520
 began to punch much worse there about 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.260
 a hundred miles not 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.140
 here but the cannon is fucking exactly on 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.810
 land mines see one just shots 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.900
 your adversary is either vanishhot or even 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.030
 just go to the hangar 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.220
 here is of course such a tool need to somehow 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.650
 perry balance when balancing 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 that she we just well very god and many 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.140
 many low level tanks just you 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.270
 can pick one shot tanks 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 your level you can also pick up 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.600
 again shot if of course it comes across 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.920
 there is of course enough such a factor 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.869
 the fact that quite a long time comes down 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.570
 gun a landmine still not always 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.370
 sometimes the garden is punched by someone 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.860
 It turns out but childhood they punch 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.000
 the author says they are pretty often 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.980
 what exactly happens is what I do 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.830
 talked about going vanshot and even if you 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.959
 not with your opponent's vanshotili then you 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.900
 they gave him everything just 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.400
 crew members there are contused pile 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.080
 modules immediately become unusable 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.810
 this gun is real god and therefore 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.930
 that's why no more 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.269
 adventures 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.819
 decided a little perry balance but true 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.230
 there is so insignificant nerve to me 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.730
 It seems it will not affect it at all 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.310
 the gameplay on this machine that is there on 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.609
 one second in my increased from 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.489
 recharge time and color taught 02 by 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.500
 my increased speed of information is 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.280
 Of course, it is unlikely to be able to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 affect I think that there as a move 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.519
 the hospital will bend it and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.629
 absolutely calm the whole thing is in 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.930
 this gun another question is that on 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.220
 this kind still need to be able to play and know 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.349
 where better to shoot who is better to shoot 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.299
 knows what is wrong with this instrument 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.129
 just get out not some kind of approximate 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.629
 opponent dice shoot 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.150
 because he'll just figure it out 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.950
 for example, I never would have left 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.469
 here on this tank so here in impudent 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.530
 bow shoot from 34 because on 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:45.579
 so you t t p m that she just once 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.049
 picking you to pieces here not to 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.030
 Sorry got caught on pretty 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.080
 nasty trophy to anyone 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.700
 I can't punch him immediately his forehead 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.300
 Sorry, though I did not warm it threw it straight 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.900
 cool and this of course the pain is true 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.850
 you went to the hangar already collects your 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.600
 blow to a piece well actually 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.830
 heal your farts who 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.160
 chair burner too on 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.230
 this time but actually fight 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.060
 coming to the end I neatly due 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.739
 corners aiming shoot off of course with 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.269
 such opponents sell candles 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.570
 shoot because he has again 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.450
 dpm and accuracy for much better 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.430
 the way to me also sends art but so you 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.060
 see effortlessly this is a tank 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.430
 thickness he drags random it is certainly not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.120
 the best combat on this tank I 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.350
 just do one of the last 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.170
 so far the action was not needed only 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.220
 a bit all nations i took pershing this 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.620
 super 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.220
 which in fact is not so 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.460
 supersky height freebie shorter aim 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.610
 his got him playing this car after 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.530
 75 thousand experience I earned it on 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.430
 little just you just him 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.990
 delicious 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.610
 Sherman is just awesome 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.030
 actually on this i think that 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.670
 You can finish the description of this tank 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.430
 because he's just gorgeous here 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.980
 Naturally, the last art is already finished 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.480
 without me, I won't find her yukata insolently 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.970
 the base 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.240
 Well, that's actually what I mean 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.040
 said it just fiercely for how are you 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.080
 I can notice this war 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.560
 well what did I do supernatural 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.810
 but the master is steel 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.180
 wall main caliber you 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.650
 over the plant with my friend 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.870
 clan members so we still have the courage to 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.650
 practice brothers in arms 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.930
 but 1700 damage without straining 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.950
 well what other five can give out 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:58.000
 such types but perhaps 34 is also 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:00.730
 a kind of imba here farms tank 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.700
 fine that is if you don't have right 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.620
 you can get in this car and drive 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.070
 on not even the next patch 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.600
 let it be just a little longer 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.880
 come down a little bit longer 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.419
 recharge but you can 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.919
 vanshoty all their classmates 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:22.900
 almost everything and below its level 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.450
 I think a great car here experienced 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.450
 astronomical course of 1700 only 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.610
 but nevertheless it was very pleasant 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.370
 on it stop i recommend it to you 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.220
 the car must have itself in the hangar 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.070
 I will not sell it by any means 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.250
 the fact that such things need to save it 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.500
 just adorable well hope you 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.020

 more videos on 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.319
 American tank I do not remember how he 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.380
 exactly called which is issued for the world
