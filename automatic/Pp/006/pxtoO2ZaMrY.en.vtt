00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
powder really just gave it a kick and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670

brought<00:01:14.370> out<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> flavor<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.530> going

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
brought out a lot of flavor so I'm going

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:30.499

to<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:18.470> chili<00:01:19.470> powder<00:01:21.200> horse<00:01:22.880> essence

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130 

and<00:01:31.509> I<00:01:31.930> found<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.240> add<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.630> oils<00:01:34.990> in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
and I found that if you add the oils in

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.870 
and I found that if you add the oils in
first<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:36.610> really<00:01:36.850> coats<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.420> meat<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.880> that's

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
first it really coats the meat so that's

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.580 
first it really coats the meat so that's
the<00:01:39.970> way<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:40.180> they<00:01:40.479> like<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.840> do<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.229> these

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the way that they like to do this these

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.010 
the way that they like to do this these
are<00:01:41.710> red<00:01:41.890> peppers<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.789> actually<00:01:43.390> bought

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and then blended into crushed red pepper

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.469 
and then blended into crushed red pepper
and<00:01:47.439> then<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.649> put<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.039> in<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.700> container<00:01:48.939> so

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
usually what I do is I just try to

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.160

separate<00:07:02.550> and<00:07:02.820> create<00:07:03.450> like<00:07:03.720> a<00:07:03.750> little

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
separate and create like a little

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.470

barrier<00:07:05.160> between<00:07:05.370> what<00:07:05.820> I'm<00:07:05.910> doing<00:07:06.300> because

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480
