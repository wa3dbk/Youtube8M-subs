these<00:00:07.370> are<00:00:07.520> my<00:00:07.609> two<00:00:07.670> favorite<00:00:08.210> uses<00:00:08.389> for<00:00:08.809> the

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
these are my two favorite uses for the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.600 
these are my two favorite uses for the
boilie<00:00:09.230> funnel<00:00:09.559> web<00:00:09.710> which<00:00:09.860> is<00:00:10.010> the<00:00:10.130> medium

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
boilie funnel web which is the medium

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.610 
boilie funnel web which is the medium
size<00:00:10.910> of<00:00:11.090> funnel<00:00:11.360> web<00:00:11.510> you<00:00:12.020> know<00:00:12.139> it's<00:00:12.320> boilie

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
size of funnel web you know it's boilie

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.570 
size of funnel web you know it's boilie
obviously<00:00:12.889> because<00:00:13.039> it<00:00:13.100> says<00:00:13.309> it<00:00:13.430> on<00:00:13.459> the

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
obviously because it says it on the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.250 
obviously because it says it on the
label<00:00:13.910> but<00:00:13.940> also<00:00:14.180> because<00:00:14.539> it's<00:00:14.750> got<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:14.930> green

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
label but also because it's got a green

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.980 
label but also because it's got a green
flash<00:00:15.709> there<00:00:16.670> on<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.150> label<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.750> we've

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
flash there on the label and we've

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.950 
flash there on the label and we've
matched<00:00:18.770> up<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:19.550> refills<00:00:20.060> to<00:00:20.240> go<00:00:20.390> with<00:00:20.600> it<00:00:20.630> so

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
matched up the refills to go with it so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.300 
matched up the refills to go with it so
you've<00:00:21.080> got<00:00:21.109> a<00:00:21.230> green<00:00:21.529> flesh<00:00:21.859> on<00:00:22.070> there

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
you've got a green flesh on there

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.189 
you've got a green flesh on there
there's<00:00:22.519> a<00:00:22.580> hex<00:00:22.759> mesh<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:23.300> a<00:00:23.660> micro<00:00:24.050> mesh

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
there's a hex mesh and a micro mesh

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.380 
there's a hex mesh and a micro mesh
refill<00:00:24.650> for<00:00:24.830> these<00:00:25.009> and<00:00:25.699> they<00:00:25.849> both<00:00:26.029> coming

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
refill for these and they both coming

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.800 
refill for these and they both coming
over<00:00:26.630> 5<00:00:26.839> meters<00:00:27.439> or<00:00:27.619> 20<00:00:28.039> meters<00:00:28.339> on<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.490> spool<00:00:28.849> so

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
over 5 meters or 20 meters on a spool so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.019 
over 5 meters or 20 meters on a spool so
basically<00:00:30.710> system<00:00:31.099> comes<00:00:31.310> in<00:00:31.429> a<00:00:31.490> protected

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
basically system comes in a protected

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.720 
basically system comes in a protected
cover<00:00:32.710> inside<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:34.010> if<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.310> haven't<00:00:34.520> seen<00:00:34.670> it

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
cover inside it if you haven't seen it

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.670 
cover inside it if you haven't seen it
before<00:00:35.150> you've<00:00:35.360> got<00:00:35.390> your<00:00:35.600> PV<00:00:35.930> I<00:00:35.960> on<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.560> inner

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
before you've got your PV I on the inner

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.580 
before you've got your PV I on the inner
tube<00:00:37.039> and<00:00:37.340> then<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:37.850> compressor<00:00:38.420> as<00:00:38.570> well<00:00:38.780> now

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
tube and then the compressor as well now

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.110 
tube and then the compressor as well now
the<00:00:39.649> first<00:00:39.920> use<00:00:40.340> was<00:00:40.730> what<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.000> originally

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the first use was what we originally

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.840 
the first use was what we originally
designed<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.649> boilie<00:00:42.949> funnel<00:00:43.250> web<00:00:43.370> for<00:00:43.609> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
designed the boilie funnel web for and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.000 
designed the boilie funnel web for and
obviously<00:00:44.180> as<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:44.420> name<00:00:44.600> suggests<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.289> was

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
obviously as the name suggests that was

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.819 
obviously as the name suggests that was
boilies<00:00:46.460> i've<00:00:47.059> got<00:00:47.210> on<00:00:47.329> there<00:00:47.600> he's<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.559> very

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
boilies i've got on there he's a very

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.069 
boilies i've got on there he's a very
very<00:00:49.039> clever<00:00:49.280> stringer<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.750> what<00:00:50.960> we've

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
very clever stringer so what we've

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.380 
very clever stringer so what we've
basically<00:00:51.289> done<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:51.949> put<00:00:52.129> three<00:00:52.399> baits<00:00:52.640> down

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
basically done we put three baits down

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.299 
basically done we put three baits down
the<00:00:53.600> inner<00:00:53.719> tube<00:00:54.079> push<00:00:54.769> them<00:00:54.980> down<00:00:55.010> with<00:00:55.250> a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
the inner tube push them down with a

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.889 
the inner tube push them down with a
compressor<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:55.879> out<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.149> other<00:00:56.179> end<00:00:56.510> and

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
compressor and out the other end and

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.540 
compressor and out the other end and
before<00:00:57.410> I've<00:00:57.559> tied<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.949> simple<00:00:58.309> overhand

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
before I've tied the simple overhand

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.669 
before I've tied the simple overhand
knot<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.510> lock<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.929> top<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:00.320> PVA

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
knot to lock the top of that PVA

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.619 
knot to lock the top of that PVA
together<00:01:01.129> I've<00:01:01.609> basically<00:01:01.969> pushed<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
together I've basically pushed the

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.070 
together I've basically pushed the
boilies<00:01:03.109> out<00:01:03.410> of<00:01:03.739> sync<00:01:04.070> like<00:01:04.910> that<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.930> that

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
boilies out of sync like that so that

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.140 
boilies out of sync like that so that
when<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:06.230> push<00:01:06.500> them<00:01:06.620> back<00:01:06.740> together<00:01:06.950> again<00:01:07.310> it

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
when I push them back together again it

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.520 
when I push them back together again it
puts<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.540> boilies<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.110> they're<00:01:09.230> even<00:01:09.500> more

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
puts the boilies and they're even more

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.460 
puts the boilies and they're even more
tension<00:01:10.360> then<00:01:11.360> I'll<00:01:11.510> tie<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.690> knot<00:01:12.020> making

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
tension then I'll tie the knot making

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.690 
tension then I'll tie the knot making
sure<00:01:12.500> everything's<00:01:12.950> nice<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.160> tight<00:01:13.490> a

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
sure everything's nice and tight a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.130 
sure everything's nice and tight a
second<00:01:14.150> not<00:01:14.300> as<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.540> always<00:01:14.660> do<00:01:14.930> on<00:01:15.050> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
second not as you always do on the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.720 
second not as you always do on the
funnel<00:01:15.380> web<00:01:15.500> systems<00:01:15.890> cut<00:01:16.100> between<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.520> two

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
funnel web systems cut between the two

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.870 
funnel web systems cut between the two
and<00:01:16.970> your<00:01:17.360> systems<00:01:17.720> ready<00:01:17.900> for<00:01:18.140> another<00:01:18.290> go

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
and your systems ready for another go

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.370 
and your systems ready for another go
then<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.000> PVA<00:01:20.330> string<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.720> actually<00:01:21.020> finished

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
then the PVA string is actually finished

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.350 
then the PVA string is actually finished
so<00:01:21.530> what<00:01:21.650> I've<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:21.920> done<00:01:22.160> is<00:01:22.640> put<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.030> needle

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
so what I've then done is put the needle

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.180 
so what I've then done is put the needle
through<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.900> top<00:01:24.260> boilie<00:01:24.650> i've<00:01:24.740> used<00:01:24.920> one<00:01:25.160> of

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
through the top boilie i've used one of

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.280 
through the top boilie i've used one of
these<00:01:25.340> heavy<00:01:25.640> gate<00:01:25.940> latch<00:01:26.180> needles<00:01:26.720> let's

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
these heavy gate latch needles let's

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.320 
these heavy gate latch needles let's
gone<00:01:27.470> through<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.860> top<00:01:28.040> boilie<00:01:28.460> pulled<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
gone through the top boilie pulled the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.390 
gone through the top boilie pulled the
hair<00:01:29.510> back<00:01:29.750> through<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.800> there<00:01:31.070> i'll<00:01:31.190> put

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
hair back through and it there i'll put

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400 
hair back through and it there i'll put
the<00:01:31.460> hair<00:01:31.640> stop<00:01:31.940> in<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.780> stop<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.020> boilie

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
the hair stop in to stop the boilie

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.830 
the hair stop in to stop the boilie
getting<00:01:33.680> off<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.940> one's<00:01:35.330> permanently

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
getting off so that one's permanently

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.300 
getting off so that one's permanently
attached<00:01:36.200> that's<00:01:36.440> on<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.770> hair<00:01:36.980> but<00:01:37.220> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
attached that's on the hair but the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.740 
attached that's on the hair but the
other<00:01:37.430> two<00:01:37.640> obviously<00:01:38.120> are<00:01:38.210> not<00:01:38.390> their<00:01:38.630> only

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
other two obviously are not their only

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.380 
other two obviously are not their only
attached<00:01:39.110> via<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.500> pvi<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.610> when<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.940> melts

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
can see there that would normally be a

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.050 
can see there that would normally be a
bit<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.989> pepper<00:03:32.139> army<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.739> there<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.970> we
