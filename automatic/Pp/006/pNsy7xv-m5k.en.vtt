00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone with you oh great good 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 to my channel today i will show 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.309
 you an image that was inspired by 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.309
 watching a movie maze of faun 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.740
 first we take the darkest tone 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.790
 tonal framework and apply a dense layer 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.790
 on face and neck 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 then take concealer to tone darker and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.509
 we begin to sculpture the face select 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.580
 cheekbones delineating the hollows of the cheeks darken 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.110
 chin area 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.690
 compete eyebrows apply color along the edges 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.699
 nose and finally stand out the back of your head 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 in a semicircle, I take the primer to tone 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.760
 lighter and apply to areas untouched 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760
 concealer 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.730
 we fix the whole thing matiruyuschey 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730
 powder 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 now we proceed directly to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.910
 intensive contouring 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.980
 brush the product over the top 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.640
 concealer making the shadows even more 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.640
 obvious 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.800
 With a smaller brush, I create the illusion 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.110
 almond eyes eyes externally 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.080
 and the inner corners of the eyes also 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.550
 obscure the tip of the nose 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.590
 next you need a white pencil 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.800
 which we draw spirals on 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.800
 forehead 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.030
 to work with spirals to us 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.990
 need a face painting brown 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.990
 outlines 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.920
 after the lightest tonal basis 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.920
 fill the gaps between the lines 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.550
 after you have finished filling out 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.500
 spirals pass the product on top of those 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.500
 areas where you applied the primer 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.760
 continue to work with shadows 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.130
 dark brown is almost grayish 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.330
 color start to put on top of aqua lines 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:32.640
 incidentally shading their completion 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.740
 fine brush again we pass xiao 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.380
 by make-up at this stage we change 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.290
 bite making corners of lips with sod Tomi 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.420
 as if eternal grins also obscure 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.480
 nasolabial fold it gives 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.340
 feeling fabulous character 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.680
 finally it's time to work your eyes 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.900
 all the same cappuccino shadows from mac i 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.450
 impose on the inner corner of the eye 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.300
 further brown pencil repeat 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.300
 contours making the cut even more obvious 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.560
 for the makeup I use 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.270
 light brown shadows on the mobile eyelid 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.520
 the shade is darker on the crease of the eyelid and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.700
 saturated dark on the outer corner 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.700
 eyes 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.989
 glue wild eyelashes of your choice 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.989
 I stopped at spider legs 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.020
 completion dim your nose pulling them 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.210
