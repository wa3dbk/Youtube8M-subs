00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.750
 and above 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 mark the relative this I think is 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.740
 excessively tiny we're going to be worth it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.700
 OK, this is the success in this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.320
 sense 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.320
 it's not worth anything, listen to me 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.789
 but to know it past 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.789
 in general and salvation 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.760
 very well 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:06.080
 or asked him asked he asked you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.080
 willy i'm go sister you 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.869
 on the right also seen 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.270
 man but you had the indicator of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.690
 overflow well and I get caught without giving 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.490
 count uncle I think I'm in the best 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.590
 site that is I think I will win this 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.039
 simply starting 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:42.140
 We trust that you're a goat that pringao 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:47.710
 he knows it, or where are you getting caught 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.710
 well 50 seconds to go after me 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.930
 but it will necessarily be giving something 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.930
 tomorrow he thinks that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 from the height of nowhere 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.500
 look at me from here 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.500
 where it was 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 the region where you are going 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.120
 that here you can yes but that's a 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.310
 little work more 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.069
 and I had to search around here when 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.069
 I was looking for the key 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100
 we can 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.560
 is following and now I can stay 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
 every race 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.060
 we are in your 22 boys 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.060
 and we are in all 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.980
 and not having put 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.769
 a correct

 the good thing about my mother where I am what 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.450
 well I did not say 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.680
