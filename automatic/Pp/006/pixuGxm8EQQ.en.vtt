00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.780 
this was a oh three gold wing that I was
a<00:02:44.360> nice<00:02:44.540> bike<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.440> tell<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.280> talk<00:02:46.490> about<00:02:46.640> a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
a nice bike but I tell you talk about a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.700 
a nice bike but I tell you talk about a
hot<00:02:47.180> bike<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.720> lot<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.990> heat<00:02:48.140> coming<00:02:48.470> up<00:02:48.560> from

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
hot bike a lot of heat coming up from

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.950 
hot bike a lot of heat coming up from
under<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:48.980> plastic<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.720> probably

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
under that plastic but this is probably

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.110 
under that plastic but this is probably
one<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:53.620> best<00:02:54.620> balanced<00:02:55.250> motorcycles<00:02:56.000> you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
one of the best balanced motorcycles you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.930 
one of the best balanced motorcycles you
could<00:02:56.300> ride<00:02:56.830> from<00:02:57.830> all<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.280> bikes<00:02:58.520> I've<00:02:58.730> been

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
could ride from all the bikes I've been

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.760 
could ride from all the bikes I've been
on<00:02:59.090> Japanese<00:02:59.600> bikes<00:02:59.900> tend<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> little

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
on Japanese bikes tend to be a little

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.910 
on Japanese bikes tend to be a little
top-heavy<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:03.020> don't<00:03:03.170> realize<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.650> until

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
top-heavy and you don't realize it until

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.530 
top-heavy and you don't realize it until
you<00:03:04.190> ride<00:03:04.400> one<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.670> these<00:03:04.910> things<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.510> looks

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
you ride one of these things it looks

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.400 
you ride one of these things it looks
big<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:07.310> handles<00:03:07.880> like<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.090> much<00:03:08.990> smaller

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
big but it handles like a much smaller

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.660 
big but it handles like a much smaller
motorcycle<00:03:11.800> I'll<00:03:12.800> let<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.160> hear<00:03:13.490> what<00:03:13.640> it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
motorcycle I'll let you hear what it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:49.440 
motorcycle I'll let you hear what it
sounds<00:03:14.150> like

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.110 

so<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.110> good<00:03:51.290> sounding<00:03:51.680> bike<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.190> draws<00:03:52.459> it

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
so it's a good sounding bike it draws it

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.590 
so it's a good sounding bike it draws it
draw<00:03:53.360> some<00:03:53.630> attention<00:03:54.580> not<00:03:55.580> just<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.270> sound

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
draw some attention not just the sound

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.780 
draw some attention not just the sound
but<00:03:57.050> it's<00:03:57.560> nice<00:03:57.770> to<00:03:57.800> have<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.100> bike<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.520> really

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
but it's nice to have a bike that really

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.290 
but it's nice to have a bike that really
stands<00:03:59.150> out<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:01.250> little<00:04:01.730> bit<00:04:02.060> different

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
stands out and a little bit different

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.920 
stands out and a little bit different
