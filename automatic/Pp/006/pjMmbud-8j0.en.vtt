00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.840
You see

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680
The world belongs to me

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.800
No matter what you do

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.500
Under the revolution

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.640
Standing still

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.080
And everything I need

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.680
Is all inside of me

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.540
Can you believe

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
I'm making history

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940
'Cause we all come from love

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.400
I see you cry

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.360
I know just how you feel

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.280
Don't give up

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.080
'Cause you are so strong girl

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.320
Nothing can really get you down

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.320
Wipe your eyes

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.300
Baby there's a world out there

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.063
Come with me

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.120
Take a deep breath now

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.420
and feel the sun

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.020
on your sweet face

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.860
'Cause living is a gift

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.300
And you are full of grace

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.000
I wanna hear you say

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.820
The world belongs to me

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.960
No matter what you do

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.520
Under the revolution

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.960
Standing still

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.200
And everything I need

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.040
Is all inside of me

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
Can you believe

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.360
I'm making history

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.300
You wanna know

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.340
If all of this struggling will ever end

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.080
I tell you something

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.760
Without the darkness

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.000
there would be no light

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.620
Like a seed becomes a tree

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.980
And the night becomes a day

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.960
Love will find a way

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.840
The world belongs to me

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.960
No matter what you do

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.500
Under the revolution

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.320

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.980
Is all inside of me

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420
And can you believe

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.960

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.020
No matter

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.120
No matter

00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:32.475
No matter

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.680
No matter

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.940
