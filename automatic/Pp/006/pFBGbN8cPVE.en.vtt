and<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:18.290> new<00:01:19.290> energy<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:21.150> question<00:01:21.600> is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and have new energy so the question is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
and have new energy so the question is
about<00:01:21.900> Europe<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> Japan<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:25.220> from

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
about Europe and Japan but I see from

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
about Europe and Japan but I see from
the<00:01:26.430> influence<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.540> show<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the influence of a show like that and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
the influence of a show like that and
wonderful<00:01:29.520> trees<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:31.280> respected<00:01:32.280> value<00:01:32.840> how

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
wonderful trees of respected value how

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
wonderful trees of respected value how
they<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.140> presented<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.890> both<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.520> United

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
they are presented in both the United

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.289 
they are presented in both the United

States and Europe and starting in United

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
States and Europe and starting in United
States<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.130> we<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.220> will<00:01:44.220> say

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
States I think we have a lot of will say

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.050 
States I think we have a lot of will say
catching<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.979> need<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.369> understanding

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
catching up or need a more understanding

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
catching up or need a more understanding
of<00:01:48.649> tree<00:01:49.649> design<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.930> being<00:01:51.930> pioneers<00:01:52.470> like

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
of tree design and being pioneers like

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.219 
of tree design and being pioneers like
any<00:01:53.369> country<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> world<00:01:55.610> Americans<00:01:57.229> want

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
any country in the world Americans want

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
any country in the world Americans want
to<00:01:58.439> duplicate<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.610> think<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.119> best<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
to duplicate what they think is best in

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.550 
to duplicate what they think is best in
trees<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> best<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.119> trees<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:04.259> not

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
trees and what is best in trees is not

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.080 
trees and what is best in trees is not
always<00:02:04.770> necessarily<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.030> art<00:02:06.360> artistic

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
always necessarily the art artistic

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.440 
always necessarily the art artistic
the<00:02:07.539> trees<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.590> historical<00:02:09.369> design<00:02:10.269> of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the trees but the historical design of

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.490 
the trees but the historical design of
trees<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:11.860> i<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:13.180> americans<00:02:14.019> have<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
trees and here i think americans have to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.300 
trees and here i think americans have to
catch<00:02:14.709> up<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.610> europe<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.330> think<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.680> swing<00:02:18.010> of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
catch up in europe I think the swing of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.800 
catch up in europe I think the swing of
design<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.239> trees<00:02:20.940> throughout<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.209> world<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
design of trees throughout the world and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.960 
design of trees throughout the world and
I<00:02:23.050> haven't<00:02:23.349> been<00:02:23.470> everywhere<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.310> open<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.790> in

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
I haven't been everywhere and open up in

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.770 
I haven't been everywhere and open up in
a<00:02:25.060> few<00:02:25.239> places<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:27.040> i<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.000> europeans

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
a few places but i think the europeans

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.530 
a few places but i think the europeans
are<00:02:29.400> leading<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.610> way<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:31.410> tree<00:02:32.410> design<00:02:32.739> and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
are leading the way in tree design and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.570 
are leading the way in tree design and
with<00:02:34.540> using<00:02:35.170> their<00:02:35.349> indigenous<00:02:35.680> trees<00:02:36.220> their

with using their indigenous trees their
natural<00:02:36.790> native<00:02:37.239> trees<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.310> taking<00:02:39.310> those

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
natural native trees and taking those

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.130 
natural native trees and taking those
beyond<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.860> classical<00:02:42.549> design<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.209> doing

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
beyond just classical design and doing

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.559 
beyond just classical design and doing
their<00:02:44.290> own<00:02:44.319> thing<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.010> i<00:02:45.280> think<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.849> is<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
their own thing and i think that is the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.160 
their own thing and i think that is the
strong<00:02:46.989> point<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.590> european<00:02:48.400> trees<00:02:48.670> over

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
strong point of european trees over

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.110 
strong point of european trees over
american<00:02:50.170> trees<00:02:50.470> however<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.220> Americans<00:02:51.790> are

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
american trees however the Americans are

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.339 
american trees however the Americans are
seeing<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.170> value<00:02:53.349> in<00:02:53.829> studying<00:02:54.519> nature<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
seeing the value in studying nature and

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.610 
seeing the value in studying nature and
going<00:02:56.349> their<00:02:56.500> own<00:02:56.620> way<00:02:56.940> which<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.150> hope<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.170> feel

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
going their own way which I hope to feel

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.250 
going their own way which I hope to feel
that's<00:02:59.980> what<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> am<00:03:00.489> doing<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.079> draw<00:03:02.079> energy

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that's what I am doing and draw energy

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.949 
that's what I am doing and draw energy
from<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.920> but<00:03:03.579> like<00:03:03.790> any<00:03:04.000> art<00:03:04.269> form<00:03:04.329> pests

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
from that but like any art form pests

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.220 
from that but like any art form pests
going<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.410> change<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.519> maybe<00:03:06.730> 10<00:03:07.329> 20<00:03:07.810> 50

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
going to change and and maybe 10 20 50

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.190 
going to change and and maybe 10 20 50
hundred<00:03:08.799> years<00:03:09.010> from<00:03:09.129> now<00:03:09.540> both<00:03:10.540> sigh<00:03:10.780> design

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
hundred years from now both sigh design

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.059 
hundred years from now both sigh design
will<00:03:11.470> be<00:03:11.680> completely<00:03:12.220> different<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:14.069> will

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
will be completely different and will

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.520 
will be completely different and will
have<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:16.109> different<00:03:17.910> perspective<00:03:18.910> one<00:03:19.540> on

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
have a different perspective one on

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.030 
have a different perspective one on
trees<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.160> nature<00:03:21.519> so<00:03:22.260> there<00:03:23.260> are<00:03:23.290> people<00:03:23.799> even

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
trees in nature so there are people even

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.190 
trees in nature so there are people even
in<00:03:24.280> Japan<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.700> can<00:03:25.180> take<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.450> tree<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.810> can

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
in Japan that can take a tree you can

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.699 
in Japan that can take a tree you can
design<00:03:26.799> your<00:03:27.040> tree<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.700> they<00:03:28.090> can

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
design your tree and they can

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.729 
design your tree and they can
manufacture<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:30.489> design<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.840> grow<00:03:32.109> tree<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
manufacture that design and grow tree to

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.339 
manufacture that design and grow tree to
look<00:03:32.920> like<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.400> picture<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.510> drawing<00:03:34.959> that

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
look like a picture or a drawing that

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.550 
look like a picture or a drawing that
you<00:03:35.829> do<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.459> already<00:03:36.819> there<00:03:37.810> in<00:03:38.139> Japan

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you do that it's already there in Japan

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.410 
you do that it's already there in Japan
today<00:03:38.910> mostly<00:03:39.910> with<00:03:40.090> deciduous<00:03:40.480> material

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
today mostly with deciduous material

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.530 
today mostly with deciduous material
conifers<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.920> being<00:03:43.220> done<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.849> that

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
conifers but it is being done is that

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.460 
conifers but it is being done is that
art<00:03:44.810> well<00:03:45.170> its<00:03:45.530> mate<00:03:45.980> maybe<00:03:46.459> art<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:48.260> an

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
art well its mate maybe art it's an

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.570 
art well its mate maybe art it's an
extension<00:03:48.830> of<00:03:50.200> design<00:03:51.200> in<00:03:51.230> your<00:03:51.560> mind<00:03:51.830> not<00:03:52.280> of

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
extension of design in your mind not of

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.850 
extension of design in your mind not of
any<00:03:52.910> particular<00:03:53.239> tree<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:53.989> nature<00:03:54.349> or<00:03:54.620> not

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
any particular tree in nature or not

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.580 
any particular tree in nature or not
tree<00:03:55.280> that's<00:03:55.459> sitting<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.270> front<00:03:56.480> it's<00:03:57.380> also

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
tree that's sitting in front it's also

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.300 
tree that's sitting in front it's also
very<00:03:58.180> interesting<00:03:59.180> concept<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.230> is

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
very interesting concept that is

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.220 
very interesting concept that is
happening<00:04:01.310> only<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.300> a<00:04:02.360> few<00:04:02.540> places<00:04:02.690> with<00:04:03.200> a

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
happening only in a few places with a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.229 
happening only in a few places with a
few<00:04:03.530> people<00:04:03.920> in<00:04:04.040> Japan<00:04:04.459> but<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.850> is<00:04:04.970> quite

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
few people in Japan but it is quite

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.080 
few people in Japan but it is quite
interesting<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.530> look<00:04:06.739> at<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.340> so

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
interesting to to look at that and so

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.860 
interesting to to look at that and so
maybe<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.989> our<00:04:09.260> future<00:04:10.120> tree<00:04:11.120> design<00:04:11.450> will<00:04:11.690> be

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
maybe in our future tree design will be

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.620 
maybe in our future tree design will be
coming<00:04:12.140> right<00:04:12.680> from<00:04:12.950> from<00:04:13.489> our<00:04:13.640> lives<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.269> not

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
coming right from from our lives and not

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.479 
coming right from from our lives and not
from<00:04:14.870> even<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.410> tree<00:04:15.620> that's<00:04:15.800> that's<00:04:16.280> and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
from even a tree that's that's and

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.700 
from even a tree that's that's and
drones
