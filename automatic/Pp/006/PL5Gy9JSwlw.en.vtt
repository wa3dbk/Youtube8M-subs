this concept car for example is the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.840 
this concept car for example is the
first<00:02:16.260> car<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> world<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> center

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
first car in the world to have a center

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.850 
first car in the world to have a center

console made of glass crystal at the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
console made of glass crystal at the
very<00:02:20.040> highest<00:02:20.250> quality<00:02:20.850> from<00:02:21.180> our<00:02:21.420> effort

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
very highest quality from our effort

in<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.730> particular<00:02:24.180> car<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.780> think<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
in this particular car I think that the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.470 
in this particular car I think that the
crystal<00:02:25.950> center<00:02:26.280> stack<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.640> an<00:02:26.760> example<00:02:27.269> an

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
crystal center stack is an example an

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870 
crystal center stack is an example an
exponent<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.769> premium<00:02:29.220> could<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.549> in<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
exponent of what premium could be in the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.860 
exponent of what premium could be in the
Scandinavian<00:02:30.150> car

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
Scandinavian car

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.250 
Scandinavian car
I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.620> Scandinavian<00:02:32.130> design<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.450> really

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
I think Scandinavian design is to really

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.340 
I think Scandinavian design is to really
lift<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.040> work<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.390> material<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
lift out and work with the material and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.220 
lift out and work with the material and
form<00:02:37.769> at<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.700> same<00:02:38.880> time<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.360> make<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> as

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
form at the same time and make it as

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.150 
form at the same time and make it as
just<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.650> important<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.620> really

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
just as important that is really

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.130 
just as important that is really
something<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.150> tried<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.780> this

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
something that we have tried for this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.190 
something that we have tried for this
car<00:02:46.970> lifting<00:02:47.970> out<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.780> example<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
car lifting out so for example the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.509 
car lifting out so for example the
center<00:02:49.500> stack<00:02:49.680> where<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> crystal

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
center stack where we have the crystal

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.570 
center stack where we have the crystal
glass<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.989> material<00:02:52.290> speaking<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.430> as

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
glass it's the material speaking just as

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.920 
glass it's the material speaking just as
much<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> form<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:57.090> color<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> concept

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
much as the form the color of a concept

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.229 
much as the form the color of a concept
car<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.170> extraordinary<00:02:58.709> important<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
car is extraordinary important it's a

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.729 
car is extraordinary important it's a
question<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.690> sticking<00:03:01.049> out<00:03:01.200> from<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> crowd

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
question of sticking out from the crowd

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.660 
question of sticking out from the crowd
in<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.310> right<00:03:02.519> way<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.560> s60<00:03:05.100> concept<00:03:05.549> they

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
in the right way so the s60 concept they

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.759 
in the right way so the s60 concept they
chose<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> color<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.630> has<00:03:06.780> been<00:03:06.930> named<00:03:07.200> warm

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
chose a color that has been named warm

liquid copper we want to provoke a

little<00:03:10.829> bit<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.190> side<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.090> also<00:03:12.239> took

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
little bit on one side but we also took

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
little bit on one side but we also took
a<00:03:12.600> color<00:03:12.930> which<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.350> found<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.920> be<00:03:13.950> very

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
a color which we found to be very

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.880 
a color which we found to be very

elements that the brand has really to

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
distinguish it from the competition but

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.460 
distinguish it from the competition but
also<00:04:03.459> promote<00:04:04.269> then<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.959> brand<00:04:05.200> in<00:04:05.380> a
