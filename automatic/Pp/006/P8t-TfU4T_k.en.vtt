budget-friendly device I believe that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.810 
budget-friendly device I believe that
supposed<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.890> 50<00:01:26.400> pounds<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
supposed to be going for 50 pounds and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.230 
supposed to be going for 50 pounds and
under<00:01:28.310> before<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:29.700> taxes<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.460> they're<00:01:32.850> making

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
under before any taxes so they're making

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.789 
under before any taxes so they're making
savings<00:01:33.720> where<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
savings where they can there is the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:58.389 
savings where they can there is the
device<00:01:38.869> inside<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.079> box<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:43.909> charger<00:01:50.509> battery

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.950 

no<00:01:59.399> room<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.640> headphones<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> sync<00:02:01.530> cable

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
no room for headphones or a sync cable

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.770 
no room for headphones or a sync cable
and<00:02:03.960> my<00:02:04.740> guess<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.549> they've<00:02:06.390> done<00:02:06.630> their

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and my guess is that they've done their

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.650 
and my guess is that they've done their
research<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.759> probably<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> lot<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> people<00:02:09.209> do

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
research and probably a lot of people do

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.059 
research and probably a lot of people do
not<00:02:09.690> connect<00:02:10.200> their<00:02:10.349> devices

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
not connect their devices

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.500 
not connect their devices
up<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
up to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.420 
up to
so<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.140> why<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:13.470> done<00:02:13.890> away<00:02:14.099> with<00:02:14.129> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so that's why they done away with the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.350 
so that's why they done away with the
sync<00:02:14.670> cable<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:16.319> they're<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:16.739> trying<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
sync cable and they're really trying to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.460 
sync cable and they're really trying to
cut<00:02:18.360> costs<00:02:18.870> when<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:21.810> stick<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.349> the
