00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:15.879
 It is a problem of passives 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:18.260
 First of Dorsey with feel a look at the choices Tsu length of most of the supposed elongated No. 3 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:23.070
 No. 4 faithful of 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 Nisei has changed, but choose three and all three 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.470
 This is active 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 However, it is the No. 2 not Chozu This only is the passive stand 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.530
 Please look at this issue 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.430
 Point i the boys of warlords 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:49.850
 He was chosen by the boys to be the captain of the team 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:55.710
 It does not mean that he chose someone 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:59.870
 He chose the Cat Once you to die if # 1 and # 3 and # 4 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:06.860
 Then I do not connect i the boys at the end of the sentence 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 This is a passive agent, so if you don't substitute the second one, you won't feel sensibly or semantically 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.180
 That's why 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.180
 Let's confirm by machine whether it is from the original active voice just in case 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.480
 The number of boys in the Lodela position is to the main gun 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.170
 Choose but survey 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.189
 This is my goal 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.189
 2 legs to the song 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.659
 The point of the fifth sentence type is c of the object note protection 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.719
 Semantically = relationship 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.670
 So the boys chose 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:45.010
 Him = captain 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:52.010
 Please be aware that this he and the captain are the same person 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:55.660
 Then, when making 10 conductors from here, the expression that corresponds to the purpose is the subject 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.660
 This day 6 will go back to the day 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.900
 It is chosen the automatic member of the choice next 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.900
 Because the sound is in the past form, Izuhazu is the word hand water 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.240
 The original star changes to be verb + past participle 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.310
 Protected if rest is because there is no relationship at all to the passive voice 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:25.270
 This part is passed down as it is and the second term of the captain 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:31.319
 The last original guardian purchase doubles + 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:34.590
 Because you follow say this last by the boys is not come here 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.959
 For the above, choose from the meaning 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:45.190
 From a farm road stand weak people of the original Kedomo was retired it selected 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:50.410
 It may be understood as a transformation to Judo 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 Then let's confirm the problem statement by sound at the end 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.470
