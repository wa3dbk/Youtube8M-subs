underneath everything the parcel shelf
is<00:01:38.520> still<00:01:38.759> intact<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.659> bits<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.049> wiring

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
is still intact there are bits of wiring

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.350 
is still intact there are bits of wiring
hanging<00:01:40.860> down<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.399> is<00:01:41.520> still<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:41.939> of

so<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> would<00:02:01.020> consider<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
so we now have what I would consider to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.080 
so we now have what I would consider to
be<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.979> 90%<00:02:02.670> car<00:02:03.289> now<00:02:04.289> on<00:02:04.590> top<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.280> finding<00:02:05.939> all

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
be a 90% car now on top of finding all

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.480 
be a 90% car now on top of finding all

you'll<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.830> down<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.670> my<00:02:17.819> box<00:02:18.090> of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
you'll see down here this is my box of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.610 
you'll see down here this is my box of
that<00:02:19.099> I've<00:02:19.220> inventoried<00:02:19.879> now<00:02:20.540> every<00:02:21.319> single

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that I've inventoried now every single

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.880 
that I've inventoried now every single
part<00:02:21.830> goes<00:02:22.370> into<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.640> bag<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.180> then<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:24.620> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
part goes into a bag and then on that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.820 
part goes into a bag and then on that
bag<00:02:25.160> you'll<00:02:25.700> notice<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:27.319> labeled<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.769> with

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
bag you'll notice I have labeled it with

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.460 
bag you'll notice I have labeled it with
the<00:02:28.459> name<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.849> part<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.629> part<00:02:29.870> number<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
the name of part the part number and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.740 
the name of part the part number and
some<00:02:31.280> means<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.700> looking<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.120> part<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.569> in

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
some means of looking the part up in

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.809 
some means of looking the part up in
this<00:02:32.900> case<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.590> figure<00:02:33.819> identification

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
this case it's the figure identification

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.080 
this case it's the figure identification
so<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.300> on<00:02:35.569> Figure<00:02:36.349> n3<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.250> xx<00:02:37.670> item

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
so this is on Figure n3 and it's xx item

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.430 
so this is on Figure n3 and it's xx item
and<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.810> happens<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.080> be<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.319> voltage

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and it just happens to be the voltage

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.039 
and it just happens to be the voltage
regulator<00:02:40.239> now<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.510> go<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:44.780> my

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
regulator now to go with that I have my

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.289 
regulator now to go with that I have my
old-school<00:02:45.590> composition<00:02:46.549> book<00:02:46.790> for<00:02:47.120> this

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
old-school composition book for this

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.400

see I've made a list of all the parts

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.690 
see I've made a list of all the parts
that<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.810> inventoried<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.160> I'll<00:02:58.340> be<00:02:58.489> able<00:02:58.579> to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
that I inventoried so I'll be able to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.610 
that I inventoried so I'll be able to
put<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.510> outside<00:02:59.569> of<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.079> box<00:03:00.319> as

well as into my computer so that at the
point<00:03:03.349> when<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.250> car<00:03:04.459> finally

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
point when I do have this car finally

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.640 
point when I do have this car finally
finished<00:03:05.360> I'll<00:03:05.840> have<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.049> list<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.440> all<00:03:06.560> the

finished I'll have a list of all the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.110 
finished I'll have a list of all the
parts<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.130> can<00:03:07.280> barter<00:03:07.549> away<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.970> other

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
parts that I can barter away for other

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.100 
parts that I can barter away for other
things<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.690> need<00:03:09.160> now<00:03:10.480> not<00:03:11.480> only<00:03:11.660> were<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
things that I need now not only were the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.920 
things that I need now not only were the
parts<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.519> needed<00:03:13.849> inside<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.540> vehicle

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
parts that I needed inside the vehicle

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.259 
parts that I needed inside the vehicle
but<00:03:15.380> as<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.769> turns<00:03:15.980> out<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.940> correct

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
but as it turns out I have the correct

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.750 
but as it turns out I have the correct
transmission<00:03:18.019> tunnel<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.459> piece<00:03:19.730> that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
transmission tunnel so that piece that

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.309 
transmission tunnel so that piece that
was<00:03:20.030> missing<00:03:20.329> from<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> interior<00:03:20.750> car<00:03:21.110> is

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
was missing from the interior car is

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.990 
was missing from the interior car is
here<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.920> just<00:03:22.069> won't<00:03:22.250> fit<00:03:22.549> with<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.849> wrong

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
here it just won't fit with the wrong

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.390 
here it just won't fit with the wrong
transmission<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.590> spare<00:03:24.920> steering

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
transmission I have a spare steering

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.199 
transmission I have a spare steering
wheel<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:26.750> spare<00:03:27.049> dash<00:03:27.350> board<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.579> dash

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
for one of the bumpers and then I've got

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.569 
for one of the bumpers and then I've got
the<00:03:38.600> old<00:03:38.720> buckets<00:03:39.139> for<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:40.010> back<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.220> if<00:03:40.549> you

the old buckets for the back and if you

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.759 
the old buckets for the back and if you
can<00:03:40.850> see<00:03:41.090> them<00:03:41.359> they're<00:03:41.870> pretty<00:03:42.139> well<00:03:42.290> rusted

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
can see them they're pretty well rusted

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.059 
can see them they're pretty well rusted
out<00:03:42.889> so<00:03:43.400> as<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.819> finish<00:03:44.150> up<00:03:44.269> today<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.810> will<00:03:45.139> clean

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
out so as I finish up today I will clean

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.770 
out so as I finish up today I will clean
up<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.400> last<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.819> what<00:03:46.910> I've<00:03:47.030> got<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.450> package

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
up the last of what I've got and package

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.289 
up the last of what I've got and package
everything<00:03:48.049> back<00:03:48.350> up<00:03:48.579> for<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.850> next<00:03:50.090> round

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
everything back up for the next round

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.300 
everything back up for the next round
which<00:03:50.959> will<00:03:51.139> be<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.380> initial<00:03:51.530> disassembly

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
which will be the initial disassembly

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.610 
which will be the initial disassembly
now<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.239> may<00:03:53.359> seem<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.690> little<00:03:53.780> strange<00:03:54.260> the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
now it may seem a little strange the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.190 
now it may seem a little strange the
whole<00:03:54.650> concept<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.720> reassembling<00:03:56.720> your<00:03:56.900> car

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
whole concept of reassembling your car

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.770 
whole concept of reassembling your car
only<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.859> disassemble<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.700> again<00:03:58.940> but<00:03:59.600> what

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
only to disassemble it again but what

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.690 
only to disassemble it again but what
this<00:03:59.870> allows<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.440> do<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:01.130> figure<00:04:01.519> out

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
this allows you to do is figure out

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.589 
this allows you to do is figure out
exactly<00:04:02.000> what<00:04:02.750> parts<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.170> have<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:04.329> then<00:04:05.329> as

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
exactly what parts you have and then as

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.479 
exactly what parts you have and then as
you<00:04:05.750> take<00:04:05.959> them<00:04:06.079> apart<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.650> document<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
you take them apart you document the

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.940 
you take them apart you document the
process<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.090> inventory<00:04:08.480> them<00:04:08.690> correctly<00:04:09.109> so
