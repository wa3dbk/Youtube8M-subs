and<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.070> also<00:01:47.310> used<00:01:47.790> some<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.290> these

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and I also used some of you know these

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
and I also used some of you know these
just<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> section<00:01:50.130> off<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.250> hair<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.240> clip

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
just a section off my hair and this clip

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
just a section off my hair and this clip
to<00:01:51.720> hold<00:01:51.750> some<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> hair<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.590> why<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> do

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to hold some of the hair of why I do

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.399 
to hold some of the hair of why I do
different<00:01:53.579> sections<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.180> yeah<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> think

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
different sections so yeah I think

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.840 
different sections so yeah I think
that's<00:01:55.560> basically<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:56.670> just

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

guys so here is basically my hair in
four<00:02:04.560> sections<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.420> guys<00:02:06.570> say<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
four sections and as you guys say that

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.570 
four sections and as you guys say that
section<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.009> I'm<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.369> start

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
section is out so I'm going to start

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.870 
section is out so I'm going to start
with

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
with

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.030 
with
and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.630> first<00:02:09.900> thing<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.260> is<00:02:10.650> spritz<00:02:10.950> my

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
and the first thing I do is spritz my

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.500 
and the first thing I do is spritz my
hair<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.490> lot<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.880> worry<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.240> want<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
hair with a lot of worry you want to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
hair with a lot of worry you want to
make<00:02:12.630> sure<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.320> know<00:02:13.410> heavily

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
make sure that's you know heavily

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
make sure that's you know heavily
saturated<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> gel<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.330> work<00:02:15.480> better<00:02:15.690> in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
saturated so the gel can work better in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.170 
saturated so the gel can work better in
it<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.490> section<00:02:17.940> by<00:02:18.000> section

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it then I just go section by section

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000 
it then I just go section by section
make<00:02:18.960> sure<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.260> know<00:02:19.380> I'm<00:02:19.470> not<00:02:19.590> breaking<00:02:19.980> my

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
make sure you know I'm not breaking my

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.910 
make sure you know I'm not breaking my
hair<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:21.120> basically<00:02:21.300> detangle<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.710> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
hair and I basically detangle it just so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.280 
hair and I basically detangle it just so
you<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.430> could<00:02:23.550> make<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.000> whole<00:02:24.290> running

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you know it could make the whole running

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
you know it could make the whole running
the<00:02:25.410> Denman<00:02:25.740> brush<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.250> process<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.060> little

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the Denman brush to it process a little

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.870 
the Denman brush to it process a little
bit<00:02:27.420> better<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.920> guys<00:02:29.040> see<00:02:29.370> now<00:02:29.670> I'm

to<00:02:46.050> form<00:02:46.470> at<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.890> point<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.460> that's<00:02:48.330> pretty

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
to form at this point and that's pretty

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
now at this point I'm finished with one

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.940 
now at this point I'm finished with one
side<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:42.960> hair<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.350> guys<00:03:43.560> see<00:03:43.830> I'm

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
side of my hair and you guys see I'm

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.610 
side of my hair and you guys see I'm
shaking<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.550> I'm<00:03:45.360> shaking<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.930> basically<00:03:46.320> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
shaking it I'm shaking it basically so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.200 
shaking it I'm shaking it basically so
that<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.860> can<00:03:47.070> separate<00:03:47.520> some<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.970> curls

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
that I can separate some of the curls

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.150 
that I can separate some of the curls
that<00:03:48.390> maybe<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.870> brush<00:03:49.110> didn't<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:49.980> this

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
that maybe the brush didn't get and this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.250 
that maybe the brush didn't get and this
basically<00:03:50.640> helps<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.300> get<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.720> guess<00:03:51.990> more

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
basically helps you to get I guess more

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.350 
basically helps you to get I guess more
of<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.920> know<00:03:52.950> defined<00:03:53.550> looking<00:03:54.030> your<00:03:54.180> hair

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
of a you know defined looking your hair

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.060 
of a you know defined looking your hair
with<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.570> gel<00:03:54.930> because<00:03:55.260> sometimes<00:03:55.740> like<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.040> said

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
with a gel because sometimes like I said

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.060 
with a gel because sometimes like I said
the<00:03:56.370> brush<00:03:56.550> doesn't<00:03:56.850> get<00:03:57.150> through<00:03:57.360> everything

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
the brush doesn't get through everything

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.160 
the brush doesn't get through everything
but<00:03:59.070> yeah<00:03:59.640> that's<00:03:59.880> pretty<00:04:00.240> much<00:04:00.450> me<00:04:00.690> doing<00:04:01.020> the
