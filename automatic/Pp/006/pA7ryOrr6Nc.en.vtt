basic<00:00:27.750> 60<00:00:28.750> amp<00:00:28.990> ESC<00:00:29.949> I<00:00:29.980> believe<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:31.019> it's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
basic 60 amp ESC I believe and it's

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.700 
basic 60 amp ESC I believe and it's
hooked<00:00:32.259> up<00:00:32.500> to<00:00:32.679> a<00:00:32.710> 36<00:00:33.069> 50<00:00:33.819> kV<00:00:34.089> motor<00:00:34.449> I'm<00:00:35.409> pretty

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
hooked up to a 36 50 kV motor I'm pretty

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.709 
hooked up to a 36 50 kV motor I'm pretty
sure<00:00:35.829> it's<00:00:36.039> just<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.550> hobby<00:00:36.760> wing<00:00:37.030> easy<00:00:37.389> run

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
sure it's just a hobby wing easy run

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.739 
sure it's just a hobby wing easy run
rehashed<00:00:38.379> with<00:00:38.679> the<00:00:38.829> exceed<00:00:39.219> sticker<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:40.629> I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
rehashed with the exceed sticker like I

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.049 
rehashed with the exceed sticker like I
said<00:00:40.989> in<00:00:41.079> my<00:00:41.229> unboxing<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:42.159> a<00:00:42.219> review<00:00:42.519> video<00:00:42.789> I

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
said in my unboxing in a review video I

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.599 
said in my unboxing in a review video I
took<00:00:43.239> out<00:00:43.659> that<00:00:43.719> sticker<00:00:44.139> because<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:45.219> really

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
took out that sticker because it really

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.599 
took out that sticker because it really
hampers<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.359> fans<00:00:46.719> performance<00:00:47.620> fans<00:00:48.339> are

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
hampers the fans performance fans are

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.149 
hampers the fans performance fans are
running<00:00:49.030> really<00:00:49.239> high<00:00:49.679> but<00:00:50.679> then<00:00:50.829> again<00:00:50.920> the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
running really high but then again the

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.859 
running really high but then again the
fan<00:00:51.309> runs<00:00:51.729> really<00:00:52.149> high<00:00:52.389> anyways<00:00:52.839> just

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
fan runs really high anyways just

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:57.209 
fan runs really high anyways just
because<00:00:53.549> the<00:00:54.549> maximum<00:00:55.030> voltage<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.920> 8.4<00:00:56.920> on

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
because the maximum voltage is 8.4 on

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.639 
because the maximum voltage is 8.4 on
which<00:00:57.519> it<00:00:57.699> can<00:00:57.819> run<00:00:58.030> safely<00:00:58.569> and<00:00:58.779> this<00:00:59.319> battery

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
which it can run safely and this battery

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.660 
which it can run safely and this battery
having<00:00:59.859> the<00:00:59.949> v8<00:01:00.219> point<00:01:00.459> 4<00:01:00.670> volts<00:01:01.679> and<00:01:02.679> so<00:01:03.279> now

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
having the v8 point 4 volts and so now

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.940 
having the v8 point 4 volts and so now
let's<00:01:03.879> move<00:01:04.089> on<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.659> actual<00:01:05.379> programming

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
let's move on to the actual programming

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.910 
let's move on to the actual programming
so<00:01:06.280> say<00:01:07.079> this<00:01:08.079> is<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.530> s10<00:01:09.250> PSE<00:01:10.149> which<00:01:10.359> has

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
so say this is the s10 PSE which has

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.080 
so say this is the s10 PSE which has
this<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.979> this<00:01:15.159> whole<00:01:15.399> section<00:01:15.850> right<00:01:15.909> here

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
this like this whole section right here

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.980 
this like this whole section right here
this<00:01:16.600> chart<00:01:17.250> yeah<00:01:18.280> there<00:01:18.939> are<00:01:19.030> base<00:01:19.270> five

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
this chart yeah there are base five

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.569 
this chart yeah there are base five
basic<00:01:21.000> menu<00:01:22.000> items<00:01:22.390> for<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> segment<00:01:23.289> so<00:01:23.579> first

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
basic menu items for a segment so first

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.690 
basic menu items for a segment so first
menu<00:01:25.179> item<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.719> running<00:01:26.530> mode<00:01:26.710> which<00:01:27.039> is<00:01:27.219> for

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
menu item is running mode which is for

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.779 
menu item is running mode which is for
with<00:01:27.909> break<00:01:28.450> or<00:01:28.750> forward<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:29.499> reverse<00:01:30.460> with

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
with break or forward and reverse with

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.149 
with break or forward and reverse with
break<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.570> have<00:01:31.659> your<00:01:31.810> drag<00:01:32.170> brake<00:01:32.380> force<00:01:32.740> you

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
break you have your drag brake force you

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.789 
break you have your drag brake force you
know<00:01:33.249> anywhere<00:01:33.609> from<00:01:33.670> zero<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.179> forty<00:01:34.450> percent

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
know anywhere from zero to forty percent

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.800 
know anywhere from zero to forty percent
you<00:01:35.799> have<00:01:35.890> your<00:01:36.039> low<00:01:36.310> voltage<00:01:36.520> cutoff<00:01:37.149> which

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
you have your low voltage cutoff which

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.130 
you have your low voltage cutoff which
is<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.679> know<00:01:38.770> no<00:01:39.310> cutoff<00:01:39.729> or<00:01:40.060> two<00:01:40.719> point<00:01:40.990> six

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
is you know no cutoff or two point six

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.760 
is you know no cutoff or two point six
volts

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
volts

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.469 
volts
you<00:01:41.890> know<00:01:41.950> all<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> way<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.609> three<00:01:42.939> point<00:01:43.179> 4

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
you know all the way up to three point 4

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.319 
you know all the way up to three point 4
volts<00:01:44.069> per<00:01:45.069> set<00:01:45.369> that's<00:01:45.609> pretty<00:01:45.909> subtle<00:01:46.090> by

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
volts per set that's pretty subtle by

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.580 
volts per set that's pretty subtle by
the<00:01:46.390> way<00:01:46.679> then<00:01:47.679> your<00:01:48.340> fourth<00:01:49.020> section<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.530> is

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the way then your fourth section it is

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.160 
the way then your fourth section it is
start<00:01:51.159> mode<00:01:51.369> or<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.729> puncher<00:01:52.210> how<00:01:52.630> much<00:01:52.810> take

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
start mode or the puncher how much take

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.440 
start mode or the puncher how much take
out<00:01:53.319> for<00:01:53.560> us<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:54.490> know<00:01:54.579> four<00:01:55.090> levels

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
out for us you have you know four levels

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.889 
out for us you have you know four levels
for<00:01:55.659> that<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:56.109> then<00:01:57.100> your<00:01:57.460> fifth<00:01:57.729> menu<00:01:58.509> option

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
for that and then your fifth menu option

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.469 
for that and then your fifth menu option
is<00:01:59.170> maximum<00:02:00.039> braking<00:02:00.369> force<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.299> have

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
is maximum braking force so you have

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.059 
is maximum braking force so you have
anywhere<00:02:01.749> from<00:02:01.929> 25<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.789> 100%<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:05.049> all<00:02:05.740> this

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
anywhere from 25 to 100% now all this

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.529 
anywhere from 25 to 100% now all this
stuff<00:02:06.130> that's<00:02:06.789> in<00:02:07.210> bold

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
stuff that's in bold

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.990 
stuff that's in bold
see<00:02:08.780> they'll<00:02:08.959> focus<00:02:09.349> there<00:02:09.799> we<00:02:09.860> go<00:02:10.250> all<00:02:10.670> that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
see they'll focus there we go all that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.360 
see they'll focus there we go all that
is<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:12.049> default<00:02:12.890> settings<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.370> set

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
is the default settings and so I set

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.910 
is the default settings and so I set
this<00:02:16.519> up<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.969> I<00:02:17.269> make<00:02:18.200> sure<00:02:18.379> that<00:02:18.709> your

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
this up is I make sure that your

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.979 
this up is I make sure that your
receiver<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.420> turned<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.069> and

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
receiver is turned on like that and

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.449 
receiver is turned on like that and
right<00:02:23.989> here<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.319> side<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:25.129> is<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
right here on the side that you see is a

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.580 
right here on the side that you see is a
red<00:02:25.790> set<00:02:26.299> button<00:02:26.569> so<00:02:27.049> what<00:02:27.200> you're<00:02:27.319> gonna<00:02:27.409> do

yet<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.670> your<00:02:32.599> wall<00:02:33.019> you're<00:02:33.620> holding<00:02:33.950> down

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
yet but your wall you're holding down

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.300 
yet but your wall you're holding down
that<00:02:34.129> button<00:02:34.639> you'll<00:02:34.760> turn<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> ESC<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
that button you'll turn on the ESC and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.199 
that button you'll turn on the ESC and
it'll<00:02:37.310> start<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.730> light<00:02:37.879> will<00:02:38.030> start

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
it'll start the light will start

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.699 
it'll start the light will start
flashing<00:02:38.329> but<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.109> make<00:02:39.290> sure<00:02:39.439> you<00:02:39.530> keep

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
flashing but you make sure you keep

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.599 
flashing but you make sure you keep
holding<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:40.159> that<00:02:40.219> button<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:42.739> works<00:02:43.250> in

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
holding down that button and it works in

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.270 
holding down that button and it works in
a<00:02:43.849> manner<00:02:44.389> of<00:02:44.659> flashing<00:02:45.470> light<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.859> basically

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
a manner of flashing light so basically

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.550 
a manner of flashing light so basically
like<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.299> just<00:02:47.510> keep<00:02:47.659> one<00:02:47.870> button<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.409> will

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
like you just keep one button it will

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.490 
like you just keep one button it will
flash<00:02:48.799> like<00:02:49.040> once<00:02:49.400> twice<00:02:49.939> for<00:02:50.750> each<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.379> know

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
flash like once twice for each you know

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.970 
flash like once twice for each you know
section<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:55.280> I'm<00:02:56.030> gonna<00:02:56.379> do<00:02:57.379> an<00:02:57.500> example<00:02:57.829> here

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
section so I'm gonna do an example here

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.809 
section so I'm gonna do an example here
I'm<00:02:58.189> gonna<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.430> set<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.510> drag<00:02:59.810> brake<00:03:00.019> force

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
I'm gonna have set the drag brake force

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.759 
I'm gonna have set the drag brake force
to<00:03:01.819> 10%<00:03:02.720> now<00:03:03.709> that's<00:03:04.209> that's<00:03:05.260> category<00:03:06.260> that's

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
to 10% now that's that's category that's

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.759 
to 10% now that's that's category that's

and<00:03:24.949> beep<00:03:25.099> 1<00:03:26.979> there<00:03:27.979> we<00:03:28.069> go

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
and beep 1 there we go

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.259 
and beep 1 there we go
you<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.949> two<00:03:30.949> flashes<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.669> the<00:03:31.849> motor<00:03:32.030> beeps

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
you have two flashes and the motor beeps

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.030 
you have two flashes and the motor beeps
by<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.569> way<00:03:32.720> just<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:33.229> case<00:03:33.440> if<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.650> can't<00:03:33.949> see

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
by the way just in case if you can't see

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.830 
by the way just in case if you can't see
the<00:03:34.159> light<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.639> during<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.060> setup<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.620> now

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
the light with during the setup so now

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.740 
the light with during the setup so now
I'm<00:03:38.840> gonna

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
I'm gonna

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.220 
I'm gonna
I'm<00:03:41.320> gonna<00:03:41.470> press<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.710> once

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.280 

it's<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.220> was<00:03:47.310> default<00:03:48.300> said<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.959> some

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
it's so it was default said it to some

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.600 
it's so it was default said it to some
at<00:03:49.830> for<00:03:50.519> right<00:03:50.879> now<00:03:50.910> but<00:03:51.690> all<00:03:52.530> cycle<00:03:53.430> back<00:03:53.580> to

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
at for right now but all cycle back to

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:04.240 
at for right now but all cycle back to
to

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.850 

to<00:04:05.250> flash<00:04:05.520> one<00:04:06.060> two<00:04:06.330> three<00:04:06.720> here<00:04:07.050> we<00:04:07.080> go<00:04:07.230> then

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
to flash one two three here we go then

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.949 
to flash one two three here we go then
when<00:04:08.010> you're<00:04:08.130> done<00:04:08.250> setting<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.720> just

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
when you're done setting it you just

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.930 
when you're done setting it you just
switch<00:04:10.260> off<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.650> ESC<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:12.560> turn<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.620> back<00:04:13.740> on

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
switch off the ESC and turn it back on

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.640 
switch off the ESC and turn it back on
and<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.240> mentioned<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.810> fan<00:04:16.200> spins

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
and like I mentioned this fan spins

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.910 
and like I mentioned this fan spins
really<00:04:16.950> high<00:04:17.160> at<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.540> maximum<00:04:19.320> voltage<00:04:19.530> then

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
really high at the maximum voltage then

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.940 
really high at the maximum voltage then
it'll<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.609> point<00:04:21.239> four<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.720> they<00:04:22.680> say

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
it'll have a point four and they say

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.590 
it'll have a point four and they say
they<00:04:23.370> tell<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.730> even<00:04:23.910> though<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.360> run

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
they tell you even though you can run

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.440 
they tell you even though you can run
this<00:04:24.930> setup<00:04:25.440> on<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> three<00:04:26.220> cell<00:04:27.919> they<00:04:29.300> do<00:04:30.300> you

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
this setup on a three cell they do you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.540 
this setup on a three cell they do you
should<00:04:30.600> only<00:04:30.720> run<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.230> two<00:04:31.560> cell<00:04:31.830> at<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
should only run it on a two cell at the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.400 
should only run it on a two cell at the
time<00:04:32.760> being<00:04:32.970> because<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:34.020> much<00:04:34.200> voltage

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
time being because that much voltage

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.250 
time being because that much voltage
would<00:04:34.860> fry<00:04:35.160> out<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.520> little<00:04:35.790> fan<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.600> you

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
would fry out this little fan but you

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.530 
would fry out this little fan but you
probably<00:04:37.620> go<00:04:38.070> around<00:04:38.280> different<00:04:38.940> hobby<00:04:39.270> sites

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
probably go around different hobby sites

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.320 
probably go around different hobby sites
find<00:04:39.900> bigger<00:04:40.200> fans<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:41.010> are<00:04:41.280> made<00:04:41.820> for<00:04:42.030> 12

programming like one thing you just do

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.300 
programming like one thing you just do
is<00:04:56.280> switch<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.510> ESC<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.740> know<00:04:58.800> don't<00:04:59.100> hold

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
is switch on the ESC you know don't hold

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.670
