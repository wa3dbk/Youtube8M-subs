chests<00:00:08.960> using<00:00:09.960> Ches<00:00:10.170> storage<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.340> I've

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
chests using Ches storage so I've

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.700 
chests using Ches storage so I've
created<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.150> file<00:00:12.360> under<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.900> same<00:00:13.110> conditions

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
created a file under the same conditions

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950 
created a file under the same conditions
that<00:00:14.219> you'd<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.549> under<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> 90<00:00:15.389> percent<00:00:15.509> run

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
that you'd be under in a 90 percent run

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.750 
that you'd be under in a 90 percent run
I'm<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.710> sure<00:00:16.859> if<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.160> leaf<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:17.580> this

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I'm not sure if you have leaf at this

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.290 
I'm not sure if you have leaf at this
point<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.210> think<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.449> would<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> sale<00:00:20.300> but

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
point I think that would be the sale but

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.490 
point I think that would be the sale but
it<00:00:21.900> doesn't<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.320> matter<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.350> when<00:00:25.350> you'll

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it doesn't really matter so when you'll

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
it doesn't really matter so when you'll
come<00:00:25.710> over<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.340> chest<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.029> just

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
come over here to this chest you just

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.150 
come over here to this chest you just
get<00:00:27.359> storage<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.529> casually

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
get storage like that really casually

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
get storage like that really casually
and<00:00:29.660> knock<00:00:30.660> down<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> chest<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.380> you

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and knock down the chest like you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.049 
and knock down the chest like you
normally<00:00:31.830> would<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:33.300> run<00:00:33.480> over

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
normally would and then you run over

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.860 
normally would and then you run over
pretty<00:00:36.059> much<00:00:37.190> toward<00:00:38.190> where<00:00:38.480> you<00:00:39.480> would<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.750> if

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pretty much toward where you would go if

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
pretty much toward where you would go if
you<00:00:39.960> were<00:00:40.050> playing<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> game<00:00:40.379> naturally<00:00:41.040> but

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you were playing the game naturally but

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.930 
you were playing the game naturally but
this<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.829> this<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.100> thing<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this little this little thing here is a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
this little this little thing here is a
hindrance<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> leaf

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
hindrance so if you don't have the leaf

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.729 
hindrance so if you don't have the leaf
equipped<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.320> two<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> half

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
equipped that's like two and a half

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.310 
equipped that's like two and a half
seconds<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.460> you're<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> waste

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
seconds that you're gonna have to waste

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
seconds that you're gonna have to waste
you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.739> either<00:00:53.360> jump<00:00:54.360> straight<00:00:54.719> across<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you can either jump straight across and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400 
you can either jump straight across and
then<00:00:55.500> leaf<00:00:56.190> pump<00:00:56.460> once<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
then leaf pump once to get over here and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
then leaf pump once to get over here and
if<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.219> fall<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> worry

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
if you fall you don't have to worry

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.990 
if you fall you don't have to worry
because<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:02.309> climb<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
because you can just climb up this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
because you can just climb up this
little<00:01:03.300> crack<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:06.380> there<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
little crack here and there you go so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.190 
little crack here and there you go so
once<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:10.130> you'll<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.189> behind<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
once you get up you'll be behind a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.830 
once you get up you'll be behind a
regular<00:01:13.200> run<00:01:13.409> by<00:01:13.710> about<00:01:13.920> five<00:01:14.189> seconds

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
regular run by about five seconds

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.859 
regular run by about five seconds
because<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> storage<00:01:16.520> anyway<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.299> once<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
because of storage anyway so once you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
because of storage anyway so once you
get<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.259> loading<00:01:19.590> zone<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
get to this loading zone by the way you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
get to this loading zone by the way you
can't<00:01:20.820> climb<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> wall<00:01:21.330> anywhere<00:01:21.720> else<00:01:21.900> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
can't climb the wall anywhere else just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
can't climb the wall anywhere else just
right<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.100> by<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> loading<00:01:23.549> zone<00:01:23.820> because

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
right here by the loading zone because

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.510 
right here by the loading zone because
of<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.509> textured<00:01:25.070> there's<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.250> white

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
of how it's textured there's this white

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.660 
of how it's textured there's this white
angled<00:01:27.390> texture<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.979> basically<00:01:29.130> start

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
angled texture here you basically start

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
angled texture here you basically start
on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.150> side<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.200> run

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
on the right side of that and then run

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
on the right side of that and then run
toward<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> left<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.100> don't

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
toward the left so right here you don't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.960 
toward the left so right here you don't
want<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> die<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.979> I<00:01:37.979> mean<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> chest

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
want to die and I mean well at a chest

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.399 
want to die and I mean well at a chest
storage<00:01:39.270> glitch<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.720> without<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> chance<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
storage glitch be without the chance of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
storage glitch be without the chance of
dying<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> run<00:01:42.329> toward

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
dying right so you want to run toward

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
dying right so you want to run toward
you<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> well<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> course<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you want to well see right of course and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
you want to well see right of course and
run<00:01:45.810> toward<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.229> black<00:01:46.530> line<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:47.820> once

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
run toward this black line and then once

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
run toward this black line and then once
you're<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> black<00:01:48.630> line<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.470> inch

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you're at the black line you can inch

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
you're at the black line you can inch
your<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.399> without<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> fear<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> dying<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
your way up without a fear of dying I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.179 
your way up without a fear of dying I
might<00:01:52.229> die<00:01:52.409> no<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> way

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
might die no and so because of the way

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
might die no and so because of the way
to<00:01:56.340> angled<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> wall<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> could

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
to angled the wall here so you could

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
to angled the wall here so you could
stand<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.350> over<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> blackboard<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.610> mean<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
stand all over the blackboard I mean the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.179 
stand all over the blackboard I mean the
wooden<00:02:00.840> board<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.350> no<00:02:01.439> longer<00:02:01.649> walk<00:02:01.920> up

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
wooden board you can no longer walk up

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.950 
wooden board you can no longer walk up
but<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.790> wind<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.570> correct<00:02:03.810> direction

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
but the wind is in the correct direction

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.530 
but the wind is in the correct direction
for<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.920> backflip<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.579> leaf<00:02:06.420> pump

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
for you to just backflip and leaf pump

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.530 
for you to just backflip and leaf pump
so<00:02:08.670> since<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.760> still<00:02:09.940> have<00:02:10.030> chest<00:02:10.210> storage

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
so since you still have chest storage

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.900 
so since you still have chest storage
you<00:02:10.690> can't<00:02:10.930> do<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.590> glitch<00:02:11.830> over<00:02:12.460> there<00:02:12.610> where

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you can't do the glitch over there where

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.540 
you can't do the glitch over there where
you<00:02:13.060> jump<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.020> grab<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.230> ledge<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.280> over

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
you jump up and grab the ledge so over

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.040 
you jump up and grab the ledge so over
here<00:02:15.730> you're<00:02:15.910> actually<00:02:16.060> gonna<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.810> waste

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
here you're actually gonna have to waste

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.130 
here you're actually gonna have to waste
a<00:02:17.380> little<00:02:17.740> bit<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.950> time<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.630> stop<00:02:19.630> your<00:02:19.810> swing

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
a little bit of time and stop your swing

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.410 
a little bit of time and stop your swing
and<00:02:20.380> climb<00:02:20.740> up<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.700> takes<00:02:21.940> about<00:02:22.090> three<00:02:22.360> and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and climb up this takes about three and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.690 
and climb up this takes about three and
a<00:02:22.480> half<00:02:22.570> seconds<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:24.190> not<00:02:24.400> something
