00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.730
 and welcome to a new one 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.100
 video of me today I show you mine 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.480
 evening routine for my face I have 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.219
 that already with the morning and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.809
 Tine made the video I can give you 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.360
 every case at the end of the video again 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 in the end card and now probably easy 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.099
 the second part of the facial care 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.269
 routine that I do in the evening and 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.740
 I'll show you all of them now 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.539
 products and I wish you a lot 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.130
 fun in the video but I paint 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 yes me most first time, and it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.400
 not two products that way to mine 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.890
 Also tastes include routine 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.040
 Once that is especially for the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.720
 eyes of mine at enough clean and care 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.980
 the eyes make up remover yours 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.900
 already very very us in my 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.010
 I've seen the videos synonymous 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.020
 always buy again 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.550
 of it is only a very small one 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.200
 bit inside that screams at everyone 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.330
 case after a depleted video that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 you can expect soon but have the 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 I bought again or 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.700
 is already back in backup in your 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.800
 in my beard and I find him easy 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.930
 great I am the waterproof mascara 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.450
 and that's why I keep it daily 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.880
 really everything completely gentle for 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.230
 my eyes of the brend somehow nothing at all 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 and I just do that with cotton pads 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.870
 and then for my own face 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 I'm currently using a cleaning 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.800
 more colorful from the body shop 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 I do not have that yet 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.860
 I've been testing for so long 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 It's really good 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 firm consistency on the skin 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.580
 a little pain I take it that way 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 a fingertip wide and ready that way 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.400
 feels completely on my whole face 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 Actually as if I mean mine 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 cream and then take it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 I do that first with a bit of water 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.090
 just off and then I go 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 then again with so maxi always waiting 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.479
 my entire face and the make-up 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.130
 just so off again and if I 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.540
 then notice that very many 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.170
 Make-up residue on my face 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.700
 are they 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.140
 it is easy to repeat 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.939
 with that over my head over it 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.369
 So I find the two products 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.920
 Anyway, that's great. I can do that here 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.479
 thousandfold recommend and the animal must 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.470
 I just continue to test but so far 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.450
 I like it very much 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.130
 therefore very dry skin supposedly around 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
 then like this product 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.619
 from maria that's the perfect budget 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.789
 higher booster with highly concentrated 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.380
 hyaluronic acid 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.050
 I just always give it that way 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.459
 splatter on my finger and betrayal is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.459
 then so in my face and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.300
 then comes just then the first 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.500
 day care or for the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.510
 night care with me 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.160
 I think that's really great 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.959
 but in between but fear heard 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.220
 anyway, always to my routine I've got 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.600
 me very dry skin and there it is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.010
 just another really nice one 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.319
 Moisturizer once again 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.840
 extra moisture before what you because 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.760
 simply apply in the cream from time to time 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.400
 if I feel like I use then still 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.380
 the facial pink also extra for 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.510
 dry skin that is just an oil 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.239
 then brings me such a pump impulse in 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.739
 Apply on my face and it 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.840
 let me move in shortly before I 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.609
 then I would use my night cream 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.320
 that really only take if you do that 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.690
 he has a feeling that his skin is in the moment 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.370
 just really is very dried out 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.609
 So sometimes you just have it here 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.530
 days or just times when the skin 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.350
 another extra dose somehow 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.489
 Nursing needs that was with me now 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.680
 the last time in any case the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.299
 talents in the weather inversion because it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.730
 sometimes why somehow sometimes have 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.130
 cold there were a few dry spots 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.900
 and that's just rewarding 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.299
 But definitely not everybody would 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.980
 take day so find it is then 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.870
 but a bit too rich but 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.579
 it is actually one for the night 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.350
 very good care and then come 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.660
 as the last step the night cream and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.280
 I use currently also be a 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.950
 eight cream and that is the same 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.220
 series like the face is namely the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.109
 This wild rose row also for extra 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.720
 dry skin with roses 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.150
 sunflower avocado and olive oil 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.890
 and also in the middle acid extra 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.360
 again for moisture I think the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.160
 So far, she has not had it very well yet 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.720
 that's why I can try it 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.040
 not to say that much yet 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.530
 but it is definitely so its 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.150
 my skin is not irritated or me 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.920
 somehow I got pecking 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.110
 but I'm not sure if they are for me 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.370
 Enough is enough what I have before 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.320
 I really wanted to use that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
 because of that I am really 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.510
 Thousand times convinced that is the origin 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.980
 drink on intensive overnight I measured 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.870
 you also shown from time to time 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.310
 I'm empty now because of that 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.780
 I look at the here recently after 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.280
 bought but I wanted you 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.570
 anyway show again and also have 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.239
 she will now be watching this video 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.549
 canceled because I really great 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.350
 but she is relatively expensive 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.160
 costs about 30 euros because of that 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.650
 I will not see you again soon 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.690
 but I'm easy for that 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.160
 Super convinced because she really nice 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.180
 rich is it is actually 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.850
 a mask 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.070
 that means you can do that during the week 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.570
 even use two to three times each 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.730
 After what your skin moisture 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.800
 needs and care and he could yes 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.510
 Apply a little thicker coat and that 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.100
 nice the sun what the act 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.900
 I really have it every day now 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.040
 used as my night cream and me 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.080
 of it really only a thin layer 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.240
 applied it was completely sufficient 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.390
 but it really has my skin 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.950
 Beautifully cared for her beautifully tender 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.870
 and really a lot of moisture 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.560
 donated here is also hyaluronic acid 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.390
 in it 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.740
 the cream rich to apricot I find 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.320
 that's very nice, but that's pretty much 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.700
 intense and strong smell so if 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.800
 you do not like it that much I think 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.810
 I'm pretty intense the the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.669
 Just smell off the cream though 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.560
 still I would you guys on each one 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.150
 case recommend that only once again 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.530
 but as I said I use 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.169
 currently not anymore 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.960
 and for my eyes I use those 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.550
 I also cream in the morning as mine 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.190
 Eyes cream take that is the pro of aging 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.810
 cream by beauty system by douglas and 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.400
 I think that's really great 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.320
 I am rich enough to have them even in the evening 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.950
 it's just that I take it myself 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.690
 from that 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.340
 Apply a little thicker layer because they 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.590
 it also has more time to move in 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.330
 Morgans feather from thin layer on it 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.030
 so that I dedicate concealer and afterwards 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.310
 make up and so on can apply yes 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.320
