00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this one's pretty similar just more of a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
this one's pretty similar just more of a
compact<00:00:36.480> set<00:00:36.680> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> actually<00:00:38.190> called<00:00:38.309> the

compact set this is actually called the
defender<00:00:38.850> casing<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
defender casing and as you see it's a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
defender casing and as you see it's a
pretty<00:00:41.010> high<00:00:41.520> state<00:00:41.969> high<00:00:42.210> stability<00:00:42.480> nice

solid<00:00:44.370> casing<00:00:45.110> actually<00:00:46.110> mixes<00:00:46.469> everything

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
solid casing actually mixes everything

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
solid casing actually mixes everything
pretty<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.190> together<00:00:47.489> there's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> little

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
pretty much together there's a little

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
pretty much together there's a little
patented<00:00:49.379> system<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> idea<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.340> kind

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
patented system of the idea which kind

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.220 
patented system of the idea which kind
of<00:00:51.000> sounds<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> good<00:00:51.390> gimmick<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
of sounds a good gimmick but actually it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.360 
of sounds a good gimmick but actually it
tends<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> work<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:52.980> better<00:00:53.129> than<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
tends to work a lot better than I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
tends to work a lot better than I
expected<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
expected it to what we have here on the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.819 
expected it to what we have here on the
outside<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.250> silicone<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> second

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
outside is silicone and then that second

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
outside is silicone and then that second
layer<00:00:59.010> towards<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> inside<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.079> plastic

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
layer towards the inside is a plastic

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
layer towards the inside is a plastic
casing<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> has<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.489> thin

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
casing and then it has a little thin

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.969 
casing and then it has a little thin
clear<00:01:03.180> coat<00:01:03.449> membrane<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.500> protects<00:01:04.830> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
clear coat membrane that protects your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.109 
clear coat membrane that protects your
ipod<00:01:05.280> screen<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
ipod screen so if you don't have a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.190 
ipod screen so if you don't have a
screen<00:01:06.270> protector<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.080> already

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
screen protector you got one already

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.760 
screen protector you got one already
built<00:01:07.470> into<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> case<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
built into this case and then for you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.960 
built into this case and then for you
everything's<00:01:10.770> pretty<00:01:10.950> easy<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> access<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
everything's pretty easy to access so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
everything's pretty easy to access so
far<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.510> got<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:12.930> pretty<00:01:13.110> nice<00:01:13.320> plugs

uh the only thing that I've had too much
of<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> problem<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.549> actually<00:01:18.210> getting

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

of a problem with is actually getting
the<00:01:18.479> ipod<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.710> casing<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the ipod in and out of the casing so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.620 
the ipod in and out of the casing so
they<00:01:20.939> did<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.479> bit

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
they did make it a little bit

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.120 
they did make it a little bit
complicated<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.470> always<00:01:22.680> means<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
complicated but that always means that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.070 
complicated but that always means that
it's<00:01:23.250> nice<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.549> snug<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.030> inside<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it's nice and snug to get inside so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.240 
it's nice and snug to get inside so
trying<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> open<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.159> casing<00:01:28.189> kind<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
trying to open up this casing kind of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.820 
trying to open up this casing kind of
take<00:01:29.400> everything<00:01:29.909> apart

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.050 

and<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:40.070> know<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.520> taking<00:01:40.850> forever

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
and I know this is taking forever

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.050 
and I know this is taking forever
because<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.870> stink<00:01:42.200> at<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.440> there<00:01:43.160> we<00:01:43.340> go<00:01:43.460> all

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
because I stink at it there we go all

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.000 
because I stink at it there we go all
right<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.930> now<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.080> got<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.440> two<00:01:45.590> parts<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
right so now we got the two parts of the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.460 
right so now we got the two parts of the
casing<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.120> just<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.390> silicone<00:01:48.050> rubber

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
casing this is just a silicone rubber

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.860 
casing this is just a silicone rubber
casing<00:01:49.310> pretty<00:01:49.580> nice<00:01:49.760> actually<00:01:49.790> has<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.570> really

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.320 
to match up with the slots and this kind
of<00:03:03.950> takes<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.310> little<00:03:04.459> bit<00:03:04.640> more<00:03:04.820> time<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.270> I'd

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
of takes a little bit more time and I'd

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.760 
of takes a little bit more time and I'd
like<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> little<00:03:06.140> bit<00:03:06.230> less<00:03:06.410> convenient

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
like it to a little bit less convenient

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.400 
like it to a little bit less convenient
to<00:03:07.010> apply<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.390> as<00:03:08.510> simple<00:03:08.900> as<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.020> once

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410

when<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.590> feels<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:27.800> rubber<00:03:27.920> cone<00:03:28.160> or<00:03:28.340> a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
when it feels like rubber cone or a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.270 
when it feels like rubber cone or a
parent<00:03:29.390> silicone<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.680> gives<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.100> same

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
parent silicone but it gives the same

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.550 
parent silicone but it gives the same
protection<00:03:31.910> as<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.090> plastic<00:03:32.870> casing<00:03:33.410> as<00:03:33.500> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
protection as a plastic casing as you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.170 
protection as a plastic casing as you
guys<00:03:33.680> notice<00:03:33.950> when<00:03:34.070> there's<00:03:34.190> plastic<00:03:34.370> enter

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
guys notice when there's plastic enter

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.120 
guys notice when there's plastic enter
shell<00:03:35.420> skeleton<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.800> gives<00:03:36.920> the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
shell skeleton to it so it gives the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.620 
shell skeleton to it so it gives the
best<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.489> both<00:03:37.640> worlds<00:03:38.030> really<00:03:38.239> gives<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
best of both worlds really gives the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.930 
best of both worlds really gives the
total<00:03:39.080> protection<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> plastic<00:03:40.130> casing<00:03:40.519> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
total protection of a plastic casing the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.400 
total protection of a plastic casing the
protection<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.510> screen<00:03:41.959> cover<00:03:42.170> built

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
protection of the screen cover built

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.020 
protection of the screen cover built
into<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:42.950> then<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.400> also<00:03:43.519> gives<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> nice

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
into it and then it also gives the nice

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.670 
into it and then it also gives the nice
feel<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.570> rubber<00:03:44.780> silicone<00:03:44.990> casing<00:03:45.560> which

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
feel of rubber silicone casing which

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
feel of rubber silicone casing which
also<00:03:45.830> can<00:03:46.070> help<00:03:46.130> or<00:03:46.670> prevent<00:03:47.060> against<00:03:47.510> shock

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
also can help or prevent against shock

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.430 
also can help or prevent against shock
but<00:03:48.650> as<00:03:48.980> us

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
but as us

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.260 
but as us
the<00:03:49.500> sides<00:03:50.100> are<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:50.640> nice<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.940> doesn't<00:03:51.150> add

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
the sides are really nice it doesn't add

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.940 
the sides are really nice it doesn't add
too<00:03:51.480> much<00:03:51.600> thickness<00:03:51.960> to<00:03:52.230> your<00:03:52.350> iPod<00:03:52.590> either<00:03:52.800> i

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
too much thickness to your iPod either i

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.500 
too much thickness to your iPod either i
mean<00:03:53.130> yet<00:03:53.280> does<00:03:53.490> add<00:03:53.640> some<00:03:53.850> bulk<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.330> it's<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
mean yet does add some bulk but it's a

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.150 
mean yet does add some bulk but it's a
lightweight<00:03:54.810> k<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.530> terrible<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
lightweight k so it's not terrible and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.100 
lightweight k so it's not terrible and
then<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:57.150> as<00:03:57.240> us<00:03:57.480> see<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.750> buttons<00:03:58.020> are

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
then but as us see the buttons are

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.740 
then but as us see the buttons are
pretty<00:03:58.320> easy<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.590> access<00:03:59.040> they're<00:03:59.550> not<00:03:59.750> holes

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
pretty easy to access they're not holes

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.850 
pretty easy to access they're not holes
or<00:04:00.990> anything<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.350> but<00:04:01.590> there<00:04:01.740> are

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
or anything like that but there are

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.650 
or anything like that but there are
ridges<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.460> you<00:04:02.640> guys<00:04:02.760> can<00:04:02.880> see<00:04:02.940> right<00:04:03.420> there

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
ridges as you guys can see right there

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.450 
ridges as you guys can see right there
there<00:04:03.810> are<00:04:03.840> ridges<00:04:04.260> for<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:05.160> ridges

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
there are ridges for it and the ridges

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.000 
there are ridges for it and the ridges
are<00:04:05.640> really<00:04:06.240> really<00:04:06.630> really<00:04:07.110> nice<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.710> love

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
are really really really nice I love

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.370 
are really really really nice I love
these<00:04:08.160> ridges<00:04:08.520> these<00:04:09.060> are<00:04:09.320> surprisingly<00:04:10.320> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
these ridges these are surprisingly a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.320 
these ridges these are surprisingly a
lot<00:04:10.410> easier<00:04:10.710> than<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:10.950> thought<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.310> access<00:04:11.760> so

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
lot easier than I thought to access so

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.000 
lot easier than I thought to access so
especially<00:04:12.960> with<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.350> home<00:04:13.500> button<00:04:13.740> there's

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
especially with the home button there's

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.190 
especially with the home button there's
a<00:04:14.040> little<00:04:14.190> indentation<00:04:15.120> where<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.780> square<00:04:16.049> is

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
a little indentation where the square is

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.289 
a little indentation where the square is
so<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.650> feels<00:04:17.010> perfect<00:04:17.459> actually<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.090> this

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
so it feels perfect actually like this

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.280 
so it feels perfect actually like this
feeling<00:04:18.570> almost<00:04:18.690> better<00:04:18.930> than<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.080> did<00:04:19.200> the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
feeling almost better than I did the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.740 
feeling almost better than I did the
actual<00:04:19.410> ipod<00:04:19.860> naked<00:04:20.280> itself<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:21.150> especially

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
actual ipod naked itself so especially

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.600 
actual ipod naked itself so especially
with<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.200> screen<00:04:22.500> cover<00:04:22.710> too<00:04:22.950> if<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.490> don't

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
with the screen cover too if you don't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.040 
with the screen cover too if you don't
have<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.760> screen<00:04:23.940> cover<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.450> want<00:04:24.630> an<00:04:24.690> extra

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
have a screen cover if you want an extra

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.230 
have a screen cover if you want an extra
one<00:04:25.170> like<00:04:25.350> this<00:04:25.500> case<00:04:25.740> includes<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:27.150> one

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
one like this case includes the the one

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.670 
one like this case includes the the one
that's<00:04:27.360> built<00:04:27.540> into<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.810> casing<00:04:28.170> this<00:04:28.560> is

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
that's built into the casing this is

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.840 
that's built into the casing this is
probably<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.980> best<00:04:29.190> one<00:04:29.280> I've<00:04:29.490> seen<00:04:29.640> so<00:04:29.820> far

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
probably the best one I've seen so far

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.670 
probably the best one I've seen so far
in<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.210> casing<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.600> feels<00:04:30.780> fantastic<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.620> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
in a casing it feels fantastic it's a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.620 
in a casing it feels fantastic it's a
great<00:04:31.920> cover<00:04:32.130> for<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.730> I<00:04:33.300> definitely

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
great cover for it and I definitely

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.330 
great cover for it and I definitely
recommend<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.200> if<00:04:34.350> that's<00:04:34.440> one<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.830> pros

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
recommend that if that's one of the pros

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.920 
recommend that if that's one of the pros
do<00:04:35.490> you're<00:04:35.520> looking<00:04:35.790> for<00:04:35.940> encasing<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
do you're looking for encasing and the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.970 
do you're looking for encasing and the
other<00:04:37.080> thing<00:04:37.230> that<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.410> thought<00:04:37.530> was<00:04:37.680> also

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
other thing that I thought was also

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.250 
other thing that I thought was also
really<00:04:38.220> cool<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.730> towards<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.450> bottom<00:04:39.600> your

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
really cool is towards the bottom your

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.290 
really cool is towards the bottom your
slots<00:04:40.770> aren't<00:04:41.040> accessible<00:04:41.280> until<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:42.060> pull

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
slots aren't accessible until you pull

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.810 
slots aren't accessible until you pull
back<00:04:42.510> these<00:04:42.780> little<00:04:43.080> rubber<00:04:43.710> tabs<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.670> are

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
back these little rubber tabs that are

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.870 
back these little rubber tabs that are
attached<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.080> casing<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:47.040> now<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.760> can

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
attached to the casing so now we can

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.180 
attached to the casing so now we can
access<00:04:48.300> our<00:04:48.480> head<00:04:49.140> foot<00:04:49.410> headphone<00:04:49.740> jack<00:04:49.950> over

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
access our head foot headphone jack over

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.950 
access our head foot headphone jack over
here<00:04:50.340> in<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.490> 30<00:04:50.700> pin<00:04:50.880> connector<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.480> then

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
here in the 30 pin connector and then

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.390 
here in the 30 pin connector and then
just<00:04:52.110> as<00:04:52.260> simple<00:04:52.410> as<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.950> can<00:04:53.070> just<00:04:53.220> snap

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400
