could<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.579> get<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.840> rear<00:02:59.019> i/o<00:02:59.200> shield<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.769> fit

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
could not get the rear i/o shield to fit

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
could not get the rear i/o shield to fit
I<00:03:00.129> don't<00:03:00.310> know<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:00.519> they<00:03:00.609> sent<00:03:00.819> me<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.970> wrong

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
I don't know if they sent me the wrong

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.780 
I don't know if they sent me the wrong
one<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.299> don't<00:03:01.660> think<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.019> i<00:03:02.260> think<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:03.340> user

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
one I don't think so i think if user

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.860 
one I don't think so i think if user
error<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:04.870> i<00:03:06.150> got<00:03:07.150> fed<00:03:07.359> up<00:03:07.390> with<00:03:07.629> trying<00:03:07.840> to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
error but i got fed up with trying to

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.039 
error but i got fed up with trying to
put<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.109> on<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.470> i<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.769> left<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.879> off<00:03:10.060> i'll

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
put it on so i just left it off i'll

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.289 
put it on so i just left it off i'll
probably<00:03:11.290> put<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.799> later<00:03:12.069> when<00:03:12.549> i<00:03:12.579> take<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
probably put it on later when i take the

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.509 
probably put it on later when i take the
motherboard<00:03:13.690> out<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:16.980> redo<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.220> cable

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
motherboard out and redo the cable

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.720 
motherboard out and redo the cable
management<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.090> stuff<00:03:19.299> like<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:20.730> kill

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
management and stuff like that kill

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.610 
management and stuff like that kill
management<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.359> this<00:03:22.599> case<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.959> amazing<00:03:23.470> it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
management in this case is amazing it

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.259 
management in this case is amazing it
there's<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.069> many<00:03:24.159> holes<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.700> places<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.090> hide

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
there's so many holes and places to hide

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.110 
there's so many holes and places to hide
cables<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.950> now<00:03:27.129> it<00:03:27.280> looks<00:03:27.310> kind<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.819> messy

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
cables right now it looks kind of messy

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.099 
cables right now it looks kind of messy
but<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:30.209> better<00:03:31.209> than<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.569> lot<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:31.989> things

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
but it's better than a lot of things

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.759 
but it's better than a lot of things
that<00:03:32.260> I've<00:03:32.410> seen<00:03:33.870> I'll<00:03:34.870> definitely<00:03:35.169> have<00:03:35.590> to

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that I've seen I'll definitely have to

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.540 
that I've seen I'll definitely have to
redo<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.099> though

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.650

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
you know the ati radeon 5850 the fan is

you know the ati radeon 5850 the fan is
extremely<00:04:29.300> loud<00:04:29.480> which<00:04:30.470> i'll<00:04:30.650> show<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.920> right

ok

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.820 

but<00:04:56.800> I<00:04:56.830> know<00:04:57.570> fans<00:04:58.570> be<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.960> 21-percent<00:04:59.500> and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
but I know fans be is a 21-percent and

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.800 
but I know fans be is a 21-percent and
you<00:04:59.890> can't<00:05:00.100> really<00:05:00.280> hear<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.580> at<00:05:00.730> all<00:05:00.850> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
you can't really hear it at all the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.510 
you can't really hear it at all the
temperature<00:05:02.170> is<00:05:02.260> at<00:05:02.380> 39<00:05:02.770> degrees<00:05:02.800> d<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.250> was

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
temperature is at 39 degrees d I was

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.300 
temperature is at 39 degrees d I was
just<00:05:03.640> playing<00:05:03.880> world<00:05:04.030> warcraft<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:05.310> it's

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
just playing world warcraft so it's

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.940 
just playing world warcraft so it's
probably<00:05:06.460> higher<00:05:06.910> than<00:05:07.150> idle<00:05:07.960> idols<00:05:08.530> usually

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
probably higher than idle idols usually

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.320 
probably higher than idle idols usually
around<00:05:09.130> 30<00:05:09.940> degrees<00:05:10.570> Celsius<00:05:11.970> that<00:05:12.970> stock

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
around 30 degrees Celsius that stock

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:23.860 
around 30 degrees Celsius that stock
locks<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:15.930> auto<00:05:16.930> fans<00:05:17.260> beaded<00:05:17.560> on<00:05:19.290> all<00:05:20.290> right

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.770 

as<00:05:24.470> I<00:05:24.620> said<00:05:24.680> it<00:05:24.980> was<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.510> 21%<00:05:26.510> fan<00:05:26.690> speed<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
as I said it was that 21% fan speed the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.260 
as I said it was that 21% fan speed the
camera<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.110> about<00:05:30.410> a<00:05:30.820> foot<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:31.850> a<00:05:31.940> half<00:05:31.970> away

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
camera is about a foot and a half away

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.470 
camera is about a foot and a half away
from<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:33.580> docs<00:05:34.580> card<00:05:34.880> itself<00:05:35.350> so<00:05:37.240> I'll<00:05:38.240> bring

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
from the docs card itself so I'll bring

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:48.320 
from the docs card itself so I'll bring
up<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.750> fan<00:05:38.930> speed<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:40.300> forty<00:05:41.300> percent

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.570 

alright<00:05:48.990> let's<00:05:49.259> get<00:05:49.379> loud<00:05:49.530> already<00:05:49.889> only

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
alright let's get loud already only

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.570 
alright let's get loud already only
eight<00:05:50.699> forty-one<00:05:50.939> percent<00:05:51.379> here<00:05:52.379> we<00:05:52.439> go<00:05:52.580> fifty

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
eight forty-one percent here we go fifty
