00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
maybe the TV is combined with the screen

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.320 
maybe the TV is combined with the screen
or<00:00:22.890> maybe<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> TV<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.609> running<00:00:23.910> separately

and you're controlling it or maybe

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.050 
and you're controlling it or maybe
you're<00:00:26.130> playing<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> game<00:00:26.460> separately<00:00:27.029> on

the TV and all those different

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
the TV and all those different
combinations<00:00:29.279> what's<00:00:30.000> exciting<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
combinations what's exciting is that

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.040 
combinations what's exciting is that
OnLive<00:00:31.640> was<00:00:32.640> designed<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.420> exactly<00:00:33.840> that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
OnLive was designed to do exactly that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.500 
OnLive was designed to do exactly that
sort<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> thing<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.000> part<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.420> parcel

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
sort of thing but it's part and parcel

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
sort of thing but it's part and parcel
to<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> way<00:00:37.079> online<00:00:37.320> works<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:38.040> some<00:00:38.250> special

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to the way online works not some special

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.639 
to the way online works not some special
mode<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.660> falls<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> fact<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
mode it just falls out of the fact that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
mode it just falls out of the fact that
with<00:00:40.890> cloud<00:00:41.250> gaming<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.570> play<00:00:42.750> games

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
with cloud gaming you can play games

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
with cloud gaming you can play games
anywhere<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.770> want<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.370> any<00:00:44.760> device<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> you

never been done in a game before and
that<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.740> they've<00:01:38.340> made<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> high-performance

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that is they've made a high-performance

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.090 
that is they've made a high-performance
game<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:40.110> couldn't<00:01:40.350> possibly<00:01:40.380> run<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
tablet be touch aware and the reason

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.620 
tablet be touch aware and the reason
they<00:01:44.399> did<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.360> about

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
they did that is because they know about

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
they did that is because they know about
cloud<00:01:45.930> gaming<00:01:46.229> cloud<00:01:47.100> gaming<00:01:47.369> makes<00:01:47.700> it
