00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
original movies about here's a little

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.500 
original movies about here's a little
feature<00:03:58.769> at<00:03:59.100> where<00:03:59.310> we<00:03:59.459> basically<00:04:00.120> walk<00:04:00.329> you

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
feature at where we basically walk you

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.319

through<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.810> movie<00:04:01.130> okay<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:03.180> there's

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
through the movie okay and then there's

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.120 
through the movie okay and then there's
one<00:04:03.540> called<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.959> legacy<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.680> jungle<00:04:05.010> book

one called the legacy of the jungle book

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and this would be equivalent to your

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.990 
and this would be equivalent to your
traditional<00:04:06.690> making<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.620> video<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.850> was
