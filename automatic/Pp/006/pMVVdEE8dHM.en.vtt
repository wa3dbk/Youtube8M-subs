amuse work on those four shots at least
for<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> month<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:59.330> when<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.720> realize<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.460> 15

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
for a month and when you realize that 15

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.020 
for a month and when you realize that 15
or<00:03:01.790> 10<00:03:02.510> fire<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.530> getting<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:04.220> for<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
or 10 fire is getting is for you and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.900 
or 10 fire is getting is for you and
then<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.960> increase<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.620> numbers<00:03:07.070> start

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
then you increase the numbers start

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.450 
then you increase the numbers start
doing<00:03:08.240> 15<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.380> 20<00:03:10.010> 30<00:03:10.630> 50<00:03:12.280> because<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
doing 15 you do 20 30 50 because the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.200 
doing 15 you do 20 30 50 because the
stronger<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.270> get<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.350> easier<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.880> learn<00:03:17.150> and

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
stronger you get the easier to learn and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:25.390 
stronger you get the easier to learn and
Chuck<00:03:18.170> moves<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.250> movements<00:03:20.060> will<00:03:20.660> be<00:03:24.400> once

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
Chuck moves and movements will be once

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.000 
Chuck moves and movements will be once
you<00:03:25.550> have<00:03:25.760> nailed<00:03:26.120> those<00:03:26.870> normal<00:03:27.380> push-ups

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
you have nailed those normal push-ups

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.300 
you have nailed those normal push-ups
you<00:03:28.550> should<00:03:28.850> try<00:03:29.140> specific<00:03:30.140> ups<00:03:30.560> specific
