this woodsy for those tracks that we

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.090 
this woodsy for those tracks that we
were<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.660> across<00:04:09.350> there<00:04:09.650> because<00:04:09.980> that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
were that across there because that

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.040 
were that across there because that
could<00:04:10.340> be<00:04:10.490> if<00:04:10.580> he<00:04:10.610> went<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.060> way

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
could be if he went that way

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.600 
could be if he went that way
then<00:04:12.440> there's<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.710> good<00:04:12.860> chance<00:04:13.070> that<00:04:13.250> that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
then there's a good chance that that

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.490 
then there's a good chance that that
could<00:04:14.030> be<00:04:14.060> your<00:04:14.270> area<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.660> prints<00:04:14.900> were<00:04:15.050> in<00:04:15.260> or
