that's<00:02:41.909> annoying<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.629> me<00:02:42.659> that's<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.140> fun<00:02:43.379> at

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
that's annoying to me that's not fun at

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.009 
that's annoying to me that's not fun at
all<00:02:43.620> that's<00:02:43.890> that's<00:02:44.239> I'm<00:02:45.239> not<00:02:45.269> really<00:02:45.750> into

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
all that's that's I'm not really into

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.589 
all that's that's I'm not really into
that<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.849> feel<00:02:47.849> like<00:02:48.030> people<00:02:48.209> are<00:02:48.480> getting

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
that I feel like people are getting

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.680 
that I feel like people are getting
these<00:02:48.900> easy<00:02:49.290> kills<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.010> they<00:02:50.190> don't<00:02:50.430> deserve

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
these easy kills that they don't deserve

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.970 
these easy kills that they don't deserve
because<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> map<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.349> small<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.709> they

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
because the map is so small that they

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.259 
because the map is so small that they
can<00:02:53.159> do<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.879> course<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
can do that and then of course it

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.339 
can do that and then of course it
promotes<00:02:54.629> things<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.109> shotguns<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:58.260> know

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
promotes things like shotguns and I know

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.349 
promotes things like shotguns and I know
the<00:02:58.680> shotguns<00:02:59.129> are<00:02:59.310> annoying<00:02:59.579> especially<00:02:59.760> in

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
the shotguns are annoying especially in

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.270 
the shotguns are annoying especially in
this<00:03:00.720> game<00:03:01.079> because<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.560> seems<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:01.950> even<00:03:02.099> if

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
this game because it seems like even if

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.410 
this game because it seems like even if
you're<00:03:02.400> hitting<00:03:02.609> somebody<00:03:02.849> with<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> shotgun

you're hitting somebody with a shotgun

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.149 
you're hitting somebody with a shotgun
it<00:03:03.810> doesn't<00:03:04.139> matter<00:03:04.349> because<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.889> they<00:03:05.040> got

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
it doesn't matter because all they got

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.629 
it doesn't matter because all they got
to<00:03:05.190> do<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.700> raise<00:03:06.299> up<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.750> bam<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.500> you've<00:03:08.430> got

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.210 
small maps because the probability of
something<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.579> happening<00:03:39.079> just

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
something like that happening just

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.610 
something like that happening just
increases<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.669> map<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.480> small<00:03:42.900> so

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
increases because the map is so small so

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.800 
increases because the map is so small so
this<00:03:43.829> map<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.430> hijack<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.239> hate<00:03:45.449> them<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:45.660> hate

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
ops 1 if you got the gunship on this map

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.960 
ops 1 if you got the gunship on this map
actually<00:04:16.560> forget<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.130> gunship<00:04:17.459> even<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:17.849> you

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.039 
got the chopper gunner on this map it
was<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.909> much<00:04:21.180> fun<00:04:21.419> if<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.750> got<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
was just so much fun if you got the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.719 
was just so much fun if you got the
Rolling<00:04:22.469> Thunder<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:23.099> took<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> whole

so<00:04:25.410> that's<00:04:25.590> really<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.889> only<00:04:26.430> positive<00:04:26.699> about

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
so that's really the only positive about

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.370 
so that's really the only positive about
the<00:04:28.530> small<00:04:28.860> maps<00:04:29.100> at<00:04:29.340> least<00:04:29.639> for<00:04:29.880> me<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:31.080> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the small maps at least for me but you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.140 
the small maps at least for me but you
know<00:04:31.500> what<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.710> wish<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.220> could<00:04:32.400> get<00:04:32.639> with

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
know what I wish we could get with

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.620 
know what I wish we could get with
next-gen<00:04:33.810> gaming<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:34.940> wish<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.120> games<00:04:36.389> like
