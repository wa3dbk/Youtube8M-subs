00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
too advanced warfare today now as you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
too advanced warfare today now as you
guys<00:00:37.170> probably<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.559> four<00:00:37.890> new<00:00:38.010> cameras<00:00:38.399> came

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
guys probably know four new cameras came

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.610 
guys probably know four new cameras came
I<00:00:38.850> believe<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.480> tiki<00:00:39.930> backdraft

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I believe it's like tiki backdraft

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
I believe it's like tiki backdraft
lagoon<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.519> psychedelic<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
lagoon and psychedelic and so this is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
lagoon and psychedelic and so this is
probably<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> second<00:00:44.010> best<00:00:44.220> or<00:00:44.460> maybe<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
probably the second best or maybe the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.280 
probably the second best or maybe the
third<00:00:44.940> best<00:00:45.180> camel<00:00:45.540> in<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.720> opinion<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.260> think

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
third best camel in my opinion I think

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.040 
third best camel in my opinion I think
it<00:00:46.589> goes<00:00:46.680> psychedelic<00:00:47.399> backdraft<00:00:48.030> lagoon<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it goes psychedelic backdraft lagoon and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
it goes psychedelic backdraft lagoon and
then<00:00:49.559> tiki<00:00:50.159> so<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.699> cameras<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.030> pretty<00:00:51.180> cool

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
then tiki so the cameras are pretty cool

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
then tiki so the cameras are pretty cool
there<00:00:51.690> okay<00:00:52.019> psychedelic<00:00:52.979> is<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.220> awesome

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
there okay psychedelic is like awesome

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.040

backdraft<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.479> cool<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.899> two

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
backdraft is pretty cool the other two

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.509

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
so you can't really see it too well and
it's<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.100> animated<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.000> camo<00:01:57.299> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's not that animated but this camo is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.000 
it's not that animated but this camo is
actually<00:01:57.930> animated<00:01:58.470> if<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.650> look<00:01:58.799> at<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
actually animated if you look at it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.070 
actually animated if you look at it
really<00:01:59.250> closely<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.750> towards

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
really closely and actually have towards

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.210 
really closely and actually have towards
the<00:02:01.140> end<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.409> game<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> scene<00:02:02.190> where

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
the end of this game was a scene where

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.520 
the end of this game was a scene where
he's<00:02:02.580> he<00:02:03.240> got<00:02:03.360> shot<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.869> lot<00:02:04.049> he's<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.440> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
he's he got shot up a lot he's in the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
he's he got shot up a lot he's in the
back<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> corner<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> dark

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
back of a corner and it's kind of dark

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.389 
back of a corner and it's kind of dark
so<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.690> darker<00:02:07.140> areas<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> lot

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so in darker areas you can see it a lot

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.520 
so in darker areas you can see it a lot
better<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.229> lot<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
better but there's actually a lot of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.679 
better but there's actually a lot of
water<00:02:10.979> there's<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.370> water<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.909> this<00:02:12.269> camo

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
water there's like water on this camo

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.050 
water there's like water on this camo
and<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.830> kinda<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.099> streams<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and it's kinda like streams and the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.089 
and it's kinda like streams and the
streams<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.750> moving<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.379> green<00:02:16.650> part<00:02:16.920> I

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
streams are moving but the green part I

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.470 
streams are moving but the green part I
don't<00:02:17.250> think<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.519> really<00:02:17.610> moves<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.269> there's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
don't think it really moves but there's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.320 
don't think it really moves but there's
the<00:02:18.750> blue<00:02:19.049> water<00:02:19.409> stream<00:02:19.920> between<00:02:20.370> all<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the blue water stream between all the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.809 
the blue water stream between all the
like<00:02:22.019> leafy<00:02:22.530> creamy<00:02:23.069> kind<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.489> look<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
like leafy creamy kind of look is

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.759 
like leafy creamy kind of look is
actually<00:02:24.330> moving<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.870> looks<00:02:25.019> really<00:02:25.470> cool

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
actually moving so it looks really cool

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.559 
actually moving so it looks really cool
when<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.189> moves<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:27.120> actually<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> really

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
when it moves and it's actually a really

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.390 
when it moves and it's actually a really
neat<00:02:27.840> camel<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.349> lot<00:02:28.530> cooler<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.370> I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
neat camel it's a lot cooler but they I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.640 
neat camel it's a lot cooler but they I
don't<00:02:29.519> think<00:02:29.790> they<00:02:29.879> did<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> very<00:02:30.750> good<00:02:31.110> job<00:02:31.260> on

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
like the contrast between them

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.090 
like the contrast between them
the<00:02:33.750> cream<00:02:34.050> because<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.590> can't<00:02:34.800> see<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.070> very

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
