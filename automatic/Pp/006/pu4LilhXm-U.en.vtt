00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.440
 channel today i would like to talk about 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.359
 such a phenomenon as a typical Englishman 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.689
 my friends often ask me what 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.330
 what are these typical english what is it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.710
 special and unusual they have and 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.430
 first of all I want to say that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.620
 a typical Englishman is not easy to find 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.739
 especially in big cities since very 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.420
 a lot of people who emigrated that is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.270
 in fact they are not English and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.340
 find exactly that person who 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.280
 spent a long time here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 or born hard enough here 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.199
 I want to emphasize and that people are very 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.160
 different as in any other country there is 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.729
 people that you like more there 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.650
 people who are shocking you and 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.869
 say that all english is good 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.010
 or they are all bad can not be 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.030
 generalize who you were in another case 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.710
 would be incorrect 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 but I would just like to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 talk and share some of your own 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 impressions that for me is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.890
 typical englishman i mean what 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 traits or maybe even 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.200
 appearance because in the comments i 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.820
 noticed a lot of people ask how 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.390
 the British look and watch whether they 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.720
 there for the health of their teeth or how 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.450
 they dress and then and so what 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.180
 English by nature by mine 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.619
 many sound observations are very 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.560
 friendly and very open and so 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.140
 the stereotype that they are closed and 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.720
 cold probably not quite right 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:07.280
 Of course there are people more good-natured and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.970
 completely open but also can 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.270
 easy 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.680
 invite you to your home and that is 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.570
 They do not have an attitude that this is my house 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.920
 my castle which is closed to all 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.730
 not at all the English go to a friend in 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.480
 the guests 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.730
 communicates sometimes the usual conversation in 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.580
 some store can outgrow just 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.080
 in the story and your life about your family 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.390
 but at the same time it should be understood that 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.640
 under this can be good-naturedly sti then 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.220
 there is no need to expect anything straight to everyone 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.410
 more or some long 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.690
 relationship immediately this here is just that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.090
 such resins in general, but in character 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.400
 the English are very social 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.500
 it is instilled since childhood because 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.570
 schoolchildren often visit various 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.450
 mugs like here is very big 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.209
 attention is paid to sport and usually everything 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.120
 kids play some sports and 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.590
 and not limited to some here 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.640
 as classic as football 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.250
 basketball 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.190
 and very often it is a big variety 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.840
 games and including girls and kamikaze a 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.690
 Here is such a special command 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.510
 these all sports 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.180
 causes children to be very good 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.080
 adapt precisely stay in society 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.420
 they are more sociable and open about 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.880
 looks the British are really watching 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.600
 you can't say that they are 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.900
 sluts but can our Slavic standards 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.670
 we it will not be quite here like that 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.450
 what are we talking about when people on 1 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.530
 dress neatly more relaxed 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.290
 more democratic in their clothes 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.110
 typical english and probably can't 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.510
 doesn't pay that much attention to it 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.980
 how much do we pay because probably 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.980
 clothes for us is some kind of expression 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.700
 wealth status here somehow to this 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.270
 easier to relate a lot of things at the same time 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.420
 we can not say that somehow absolutely 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.440
 ugly 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.430
 stylish or do not know and can probably 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.710
 the girl wants to say that when you go 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:32.510
 somewhere was hit a night club the well, there are 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.330
 already too girls go too far 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.610
 that plan that not only dresses 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.630
 not at all according to the weather, that is, if it is convenient 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.940
 in the winter do not take a jacket in a nightclub 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.970
 that girl does that because 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.770
 don't hand over her wardrobe and forget her 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.140
 there by chance that is a girl just 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.160
 puts on a dress and goes in the snow like this 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.680
 here and without pantyhose and so on that is it 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.180
 a little bit such a shocking moment this 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:06.790
 while the girls are very fond of overhead 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.110
 eyelashes nails in various bright colors and 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.000
 maybe it would be nice if 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.040
 something was separate but if 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.460
 the girl had worn clothes this time 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.560
 everything 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:23.180
 and it goes very well to say rich 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:27.169
 and overly typical Englishman is very 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.980
 loves going to the pub and pubs for the english 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:35.930
 it's not a bar or a place to drink a 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.440
 more like a place to chat and spend 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.820
 time with your friends and acquaintances 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.570
 neighbors because it is very popular for 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.130
 both on how is your local pub local there 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.750
 where the whale matches are constantly included 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.870
 are held 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.430
 at the door of the karaoke another such moment 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.740
 which may of course seem 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.770
 trivial but nevertheless typical 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.340
 the British don't take off their shoes in the house or in 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.750
 flat 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.970
 that is, while probably in our 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.430
 culture more always take off 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.040
 shoes or at least ask about 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.000
 this in england you may encounter 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.050
 so that they will come to visit you and just 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.150
 go straight to the gym in shoes and can 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.190
 only if on the street so already some 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.830
 bad weather and dirty can ask but 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.230
 even I was faced with the fact that it is not 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:35.390
 stops people that is made up 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:38.390
 with a lot of dirt and probably when even 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.880
 you ask sorry you can ask 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.980
 take off your shoes on you might think that you 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.590
 snapper necessarily lifestyle then to 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.680
 I received questions like the British 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.010
 watch your weight and here i can 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.850
 to tell that 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.310
 typical english for me 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.800
 really trying to lead healthy 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.470
 Lifestyle 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.860
 watch your diet so that it is 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.680
 enough physical exertion 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.180
 often it is the gym that leaves 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.710
 systematically and so me on 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:16.820
 the streets notice that people are overweight 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.290
 not so much weighing 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.990
 quantity when 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.880
 if you compare for example the United States has spoken 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.010
 many very rapidly Well here are my 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.010
 impressions of the greenhouse the British do not 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.840
 ask your questions under the video can i 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.290
 fulfill all what's a while before the new 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.290
 meeting
