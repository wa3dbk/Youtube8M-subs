so<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.669> Dragons<00:03:23.060> went<00:03:23.269> back<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.689> the<00:03:23.780> medieval

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
so the Dragons went back to the medieval

pace<00:03:24.590> learning<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.489> slow<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.970> steady<00:03:26.239> is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
pace learning that slow and steady is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.780 
pace learning that slow and steady is
what<00:03:26.810> wins<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.230> race<00:03:27.409> and<00:03:27.680> rushing<00:03:28.579> things

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
what wins the race and rushing things

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.849 
what wins the race and rushing things
much<00:03:29.030> too<00:03:29.239> soon<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:29.989> trying<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.409> shoot<00:03:30.620> for

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
much too soon like trying this shoot for

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.280
