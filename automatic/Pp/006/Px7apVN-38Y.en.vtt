00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
since last one did was like in July or

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310 
since last one did was like in July or
something<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> long

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
something like that so that was a long

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.179 
something like that so that was a long
time<00:00:28.590> ago<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.090> enjoy<00:00:30.480> these<00:00:31.080> videos

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
time ago and I really enjoy these videos

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
time ago and I really enjoy these videos
so<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.520> figured<00:00:32.940> I'd<00:00:33.090> make<00:00:33.239> another<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.780> since

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.540 
so I figured I'd make another one since
I<00:00:34.399> don't<00:00:35.399> carry<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> same<00:00:36.000> stuff<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:36.540> purse
