Gundam<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.540> first<00:00:36.809> impression<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Gundam so my first impression of this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.880 
Gundam so my first impression of this
overall<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.840> colorful<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.649> think

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
overall is just colorful and I think

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.690 
overall is just colorful and I think
that<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> biggest

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that that's one of the biggest

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
that that's one of the biggest
complaints<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.420> had<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> seed

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
complaints that I had about the seed

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.670 
complaints that I had about the seed
high-grade<00:00:44.300> models<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
high-grade models is that because you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
high-grade models is that because you
had<00:00:46.860> kits<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.250> infinite<00:00:47.670> justice<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
had kits like infinite justice and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
had kits like infinite justice and
strike<00:00:48.510> freedom<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> whole<00:00:49.770> bunch<00:00:49.980> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
very small colored parts all over their

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
very small colored parts all over their
bodies<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.329> happened<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> when

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
bodies that what happened was is when

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.450 
bodies that what happened was is when
they<00:00:55.260> made<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> high<00:00:55.680> grades<00:00:56.010> those<00:00:56.280> were

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
they made the high grades those were

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
they made the high grades those were
either<00:00:56.579> done<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.090> seals<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.899> ignored

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
either done with seals or just ignored

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720 
either done with seals or just ignored
but<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> thing<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.219> I've<00:00:59.399> been<00:00:59.430> most

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
but the thing that I've been most

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.099 
but the thing that I've been most
impressed<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.570> building<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.960> high

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
impressed with in building the high

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
impressed with in building the high
grade<00:01:01.350> X<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.070> high<00:01:02.280> grade<00:01:02.579> god<00:01:02.820> Gundam

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
grade X and this high grade god Gundam

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
grade X and this high grade god Gundam
now<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> fact<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> don't

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
now is just in the fact that I don't

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
now is just in the fact that I don't
think<00:01:05.280> there's<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> single<00:01:05.869> color<00:01:06.869> application

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
think there's a single color application

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
think there's a single color application
that<00:01:07.650> they're<00:01:07.799> missing<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.030> case<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that they're missing and in this case of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
that they're missing and in this case of
course<00:01:09.420> sometimes<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.320> seals<00:01:10.710> down

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
course sometimes they use seals down

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
course sometimes they use seals down
here<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> ankles<00:01:11.729> legs<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.689> trim<00:01:12.960> on

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
here on the ankles legs and the trim on

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
here on the ankles legs and the trim on
the<00:01:13.200> armor<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.220> overall<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.909> no

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the armor but overall I have no

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
the armor but overall I have no
complaint<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.020> capture<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> exact

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
complaint because they capture the exact

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.690 
complaint because they capture the exact
feeling<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.750> anime<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:20.130> figure<00:01:20.580> that's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
feeling of the anime in a figure that's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
feeling of the anime in a figure that's
only<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.090> 1213<00:01:21.960> centimeters<00:01:22.470> tall<00:01:22.710> which

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
only about 1213 centimeters tall which

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
only about 1213 centimeters tall which
is<00:01:23.040> pretty<00:01:23.369> impressive<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> after<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> old

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
is pretty impressive so after the old

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
is pretty impressive so after the old
snap<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> finger<00:01:26.430> though<00:01:26.610> where<00:01:27.090> ever

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
snap of the finger though where ever

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
snap of the finger though where ever
Dolan<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.990> off<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
Dolan was off to you're just going to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
Dolan was off to you're just going to
transform<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.500> bending<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.890> down

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
transform this by just bending that down

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270 
transform this by just bending that down
and<00:01:32.369> plug<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> into<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:35.159> you'll

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and plug it into the back and you'll

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.249 
and plug it into the back and you'll
notice<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> chest<00:01:35.970> pops<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.689> now

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
notice that the chest pops out and now

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.560 
notice that the chest pops out and now
he's<00:01:37.590> ready<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.130> once<00:01:39.060> you've<00:01:39.240> plugged<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
he's ready to go once you've plugged in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.700 
he's ready to go once you've plugged in
the<00:01:39.659> core<00:01:39.840> Lander<00:01:40.200> you'll<00:01:40.350> notice<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the core Lander you'll notice that

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
the core Lander you'll notice that
there's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.369> bulk<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.540> way

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
there's a little bit more bulk this way

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
there's a little bit more bulk this way
in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.439> god<00:01:43.619> Gundam<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:44.070> otherwise<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
in the god Gundam which otherwise is a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
in the god Gundam which otherwise is a
pretty<00:01:45.030> small<00:01:45.540> Gundam<00:01:45.960> especially

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
pretty small Gundam especially

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
pretty small Gundam especially
considering<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> fact<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> doesn't

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
considering the fact that it doesn't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
considering the fact that it doesn't
have<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> whole<00:01:47.970> bunch<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> weapons<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
have a whole bunch of weapons that you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
have a whole bunch of weapons that you
attach<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> thing<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.909> am

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
attach to it but the thing that I am

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
attach to it but the thing that I am
most<00:01:51.210> pleased<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.020> course<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
most pleased about is of course if you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
most pleased about is of course if you
just<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.909> old<00:01:54.060> thinking<00:01:54.479> cap<00:01:54.659> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just use your your old thinking cap that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.389 
just use your your old thinking cap that
you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.229> swap<00:01:55.409> those<00:01:55.649> two<00:01:55.860> parts<00:01:56.130> around

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you can just swap those two parts around

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
you can just swap those two parts around
and<00:01:56.640> make<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> core<00:01:57.420> lander<00:01:57.840> look<00:01:58.020> poor<00:01:58.320> at

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and make the core lander look poor at

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.670 
and make the core lander look poor at
the<00:01:59.240> well<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> benefit<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.170> making<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the well with the benefit of making the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.920 
the well with the benefit of making the
god<00:02:01.890> Gundam<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.420> better<00:02:03.600> in

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
god Gundam look a little bit better in

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.690 
god Gundam look a little bit better in
the<00:02:04.320> front<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> course<00:02:05.130> I'm<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the front but of course I'm going to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
the front but of course I'm going to
keep<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:06.030> wings<00:02:06.299> spread<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.170> you'll

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
keep these wings spread out where you'll

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.559 
keep these wings spread out where you'll
notice<00:02:07.469> them<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.250> lot<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:09.060> than<00:02:09.270> when<00:02:09.420> they're

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
notice them a lot more than when they're

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.260 
notice them a lot more than when they're
in<00:02:09.660> their<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:10.020> position<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.879> terms<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.090> Poe's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
in their down position in terms of Poe's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
in their down position in terms of Poe's
abilities<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.020> far<00:02:13.260> everything

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
abilities so far everything

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
abilities so far everything
is<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.340> well<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.910> waist<00:02:15.120> skirt<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
is going really well the waist skirt of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
is going really well the waist skirt of
course<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.140> come<00:02:16.320> up<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.890> way

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
course can come up and out of the way

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.410 
course can come up and out of the way
and<00:02:17.190> you'll<00:02:17.340> notice<00:02:17.490> here<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> first<00:02:18.270> thing

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
and you'll notice here the first thing

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.300 
and you'll notice here the first thing
that<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.570> really<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.650> lot<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.010> times<00:02:20.190> you

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
that I really like is a lot of times you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.400 
that I really like is a lot of times you
try<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.490> bend<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> legs<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> riding

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
try to bend the legs out just to riding

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.290 
try to bend the legs out just to riding
trying<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> cool<00:02:23.430> pose<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> feet

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
trying to get a cool pose with the feet

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.820 
trying to get a cool pose with the feet
so<00:02:24.510> they're<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.810> pointing<00:02:25.350> forward

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
so they're not just pointing forward

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.920 
so they're not just pointing forward
like<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.520> penguin<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.360> case<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.780> can

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
like a penguin but in this case you can

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
like a penguin but in this case you can
just<00:02:28.110> pivot<00:02:28.380> them<00:02:28.530> here<00:02:28.890> no<00:02:29.490> problems<00:02:29.880> at<00:02:30.000> all

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
just pivot them here no problems at all

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.690 
just pivot them here no problems at all
so<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> legs<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.870> kick<00:02:31.050> forward<00:02:31.350> then<00:02:32.280> back

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
so the legs can kick forward then back

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.060 
so the legs can kick forward then back
and<00:02:33.030> terms<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.780> off<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.110> side<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.770> side

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
and terms of off to the side this side

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.940 
and terms of off to the side this side
armer<00:02:35.490> will<00:02:35.730> flip<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.390> enough<00:02:36.630> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
armer will flip up just enough and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
armer will flip up just enough and
you're<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.310> able<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.520> bend<00:02:38.730> them<00:02:38.850> up

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you're going to be able to bend them up

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.260 
you're going to be able to bend them up
about<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.870> much<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:41.280> rear<00:02:41.520> skirt<00:02:41.820> bends<00:02:42.180> up

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
about this much the rear skirt bends up

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.060 
about this much the rear skirt bends up
this<00:02:42.480> much<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.020> if<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.380> bring<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.770> forward

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you can bend it down and back without

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.110 
you can bend it down and back without
too<00:02:46.620> many<00:02:46.710> problems<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.670> already<00:02:47.820> saw

after-war gundam x which came out last
month<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:21.209> course<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.540> god<00:03:21.690> got<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:22.050> on

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
month and of course the god got them on

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.290 
month and of course the god got them on
the<00:03:22.260> right<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.100> god<00:03:23.250> gundam<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.820> sixteen

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
the right and the god gundam is sixteen

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.770 
the right and the god gundam is sixteen
point<00:03:24.330> six<00:03:24.870> meters<00:03:25.050> tall<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.280> head<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
point six meters tall and the head is a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.690 
point six meters tall and the head is a
fair<00:03:28.350> bit<00:03:28.470> taller<00:03:28.739> especially<00:03:29.250> when<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.489> take

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
fair bit taller especially when you take

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.300 
fair bit taller especially when you take
into<00:03:29.760> account<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:31.110> v<00:03:31.290> fins<00:03:31.590> or<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.890> double<00:03:32.160> v

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
into account the v fins or the double v

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.460 
into account the v fins or the double v
fins<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.940> case<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.900> course<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.290> X

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
fins in this case but of course the X

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.040 
fins in this case but of course the X
wins<00:03:34.800> once<00:03:35.520> you<00:03:35.700> include<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.600> satellite

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
wins once you include the satellite

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.170 
wins once you include the satellite
cannon<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:38.130> back<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:38.610> overall<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.000> think

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
cannon on the back but overall I think

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.880 
cannon on the back but overall I think
they<00:03:39.420> got<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.750> size<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.200> these<00:03:40.320> two<00:03:40.530> models

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
they got the size of these two models

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.070 
they got the size of these two models
both<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.640> right<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.570> god<00:03:42.720> Gundam

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
both just right and the god Gundam

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.570 
both just right and the god Gundam
you'll<00:03:43.200> notice<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> X<00:03:43.770> comes<00:03:43.980> across<00:03:44.280> as

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
you'll notice that the X comes across as

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.400 
you'll notice that the X comes across as
being<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.850> little<00:03:45.030> bit<00:03:45.180> skinny<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.260> god

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
being a little bit skinny and the god

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.380 
being a little bit skinny and the god
Gundam<00:03:46.770> really<00:03:47.070> comes<00:03:47.280> across<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.850> being<00:03:47.880> a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
Gundam really comes across as being a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.150 
Gundam really comes across as being a
little<00:03:48.870> bit<00:03:48.959> more<00:03:49.230> filled<00:03:49.590> out<00:03:49.800> which<00:03:50.040> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
little bit more filled out which is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.560 
little bit more filled out which is
something<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.610> usually<00:03:50.790> associate<00:03:51.540> with

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
something you usually associate with

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.120 
something you usually associate with
shining<00:03:52.200> well<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.590> anyway

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
shining well I do anyway

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.330 
shining well I do anyway
as<00:03:53.190> opposed<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.810> mid-season<00:03:55.260> god<00:03:55.770> upgrade

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
as opposed to the mid-season god upgrade

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.610 
as opposed to the mid-season god upgrade
so<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.690> might<00:03:57.810> be<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.989> little<00:03:58.110> bit<00:03:58.320> hard

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
so I think it might be a little bit hard

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.590 
so I think it might be a little bit hard
to<00:03:58.680> call<00:03:58.980> yourself<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.459> fan<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.850> Gundam<00:04:00.239> models

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
to call yourself a fan of Gundam models

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.030 
to call yourself a fan of Gundam models
if<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.840> don't<00:04:01.020> like<00:04:01.260> her<00:04:01.500> or<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:01.860> least

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
if you don't like her or at least

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.920 
if you don't like her or at least
appreciate<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.970> high<00:04:03.120> grade<00:04:03.330> universal

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
appreciate what the high grade universal

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.500 
appreciate what the high grade universal
century<00:04:04.200> line<00:04:04.620> has<00:04:04.890> brought<00:04:05.220> model<00:04:06.000> fans<00:04:06.239> over

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
century line has brought model fans over

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.780 
century line has brought model fans over
the<00:04:06.600> last<00:04:06.780> decade<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.400> fact<00:04:08.610> now

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the last decade but just the fact now

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.180 
the last decade but just the fact now
that<00:04:08.820> we<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.270> add<00:04:09.390> these<00:04:09.630> two<00:04:09.890> with<00:04:10.890> their

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
that we can add these two with their

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.340 
that we can add these two with their
fantastic<00:04:11.670> coloring<00:04:12.480> they're<00:04:12.810> all<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.140> great

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
fantastic coloring they're all the great

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.259 
fantastic coloring they're all the great
articulation<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> level<00:04:15.120> of

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
articulation and just the level of

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.849 
articulation and just the level of
attention<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.810> Bandai<00:04:16.230> has<00:04:16.410> paid<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.739> them

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
attention that Bandai has paid to them

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.099 
attention that Bandai has paid to them
is<00:04:16.980> just<00:04:17.640> fantastic<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.810> it's<00:04:18.930> something

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
is just fantastic and it's something

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.530 
is just fantastic and it's something
that<00:04:19.260> really<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.709> year<00:04:19.980> or<00:04:20.130> two<00:04:20.280> ago<00:04:20.459> was<00:04:21.180> almost

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
that really a year or two ago was almost

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.170 
that really a year or two ago was almost
unimaginable<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:23.100> now<00:04:23.280> our<00:04:23.310> shells<00:04:23.760> are<00:04:23.940> just

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
unimaginable but now our shells are just

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.910 
unimaginable but now our shells are just
that<00:04:24.450> much<00:04:24.690> better<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.260> we're

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
that much better and we're

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.440 
that much better and we're
really<00:04:26.370> waiting<00:04:26.640> for<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.820> whole<00:04:27.030> bunch<00:04:27.270> of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
really waiting for a whole bunch of

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.260 
really waiting for a whole bunch of
allies<00:04:27.930> for<00:04:28.290> all<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.530> these<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.790> wing<00:04:30.000> and

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
allies for all of these and the wing and

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.380 
allies for all of these and the wing and
turn<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:31.080> kits<00:04:31.410> as<00:04:31.620> well

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
turn a kits as well

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.240 
turn a kits as well
now<00:04:33.390> usually<00:04:33.630> weaponizing<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.620> Gundam<00:04:34.980> can<00:04:35.130> be

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
now usually weaponizing a Gundam can be

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.340 
now usually weaponizing a Gundam can be
a<00:04:35.280> little<00:04:35.490> bit<00:04:35.700> complicated<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.990> this

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
a little bit complicated but in this

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.620 
a little bit complicated but in this
case<00:04:37.650> well<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:38.610> not<00:04:38.760> at<00:04:38.910> all<00:04:38.970> so<00:04:39.330> anyway<00:04:39.570> you

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
case well it's not at all so anyway you

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.360 
case well it's not at all so anyway you
just<00:04:39.870> swap<00:04:40.080> out<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.380> fists<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.920> put<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.190> the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
just swap out the fists and put in the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.220 
just swap out the fists and put in the
manipulators<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.360> have<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.630> holes<00:04:42.840> there

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
manipulators that have the holes there

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.050 
manipulators that have the holes there
and<00:04:43.410> then<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:43.980> can<00:04:44.130> attach<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.670> two<00:04:44.820> beam

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
and then you can attach in the two beam

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.720 
and then you can attach in the two beam
sabers<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:46.110> because<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.650> overall<00:04:47.100> the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
sabers but because of the overall the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.340 
sabers but because of the overall the
great<00:04:48.090> possibility<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:48.930> kit<00:04:49.170> has

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
great possibility that this kit has

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.470 
great possibility that this kit has
really<00:04:50.280> there's<00:04:50.550> nothing<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.120> can't<00:04:51.330> do

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
really there's nothing that you can't do

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.540 
really there's nothing that you can't do
with<00:04:51.630> them<00:04:51.780> besides<00:04:52.170> bend<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.590> arm<00:04:52.770> more<00:04:53.400> than

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
with them besides bend the arm more than

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.910 
with them besides bend the arm more than
ninety<00:04:53.880> degrees<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.540> don't<00:04:55.350> know<00:04:55.440> if<00:04:55.560> there<00:04:55.740> was

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
ninety degrees I don't know if there was

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
the effect but of course if I watch a

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
Mon gets angry with the wings up at the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.430 
Mon gets angry with the wings up at the
back<00:05:53.700> which<00:05:53.970> really<00:05:54.240> add<00:05:54.480> to<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.900> impression

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
back which really add to the impression

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.320 
back which really add to the impression
of<00:05:55.560> size<00:05:55.860> there<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.490> then<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.030> end<00:05:57.180> up<00:05:57.270> just

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
of size there and then you end up just

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.390 
of size there and then you end up just
taking<00:05:57.870> off<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.260> forearm<00:05:58.830> guards<00:05:59.250> and

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
taking off the forearm guards and

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.700 
taking off the forearm guards and
flipping<00:05:59.790> them<00:05:59.940> forward<00:06:00.360> one<00:06:00.600> peg<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.290> I

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
flipping them forward one peg and I

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.870 
flipping them forward one peg and I
guess<00:06:01.890> I<00:06:02.010> should<00:06:02.160> open<00:06:02.340> up<00:06:02.430> those<00:06:02.610> yellow

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
guess I should open up those yellow

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.210 
guess I should open up those yellow
parts<00:06:03.180> but<00:06:03.420> I've<00:06:03.540> replaced<00:06:03.930> these<00:06:04.170> what<00:06:05.100> are

all the difference and they could have

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.070 
all the difference and they could have
