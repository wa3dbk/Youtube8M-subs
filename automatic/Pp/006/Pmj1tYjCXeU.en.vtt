00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
changed the way that I carry it up just

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.740 
changed the way that I carry it up just
a<00:01:38.440> little<00:01:38.470> bit<00:01:38.710> I've<00:01:38.950> changed<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:40.390> straps

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
that I used as I change my backpack so I

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.990 
that I used as I change my backpack so I
got<00:01:44.590> different<00:01:44.920> backpacks<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.520> course<00:01:45.760> I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
got different backpacks of course I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.850

kool-aid<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.680> I<00:01:50.920> showed<00:01:51.760> one<00:01:52.000> way<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.180> did

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
kool-aid in that I showed one way I did

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.420

by<00:02:02.080> Torben<00:02:02.770> Bo<00:02:03.130> Hanson<00:02:03.840> I'll<00:02:04.840> put<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.200> down

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
by Torben Bo Hanson I'll put that down

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.680 
by Torben Bo Hanson I'll put that down
at<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.620> bottom<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.070> screen<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:07.390> anyway

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
at the bottom of the screen but anyway

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.479 
at the bottom of the screen but anyway
he<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.410> one<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.769> originally<00:02:09.220> got<00:02:09.340> this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
he is the one that I originally got this

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.390 
he is the one that I originally got this
idea<00:02:09.700> from<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.330> this<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.660> not<00:02:10.869> my<00:02:11.080> idea<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:12.340> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
idea from so this is not my idea this is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.060 
idea from so this is not my idea this is
just<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:13.000> copied<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.690> from<00:02:13.990> him<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.980> don't

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
just I copied this from him and I don't

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.420 
just I copied this from him and I don't
know<00:02:15.250> if<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.700> his<00:02:15.910> idea<00:02:15.940> or<00:02:16.360> what

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
know if this is his idea or what

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.009 
know if this is his idea or what
this<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.939> you<00:02:18.180> know<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:18.480> works<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
this is just you know what works and

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.069 
this is just you know what works and
it's<00:02:19.709> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.099> really<00:02:20.280> based<00:02:20.549> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> ula<00:02:21.239> so

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
it's kind of really based on the ula so

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.280 
it's kind of really based on the ula so
basically<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.980> order<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.750> for<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.900> system

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
basically in order for for this system

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.869 
basically in order for for this system
to<00:02:25.409> work<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.829> need<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.189> some<00:02:26.579> sort<00:02:26.819> of

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
to work you need to have some sort of

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.000 
to work you need to have some sort of
way<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.299> can<00:02:27.569> attach<00:02:27.870> chords<00:02:28.439> to<00:02:28.680> your

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
way that you can attach chords to your

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.670 
way that you can attach chords to your
backpack<00:02:29.489> strap<00:02:29.849> your<00:02:30.120> shoulder<00:02:30.450> strap<00:02:30.719> in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
backpack strap your shoulder strap in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.589 
backpack strap your shoulder strap in
this<00:02:31.890> case<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.519> daisy<00:02:32.819> chain<00:02:32.939> that<00:02:33.359> runs

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
this case I have a daisy chain that runs

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.229 
this case I have a daisy chain that runs
the<00:02:33.780> length<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.109> my<00:02:34.709> shoulder<00:02:35.639> strap<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.120> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the length of my shoulder strap and it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.300 
the length of my shoulder strap and it
works<00:02:36.389> out<00:02:36.569> well<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.260> also<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.980> need<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
works out well because also you need to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.160 
works out well because also you need to
depend<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.269> sort<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.569> bottle<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.049> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
depend on what sort of bottle that you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.690 
depend on what sort of bottle that you
use<00:02:40.379> you'll<00:02:40.530> need<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.799> be<00:02:40.920> able<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.159> space<00:02:41.459> it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
use you'll need to be able to space it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.339 
use you'll need to be able to space it
the<00:02:42.090> appropriate<00:02:42.599> height<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.989> that's<00:02:43.139> just

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
the appropriate height and that's just

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.569 
the appropriate height and that's just
something<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.680> you're<00:02:43.859> just<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.189> to<00:02:44.280> play

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
something that you're just going to play

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.619 
something that you're just going to play
with<00:02:45.829> all<00:02:46.829> I<00:02:46.889> did<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.430> take<00:02:47.639> this<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.420> just

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
with all I did was take this is just

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.869 
with all I did was take this is just
some<00:02:48.780> shock<00:02:49.049> cord<00:02:49.379> as<00:02:49.889> you<00:02:50.099> can<00:02:50.250> see<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.489> think

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
some shock cord as you can see I think

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.190 
some shock cord as you can see I think
it<00:02:51.000> might<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.209> 3/16<00:02:51.930> inch<00:02:52.139> shock<00:02:52.409> cord<00:02:52.939> and<00:02:54.200> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
it might be 3/16 inch shock cord and I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.069 
it might be 3/16 inch shock cord and I
just<00:02:55.530> basically<00:02:55.950> looped<00:02:56.609> it<00:02:56.760> around<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.329> I

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
just basically looped it around and I

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.659 
just basically looped it around and I
just<00:02:58.109> tied<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> knot<00:02:58.829> in<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.099> as<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.549> see

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
just tied a knot in it as you can see

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.550 
just tied a knot in it as you can see
there<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.359> just<00:03:00.389> trimmed<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.019> kind<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
there and then I just trimmed it kind of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.659 
there and then I just trimmed it kind of
melted<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:01.950> edges<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:03.599> all<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.260> does<00:03:04.669> this

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
melted the edges and all this does this

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.030 
melted the edges and all this does this
the<00:03:06.180> bottom<00:03:06.569> of<00:03:06.780> my<00:03:07.109> bottle<00:03:07.439> which<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.769> usually

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the bottom of my bottle which I usually

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.089 
the bottom of my bottle which I usually
use<00:03:08.430> these<00:03:08.760> 20<00:03:09.150> ounce<00:03:09.329> Gatorade<00:03:09.810> bottles<00:03:10.200> but

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
use these 20 ounce Gatorade bottles but

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.459 
use these 20 ounce Gatorade bottles but
the<00:03:11.189> bottom<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.639> my<00:03:11.760> bottle<00:03:12.150> will<00:03:13.019> just<00:03:13.260> fit

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
the bottom of my bottle will just fit

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.800 
the bottom of my bottle will just fit
right<00:03:13.739> in<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.189> I<00:03:14.489> don't<00:03:15.090> worry<00:03:15.269> about<00:03:15.450> using

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
right in there I don't worry about using

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.839 
right in there I don't worry about using
locks<00:03:16.109> or<00:03:16.319> anything<00:03:16.469> like<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.189> tied<00:03:17.430> so

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
locks or anything like that it's tied so

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.059 
locks or anything like that it's tied so
that<00:03:17.969> it's<00:03:18.120> tight<00:03:18.299> enough<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.780> all<00:03:19.409> this<00:03:19.709> cord

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
that it's tight enough and all this cord

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.670 
that it's tight enough and all this cord
really<00:03:20.430> does<00:03:20.639> here<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.299> stabilize<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.470> it's

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
really does here is stabilize it so it's

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.559 
really does here is stabilize it so it's
not<00:03:22.799> flopping<00:03:23.220> around<00:03:23.459> back<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:23.940> forth<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
not flopping around back and forth and

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.439 
not flopping around back and forth and
all<00:03:24.659> that<00:03:24.810> good<00:03:24.959> stuff<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:27.030> part<00:03:27.269> that

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
all that good stuff on the part that

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.879 
all that good stuff on the part that
actually<00:03:27.569> does<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.229> work<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.799> to

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
actually does all the work is going to

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.699 
actually does all the work is going to
be<00:03:28.979> the<00:03:29.099> top<00:03:29.310> straps<00:03:29.669> which<00:03:30.329> are<00:03:30.479> these<00:03:30.629> here

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
be the top straps which are these here

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.589 
be the top straps which are these here
I've<00:03:31.709> got<00:03:31.949> two<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.220> them<00:03:32.489> no<00:03:33.209> particular

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
I've got two of them no particular

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.759 
I've got two of them no particular
reason<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:34.019> there<00:03:34.139> are<00:03:34.229> different<00:03:34.470> colors

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
reason that there are different colors

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.289 
reason that there are different colors
other<00:03:35.040> than<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> fact<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.699> that's<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
other than the fact that that's just the

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.899 
other than the fact that that's just the
color<00:03:36.680> cord<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:37.979> ground<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.489> use<00:03:38.760> them

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
color cord then I ground out to use them

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.830 
color cord then I ground out to use them
with<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.359> all<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.199> did<00:03:40.560> as<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:42.060> tied<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.299> loop<00:03:42.629> in

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
with and all I did as I tied a loop in

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.259 
with and all I did as I tied a loop in
one<00:03:42.989> end<00:03:43.319> as<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:44.010> see<00:03:44.189> there<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.639> on<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
one end as you can see there and on the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.059 
one end as you can see there and on the
other<00:03:45.389> end<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.840> just<00:03:45.870> attached<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.560> mitten<00:03:46.889> hook

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
other end I just attached a mitten hook

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.069 
other end I just attached a mitten hook
and<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.400> just<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:48.269> believe<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.900> actually

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
and that's just I believe I actually

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.229 
and that's just I believe I actually
tied<00:03:49.439> a<00:03:49.470> loop<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.099> threaded<00:03:50.909> it<00:03:51.030> through

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
tied a loop and threaded it through

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.460 
tied a loop and threaded it through
there<00:03:51.419> so<00:03:51.720> it's<00:03:51.870> not<00:03:52.019> going<00:03:52.199> to<00:03:52.259> come<00:03:52.439> loose

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
there so it's not going to come loose

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.659 
there so it's not going to come loose
and<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:54.180> way<00:03:54.299> this<00:03:54.479> works<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:55.109> I've<00:03:56.009> made<00:03:56.519> it

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
and the way this works is I've made it

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.339 
and the way this works is I've made it
long<00:03:56.849> enough<00:03:57.120> like<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.449> said<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:57.689> use<00:03:57.959> these<00:03:58.139> get

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
long enough like I said I use these get

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.960 
long enough like I said I use these get
red<00:03:58.530> balls<00:03:58.709> if<00:03:58.979> you<00:03:59.099> use<00:03:59.280> something<00:03:59.519> different

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
red balls if you use something different

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.399 
red balls if you use something different
you<00:04:00.030> may<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.389> play<00:04:00.629> around<00:04:00.780> with<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.199> see

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
you may have to play around with it see

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.420 
you may have to play around with it see
what<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.560> can<00:04:01.739> get<00:04:01.949> but<00:04:02.729> all<00:04:02.879> I<00:04:02.909> do<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.479> I<00:04:04.439> put

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
what you can get but all I do is I put

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.640 
what you can get but all I do is I put
it<00:04:05.579> around<00:04:05.939> underneath<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.870> little<00:04:07.139> lip<00:04:07.349> and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
it around underneath that little lip and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.039 
it around underneath that little lip and
then<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> run<00:04:08.729> the<00:04:08.939> mitten<00:04:09.239> hook<00:04:09.389> through<00:04:09.900> that

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
then I run the mitten hook through that

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.499 
then I run the mitten hook through that
loop<00:04:10.259> and<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:11.370> locks<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.879> down<00:04:11.909> right<00:04:12.299> there

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
loop and that locks it down right there

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.409 
loop and that locks it down right there
and<00:04:12.689> then<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.919> actually<00:04:14.220> make<00:04:15.150> sure<00:04:15.329> you

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
and then that is actually make sure you

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.710 
and then that is actually make sure you
can<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> video<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:18.419> right

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
can see that on the video this right

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.580 
can see that on the video this right
here<00:04:19.079> is<00:04:19.409> actually<00:04:19.709> what<00:04:20.220> carries<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:20.970> weight

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
here is actually what carries the weight

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.129 
here is actually what carries the weight
of<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.099> water<00:04:23.310> bottle<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.849> since<00:04:24.720> it's<00:04:24.930> run

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
of the water bottle and since it's run

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.750 
of the water bottle and since it's run
through<00:04:25.409> there<00:04:25.620> it's<00:04:25.860> locked<00:04:26.159> it's<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.580> going

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
through there it's locked it's not going

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.430 
through there it's locked it's not going
to<00:04:26.820> loosen<00:04:27.000> up<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.419> can<00:04:27.719> it<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:27.990> it's<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.229> going

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
to loosen up on can it so it's not going

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.550 
to loosen up on can it so it's not going
to<00:04:28.500> fall<00:04:28.710> out<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.190> also<00:04:29.729> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
to fall out and also the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.250 
to fall out and also the
spectra<00:04:30.950> cord<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.790> kind<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:33.050> got<00:04:33.230> a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
spectra cord is is kind of it's got a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.780 
spectra cord is is kind of it's got a
lot<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.500> memory<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.580> it

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
lot of memory to it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.500 
lot of memory to it
it's<00:04:35.419> stiff<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.430> doesn't<00:04:37.790> really<00:04:37.940> fall<00:04:38.240> off

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
it's stiff so it doesn't really fall off

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.720 
it's stiff so it doesn't really fall off
whenever<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.990> take<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.350> off<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.770> take<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.460> drink

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
whenever I take it off to a take a drink

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.180 
whenever I take it off to a take a drink
or<00:04:40.880> whatever<00:04:41.410> then<00:04:42.410> all<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.560> do<00:04:42.740> while<00:04:43.100> I'm

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
or whatever then all I do while I'm

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.240 
or whatever then all I do while I'm
wearing<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.550> backpack<00:04:44.710> like<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.860> said<00:04:46.070> this

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
wearing the backpack like I said this

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.830 
wearing the backpack like I said this
backpack<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:46.910> happen<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.300> have<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.450> daisy<00:04:47.720> chain

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
backpack it happen to have a daisy chain

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.440 
backpack it happen to have a daisy chain
on<00:04:48.230> it<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.889> just<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.220> happens<00:04:49.639> that<00:04:49.760> if

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
on it and it just so happens that if

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.840 
on it and it just so happens that if
I'll<00:04:50.720> put<00:04:51.080> this<00:04:51.440> mitten<00:04:51.800> hook<00:04:51.980> loop<00:04:52.700> it

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
I'll put this mitten hook loop it

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.360 
I'll put this mitten hook loop it
through<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.240> top<00:04:53.510> strap<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.590> very<00:04:54.830> top<00:04:55.070> one

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
through that top strap the very top one

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.390 
through that top strap the very top one
on<00:04:55.400> my<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.300> Z<00:04:56.540> paying<00:04:56.780> zero<00:04:57.050> pac<00:04:57.380> loop<00:04:58.250> it

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
on my this is Z paying zero pac loop it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.310 
on my this is Z paying zero pac loop it
through<00:04:58.430> there<00:04:58.760> then<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.780> bottom<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.169> this

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
through there then the bottom of this

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.219 
through there then the bottom of this
this<00:05:00.620> goes<00:05:00.889> on<00:05:01.070> there<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:02.060> fits<00:05:02.330> pretty

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
this goes on there and it fits pretty

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.260 
this goes on there and it fits pretty
dang<00:05:03.500> perfectly<00:05:04.040> as<00:05:04.340> far<00:05:04.550> as<00:05:04.669> I'm<00:05:04.820> concerned

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
dang perfectly as far as I'm concerned

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.930 
dang perfectly as far as I'm concerned
so<00:05:05.510> then<00:05:06.169> your<00:05:06.740> drink<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.250> hanging<00:05:07.580> from<00:05:07.610> this

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
so then your drink is hanging from this

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.240 
so then your drink is hanging from this
loop<00:05:08.180> up<00:05:08.389> here<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.840> it's<00:05:09.410> secured<00:05:09.800> down<00:05:10.010> here

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
loop up here and it's secured down here

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.620 
loop up here and it's secured down here
of<00:05:10.400> course<00:05:10.669> this<00:05:10.760> is<00:05:10.880> kind<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:11.120> floppy<00:05:11.389> right

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
of course this is kind of floppy right

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.719 
of course this is kind of floppy right
here<00:05:11.810> because<00:05:12.050> I'm<00:05:12.169> not<00:05:12.200> wearing<00:05:12.530> it<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:13.460> once

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
here because I'm not wearing it but once

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.400 
here because I'm not wearing it but once
I<00:05:13.850> put<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.120> on<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.419> does<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.600> lot<00:05:14.870> better<00:05:15.110> and

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
I put it on it does a lot better and

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.850 
I put it on it does a lot better and
that's<00:05:16.220> basically<00:05:16.850> all<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.180> do<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.840> mean<00:05:18.650> there's

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
that's basically all I do I mean there's

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.680 
that's basically all I do I mean there's
not<00:05:19.010> a<00:05:19.070> whole<00:05:19.460> lot<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:19.970> really<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.510> system

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
not a whole lot to it really the system

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.020 
not a whole lot to it really the system
doesn't<00:05:21.169> weigh<00:05:21.290> much<00:05:21.490> these<00:05:22.490> mitten<00:05:22.850> hooks

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
doesn't weigh much these mitten hooks

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.400 
doesn't weigh much these mitten hooks

that the that the length of both of
these<00:05:50.180> cords<00:05:50.690> were<00:05:50.840> about<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.260> same<00:05:51.880> you<00:05:52.880> know

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
these cords were about the same you know

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.510 
these cords were about the same you know
they're<00:05:53.270> not<00:05:53.390> 100%<00:05:54.200> perfect<00:05:54.410> but<00:05:55.310> they<00:05:55.490> are

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
they're not 100% perfect but they are

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.600 
they're not 100% perfect but they are
pretty<00:05:55.910> damn<00:05:56.210> close<00:05:56.510> to<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.840> same<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.410> way

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
pretty damn close to the same that way

pretty damn close to the same that way
each<00:05:58.610> bottle<00:05:59.180> is<00:05:59.300> hanging<00:05:59.690> about<00:05:59.840> the<00:05:59.990> same

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
each bottle is hanging about the same

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.340 
each bottle is hanging about the same
distance<00:06:00.560> off<00:06:00.770> of<00:06:00.950> each<00:06:01.100> shoulder<00:06:01.370> strap<00:06:01.760> and

distance off of each shoulder strap and
guys<00:06:03.350> that's<00:06:03.590> pretty<00:06:03.710> much<00:06:04.010> it<00:06:04.250> on<00:06:04.520> these<00:06:04.940> I

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
guys that's pretty much it on these I

these all four setups and basically
that's<00:06:22.729> how<00:06:22.910> attach<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.539> so<00:06:24.169> guys<00:06:24.380> it's<00:06:25.310> not

that's how attach it so guys it's not

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.279 
that's how attach it so guys it's not
real<00:06:25.669> hard<00:06:25.850> to<00:06:26.030> make<00:06:26.539> obviously<00:06:27.020> as<00:06:27.139> you<00:06:27.260> can

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
real hard to make obviously as you can

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.129 
real hard to make obviously as you can
tell<00:06:27.639> and<00:06:28.639> also<00:06:28.970> as<00:06:29.060> you<00:06:29.180> can<00:06:29.210> see<00:06:29.360> this<00:06:29.900> loop

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
tell and also as you can see this loop

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.040 
tell and also as you can see this loop
here<00:06:30.470> is<00:06:30.620> bigger<00:06:30.889> than<00:06:31.190> this<00:06:31.850> loop<00:06:32.120> however

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
here is bigger than this loop however

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.260 
here is bigger than this loop however
the<00:06:33.620> size<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:34.039> loop<00:06:34.220> doesn't<00:06:34.669> matter

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
the size the loop doesn't matter

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.550 
the size the loop doesn't matter
matters<00:06:35.780> is<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.320> overall<00:06:36.890> length<00:06:37.190> of<00:06:37.460> the<00:06:37.640> to

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
matters is the overall length of the to

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.900 
matters is the overall length of the to
many<00:06:39.560> white<00:06:39.740> guys<00:06:39.920> that's<00:06:40.190> it

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
many white guys that's it

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.910 
many white guys that's it
pretty<00:06:41.360> easy<00:06:41.540> pretty<00:06:41.870> inexpensive<00:06:42.620> to<00:06:42.710> make

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
pretty easy pretty inexpensive to make

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.150 
pretty easy pretty inexpensive to make
and<00:06:43.190> it<00:06:44.150> works<00:06:44.330> really<00:06:44.570> well<00:06:44.660> these<00:06:45.080> for<00:06:45.320> me<00:06:45.440> so
