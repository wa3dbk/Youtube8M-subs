00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.570
 no, we are not going 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.790
 how 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.519
 Y 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.450
 We have a series of issues and I hope that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.420
 among all we are able to find 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.240
 the best solution and we want to make a 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 Hotel everything goes wrong and you who want 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.920
 build or I do not have the option of the hotel 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.590
 big would be too much would be too much 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.830
 extensive what I would ask is that not 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.670
 was in the old port because 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.670
 it is right in front of the school 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 we did not do the metal 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 we could not give all sides of everything 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 but citizens if it is not so much so 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 what do you do if not for what 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.619
 make the 450 people who come 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 our serious problems came in the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.409
 unemployment and in the hope of life we ​​do not go 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 to have food to serve them in which 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 are a group which is then has 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.560
 indicators that are damaged 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 obviously but somehow we are 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.399
 improving the economy 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.980
 I think this fits quite well with what 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.860
 you want good 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.130
 we have the yellow ball as we have 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.320
 significantly improved life cost is 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.850
 it has worsened a bit but we are still 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.970
 alive 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.140
 and now you have a role that is different 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 to yours of the day daily forces you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.430
 rather to try to see the point of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.560
 view of another person who would not have 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.730
 probably nothing to do with you but 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 above all it is very interesting to see the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 others see how others develop 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.950
 also their roles see exactly which 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 is your position is difficult because in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.790
 general people do not move from their 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.700
 posture and with this game you realize 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.860
 that you 're not just you but that there's more 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.550
 people and then when you leave the room 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.680
 and you think a little you think that has 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.410
 some relationship with the life of the mayor 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.660
 but with your non-personal life this 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.060
 is real life, that is to reach consensus 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.260
 in which each one has his position and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.260
 you have to bring them closer together
