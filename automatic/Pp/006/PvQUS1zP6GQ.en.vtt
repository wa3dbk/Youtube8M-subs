in this series I'll be showing you how
to<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.609> 2d<00:00:21.480> game<00:00:21.810> development<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> we'll<00:00:23.670> be

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to do 2d game development and we'll be

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.080 
to do 2d game development and we'll be
using<00:00:23.939> Java<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.800> goal<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.519> able<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> use

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
using Java the goal is to be able to use

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.070 
using Java the goal is to be able to use
the<00:00:27.449> same<00:00:27.689> code<00:00:27.960> base<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.760> deploy<00:00:29.760> games<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the same code base to deploy games to a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.690 
the same code base to deploy games to a
browser<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.690> using<00:00:33.690> html5<00:00:34.700> but

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
browser like this using html5 but

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
browser like this using html5 but

toolkit and also with the same code base
and<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> same<00:00:42.210> framework<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.020> we'll

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and with the same framework that we'll

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.709 
and with the same framework that we'll
be<00:00:43.410> developing<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> tutorials<00:00:44.910> we'll

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
be developing in the tutorials we'll

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.569 
be developing in the tutorials we'll
also<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.110> able<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.440> deploy<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> games<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.550> the

also be able to deploy the games to the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.709 
also be able to deploy the games to the
Android<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:49.020> regular<00:00:49.230> Java<00:00:50.539> which<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Android and just regular Java which you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.540 
Android and just regular Java which you
can<00:00:51.899> also<00:00:52.050> deploy<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> browser<00:00:53.160> using

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
can also deploy to a browser using

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
can also deploy to a browser using
applets<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> quick<00:00:55.530> demo<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
applets so this is just a quick demo I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.819 
applets so this is just a quick demo I
was<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.730> playing<00:00:56.969> around<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.079> width

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
was just playing around in the width

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.599 
was just playing around in the width
version<00:00:59.280> just<00:01:00.180> working<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.100> part<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> 2d

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
version just working on part of the 2d

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
version just working on part of the 2d
renderer<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.140> playing<00:01:04.409> around

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
renderer that I was just playing around

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.740 
renderer that I was just playing around
with<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.560> hopefully<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.070> video<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.060> little

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
with so hopefully this video this little

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830 
with so hopefully this video this little
demo<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.979> pique<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.250> interest<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
demo will pique your interest and it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.179 
demo will pique your interest and it
will<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.140> coming<00:01:13.290> back<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.770> more

lesson slowly and progressive so if
you're<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> novice<00:01:32.659> programmer<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.290> don't

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
you're a novice programmer if you don't

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010 
you're a novice programmer if you don't
even<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.829> Java<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.430> much<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.659> series

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
even know Java that much this series

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.260 
even know Java that much this series
should<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.770> pretty<00:01:37.950> helpful<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.060> you're

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
should be pretty helpful and if you're

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.149 
should be pretty helpful and if you're
more<00:01:39.420> experienced<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.350> should<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:41.100> able

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
more experienced you should also be able

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
more experienced you should also be able
to<00:01:41.340> learn<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.720> or<00:01:42.840> two<00:01:42.899> about<00:01:43.079> game

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
to learn a thing or two about game

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490
