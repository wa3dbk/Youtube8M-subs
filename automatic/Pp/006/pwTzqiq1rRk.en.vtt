00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
about this particular application but I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.400 
about this particular application but I
would<00:02:41.430> say<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.180> was<00:02:42.360> certainly<00:02:43.230> worth

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
would say that it was certainly worth

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.460 
would say that it was certainly worth
the<00:02:43.769> cost<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.250> admission<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:46.140> should<00:02:46.319> get

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the cost of admission and you should get

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.220 
the cost of admission and you should get
it<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.880> playing<00:02:48.540> around<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:49.019> your

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
else I wanted to say about this

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.750 
else I wanted to say about this
particular<00:03:00.569> application<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.739> would<00:03:02.220> say<00:03:02.519> that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
particular application I would say that

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.120 
particular application I would say that
it<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.239> certainly<00:03:03.989> worth<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.380> cost<00:03:04.980> of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it was certainly worth the cost of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:23.810 
it was certainly worth the cost of
