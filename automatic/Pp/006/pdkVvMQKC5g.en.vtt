00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
had a lot of people talking to the next

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.910 
had a lot of people talking to the next
thing<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.480> LG<00:01:49.930> probably<00:01:50.320> spent<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.650> most

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
thing that LG probably spent the most

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.610 
thing that LG probably spent the most
time<00:01:51.100> about<00:01:51.610> on<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:52.060> phone<00:01:52.390> was<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.020> camera

time about on this phone was the camera
and<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.310> does<00:01:54.520> certainly<00:01:54.880> seem<00:01:55.480> justified<00:01:55.960> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
and it does certainly seem justified the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.740 
and it does certainly seem justified the
camera<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.460> g4<00:01:57.940> might<00:01:58.210> be<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.450> biggest

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
camera on the g4 might be the biggest

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.810
