bottle and if the blender ball wasn't in
there<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.620> come<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> exactly<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
there it would go come to exactly the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.299 
there it would go come to exactly the
8-ounce<00:00:39.000> line<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:40.079> half<00:00:40.320> way<00:00:40.649> which

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
8-ounce line which is a half way which

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.139
