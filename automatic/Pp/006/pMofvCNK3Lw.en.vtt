 you are going to stick your crack the you 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.979
 leave out 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.770

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.720
 go back in your back and she has 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.380
 launched patrick excuse if you return 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.050
 others in computer you double 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.030
 click on cd 2 as a gesture like 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.260
 had set for the installation you 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.450
 open back and crack 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.770
 you take it all and make you stick 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.220
 here you are that you are all going to 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.310
 copy is replaced all and for 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.810
 open the game it's very simple you 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.099
 already you launch a 01 savalan know m 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.819
 the update I think something 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:58.090
 like that and after that you raise this is 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:06:02.270
 you want either far cry 3 or 1.01 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.909
 and the judgment will be fine I repeat 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.069
 also that it really takes a beast for 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.440
 to make this game work this is it 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.539
 really needs a very very good in a 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.120
 very very good pc 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.550
 it requires a lot of resources I the 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.349
 see there the tutorial is over I hope that 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.139
