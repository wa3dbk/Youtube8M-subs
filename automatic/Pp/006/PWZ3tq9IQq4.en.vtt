thinking of making their new crossbow
casting<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.500> aluminium<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.060> would<00:03:09.180> be

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
casting out aluminium so it would be

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.770 
casting out aluminium so it would be
much<00:03:09.390> lighter<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.730> make<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.880> bow<00:03:12.239> out<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
much lighter and make the bow out of the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.580 
much lighter and make the bow out of the
spring<00:03:13.769> metal<00:03:14.070> out<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.049> car<00:03:16.049> leaks<00:03:16.260> Rome
