when<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.239> do<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.290> doors<00:02:27.709> if<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.160> are

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
when you do make the doors if you are

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
when you do make the doors if you are

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
trying to make shelves be prepared to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.680 
trying to make shelves be prepared to
anchor<00:02:33.530> them<00:02:33.709> because<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.520> weight<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
anchor them because the weight of the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.490 
anchor them because the weight of the
glass<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.850> heavy<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.420> your<00:02:38.930> shelf<00:02:39.260> will

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
glass is so heavy that your shelf will

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.070 
glass is so heavy that your shelf will
tilt<00:02:43.390> therefore<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.840> add<00:02:45.130> these<00:02:47.080> in

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
tilt therefore you have to add these in

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.830 
tilt therefore you have to add these in
them<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> actual<00:02:49.489> wall<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.100> won't

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
them to the actual wall so they won't

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.160 
them to the actual wall so they won't
lean<00:02:53.840> forward<00:02:54.319> when<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.560> open<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.980> door

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.970 
Donny my shredder my wrath
that<00:03:09.739> was<00:03:09.829> my<00:03:09.980> Mikey<00:03:13.480> ammonia<00:03:14.480> Nardo<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
that was my Mikey ammonia Nardo the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.650 
that was my Mikey ammonia Nardo the
reason<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.310> got<00:03:16.459> these<00:03:16.640> guys<00:03:16.820> sideways<00:03:17.480> is

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
reason I got these guys sideways is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.930 
reason I got these guys sideways is
because<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.560> sword<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:21.320> nunchuck<00:03:21.940> were

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
because the sword and the nunchuck were

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.970 
because the sword and the nunchuck were
the<00:03:23.060> arms<00:03:23.360> putting<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> weapons<00:03:24.140> they<00:03:24.739> come

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
the arms putting the weapons they come

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.819 
the arms putting the weapons they come
out<00:03:25.010> they<00:03:25.340> extend<00:03:25.670> too<00:03:25.820> long<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.500> they<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.739> to

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
out they extend too long so they have to

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.970 
out they extend too long so they have to
be<00:03:27.980> sideways<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:29.590> wish<00:03:30.590> they<00:03:30.769> were<00:03:30.829> all<00:03:30.920> like
