 everything seems normal 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.119
 but some consider that these positions 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.759
 they are a latent risk 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.060
 after the oil and all that 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.000

 to mitigate the risk 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 we interview when there is a question of gas lp 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.890
