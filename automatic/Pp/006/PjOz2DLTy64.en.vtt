00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.100
 so together, welcome here 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.650
 in my channel 83 meters and in this 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.240
 video I want you so yes one 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.280
 to express a recommendation or at all 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.980
 what to look for what is what 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.200
 a washing machine washing machine so sb 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.619
 I'm supposed to use a washing machine 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.199
 here with me in the place what park borat 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.090
 say gigantic empire and write 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 There were 12 3 boxes spring earlier 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 a quarter of the time was unfortunately 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.910
 closed three boxes one outside 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 are also many times larger is yes 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.620
 vehicles as well as ours behind must 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.470
 you see if you get the space since 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.420
 Well , the plant was so the has 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.199
 I just put the advantage to this right 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.760
 the time out 42 kilometers and I'm there 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.909
 At the same time I know the inhabitant council here 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379
 the owner of the car wash and 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.420
 for my own things take the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.449
 ever the first thing we have to wait 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.330
 do not allow anything that we have here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.580
 We also have a note here as a spox 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.080
 it is also allowed to leave 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.850
 No brought what kind of mothers 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.450
 is actually used 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.280
 but everyone thinks so 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 because many people then too 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.060
 aggressive products and so on 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.170
 I would know the owner 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.730
 accordingly, I have one here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.900
 Permit it to turn also that is 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.780
 absolutely no topic 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.210
 Of course, people are reluctant 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.190
 on the other hand, they ban that order 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.540
 those things that trouble from the 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.730
 Creating a world just talk openly 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.470
 I am allowed to do my own thing 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.090
 bring along shows the things sometimes 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.310
 acid-free, for example, in rim cleaner 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.980
 or so usually there is no one has 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.230
 say if that is not an asshole yes what 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.730
 is still important so the ground is here 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.570
 Absolutely not the best one has to 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.830
 clearly say that's just that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.020
 Washerlage is here or stop 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.270
 wash it keeps really old 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 that's right, but it's still her 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 best here in the area because there 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.940
 it's also significantly worse here 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.830
 this box, for example, we have one 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.440
 relatively new country that is itself very 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 good because that has a relatively short 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.120
 you are very well under control and the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.530
 works really very good and very 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.990
 exactly up here on this new one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 nozzle head that's alright 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.520
 of course she has it here, of course 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.780
 in the box so on the right side then 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.310
 this cruel part with brush this 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.780
 year is absolutely not interesting 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.590
 Accordingly, you really need it 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.370
 do not respond 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.720
 yes so good that now this ball 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.130
 because somehow what makes is my dare 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 not even a little bit on something 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.520
 respect, think highly of 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 yes and how often will you come here ? 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.090
 also the owner in the car wash 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.470
 month is here daily and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
 accordingly this is a real one 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.330
 fucked washing machine yes again 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.050
 So if you come up here , push 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.590
 you know it could be close or too 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.540
 closely 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.100
 yes here the box is quasi 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.980
 always mirrored to the right always the 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.600
 normal the normal pressure washer 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.370
 and here on the left we have 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.720
 the one with the brush so if we ourselves 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.910
 here to the right and we have one too 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.850
 he has a little land here in st 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.220
 3000 all recently installed that is 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.470
 Absolutely in order of things you can 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 really good work but as well 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.050
 here again 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.210
 in the middle of July okay but if you are 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.040
 Look at this collects here 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.330
 Of course that's pretty clear 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.070
 I live here a bit rural 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
 the gates of Cologne and accordingly 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.230
 of course many farmers are coming too 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.230
 who make their career came clean so 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.060
 this is this very old plant here 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.680
 Look what clear preserve me 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.150
 there is not at all but which one 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.410
 anyway only with clear which and ours 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.370
 own products work is that 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.020
 completely adequate 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.630
 in terms of price you have a bit too 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.400
 pay attention to the possibility of 50 cents 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.400
 To run euro 1 2 1 is at most 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.030
 so and here you get for 50 cents two 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.340
 minutes 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.410
 accordingly high four 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.060
 minutes with a euro and I believe 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.690
 even eight minutes would have to be with 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.890
 two Euro 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.720
 who over 50 cent for a minute 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.780
 I think and a euro for two 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.580
 minutes and 42 euros for four minutes me 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.260
 believe that it does not skin properly 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.500
 I think this is the course 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.970
 here in the box we are still looking 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.810
 my favorite box on or 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.590
 box is quasi cabriolet box the outdoor box 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.209
 and this in so far cool because 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.680
 is a bit more out here 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.240
 the fresh air is not so limited 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.250
 also has good light for the videos for 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.910
 Of course, that's important to you yes and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.250
 then we have this part here 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.660
 that is also from the people of the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.449
 pre-war period have a rotary switch 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.520
 which we can work on consume clearly 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.780
 We do not use games and shampoo 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.690
 is synonymous with me always on glass 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.220
 play price absolutely same why you 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.120
 here or I'll say I do not know 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.440
 maybe you can get some 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.850
 I'm here for free from him for free 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.889
 advertising for him make no idea 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.240
 yes, here we have one more unfortunately 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.889
 relatively all border 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.660
 we are such a huge thing so 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.880
 you have to be careful 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.840
 because when the pressure tends to subside 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.490
 Of course you do that a bit 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.610
 give in and then if you go against the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.110
 car pushes that is of course fatal but 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.610
 in the 100,000 people I already 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.389
 It has never been my life 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.229
 otherwise happened is that of the 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.550
 flooring also still the best somewhere 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.440
 I like to go there because of that 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.910
 with the others there is the dirt stop 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.160
 really we have also seen yes 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.330
 but otherwise only really top 8 plant 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.639
 I'm also done with this 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.260
 the cleaning of a new video is coming 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.479
 soon again in the sewer pipe in the 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.130
 channel purely yes what do you need 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.169
 Otherwise wash or what street 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.010
 Here are two more 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.380
 vacuum cleaner and then such a thing to 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.090
 knock down one of the 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.380
 foot mats 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.849
 I really hope to be home now 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.770
 Do not do that here now because I find 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.660
 Things are not so tingling now 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.030
 They are quite good here, too 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.169
 a decent suction also with 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.970
 here really a big nozzle and that 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.250
 is already alright now not so 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.370
 expensive the same price will cost you 50 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.919
 cent you can even wiessee 10 and 20 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.840
 cent insert yes it is all right 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.950
 but I would not prioritize now 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.360
 Of course you can do this here 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.720
 Of course, nothing speaks 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.070
 but otherwise that's really mine 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.490
 favorite wash street here in the area 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.550
 There are two others that have one 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.340
 of it had already seen in the video 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.590
 gladbach is very good, but there we go 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.880
 Too many chaotic rum and then it does 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.760
 video will turn for you then of course 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.550
 not so much fun so that was 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.070
 my video on this 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.230
 on the topic of what washing street should I 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.420
 use what do I have to pay attention etc 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.590
 if you like the video and golf 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.100
 I like to thumb up 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.150
 I am very happy and write to me 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.830
 but just in the comments 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.230
 how does your wash water from what 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.150
 Does that cost us too? Why go rather ? 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.730
 There you have an alternative of me 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.020
 to choose from so interested in me let 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.090
 have a little discussion and talk about it 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.660
 speak 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.660
 Until next time
