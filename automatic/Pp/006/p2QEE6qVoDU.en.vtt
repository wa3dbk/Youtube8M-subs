00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.980
 right pictures 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.260
 I followed the conference on youtube. 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 by the official samsung mobile channel and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 They said several things, right? 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.790
 come on, they said next 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.790
 faster processors better cameras 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 They talked about samsung ipi with master and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 visa and banks, right? 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 samsung with loading is 6 with 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.300
 charging wirelessly 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 the s6 edis with two curved edges né 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.780
 is the metal s6 it will be 50% more 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.350
 resistant than the competition type 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.600
 pin pointing the iphone and says that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 it's 6 will not fold let's see it will not have 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 a lot of people wanting to fold and the only one is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.840
 who's going to be crazy to leave, huh? 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.710
 there is also improvement is not in the interface 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.470
 with the user is personal, not everything is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.909
 in the same sequence as the interface with 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.240
 the right user or it will have the s6 ad 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.659
 he will have the edges that shone right 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 the processor is a single 64 bit of 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.939
 14 nanometer right lower consumption of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 battery 35% more savings and 30% more 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.170
 fast processor and it will use the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.119
 of r 4 and that 80% faster than 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 others that the other memories 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.549
 storage they said they 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.070
 made a merger between ssd and mmc 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.720
 to make it faster, do not 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.020
 the exchange of information between memories 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.850
 or the screen of 5 point one inch super 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.270
 2% amoled 77% more pixels compared 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.520
 to the previous generation loading 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.039
 fast from 10 minutes to four hours 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.030
 5-way front camera 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.420
 megapixels with less noise and ideal for 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.569
 self 16 megapixels 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.489
 with the aperture of f1 1.9 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.650
 you can see the area the comparison 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.940
 between the iphone 6 flat iphone i know if the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.060
 galaxy and 6 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.430
 the camera is very fast 07 seconds is 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.630
 To take a picture, you see it. 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.209
 in the images the west 6 and the s6 is of 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.690

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.180
 design and occupy if it is for you the a3 1 a 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.180
 5 already has a very nice design and is 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.150
 they simply completely renewed the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.890
 The design of the device does not 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.310
 the s5 they changed the edges really well 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.790
 curve along with my screen is body of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.600
 metal, there's no way to say that. 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.930
 no, it's not but it's very much like the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.079
 series a and the iphone 6 line very 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.019

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.900
 that no iphones no samsung s 59 are 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.090
 none is seems to have stagnated and stayed 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.790
 that one and that of that one 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.299
 But it seems that now she has succeeded. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.780
 give at least a broad and in performance 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.739
 on canvas comes with gorilla glass 4 protection 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.389

 memory 32 gb 64 and 128 gb of 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.330
 very good storage and are seeing 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.310
 around 80% faster with r 4 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.730
 when it basically uses 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.930
 the memory of do not 4 which is also a 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.760
