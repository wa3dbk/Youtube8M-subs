but without further ado I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.820> explain<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> entire<00:00:48.899> system

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ahead and explain how the entire system

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.709 
ahead and explain how the entire system
works<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.579> terms<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
works or in terms of that what you can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
works or in terms of that what you can
do<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.989> immediately<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> action<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
do to immediately get into the action so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
do to immediately get into the action so
you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:54.989> also<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> schematic<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you can actually also get a schematic I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.650 
you can actually also get a schematic I
believe<00:00:56.640> from<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.910> two<00:00:57.030> games<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> import

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
believe from down two games to import

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
believe from down two games to import
this<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:57.840> any<00:00:58.140> world<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.559> want<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this into any world you want so as you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
this into any world you want so as you
can<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.079> system<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> now

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
can see there is the system is now

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
can see there is the system is now
turned<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.520> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.699> turn<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> off<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
turned on if you want to turn it off you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
turned on if you want to turn it off you
just<00:01:03.420> press<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> red<00:01:04.170> clay<00:01:05.040> button<00:01:05.339> right

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
just press the red clay button right

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
just press the red clay button right
here<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.180> makes<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> bit<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> noise<00:01:06.750> there

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
here and it makes a bit of noise there

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
here and it makes a bit of noise there
but<00:01:07.290> yeah<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> fills<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.580> with

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but yeah it fills all these with

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
but yeah it fills all these with
redstone<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.210> sets<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:09.840> these<00:01:10.140> command

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
redstone which sets up all these command

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.230 
redstone which sets up all these command
blocks<00:01:10.500> let's<00:01:11.130> turn<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.640> you'll

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
blocks let's turn this back on you'll

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
blocks let's turn this back on you'll
notice<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> bat<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.650> you'll

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
notice right off the bat that you'll

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
notice right off the bat that you'll
start<00:01:14.070> seeing<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.760> bunch<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.240> pressure<00:01:15.570> plates

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
start seeing a bunch of pressure plates

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.630 
start seeing a bunch of pressure plates
being<00:01:16.110> spawned<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.189> need<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> turn

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
being spawned and I think I need to turn

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.219 
being spawned and I think I need to turn
my<00:01:17.790> particles<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> order<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
my particles on in order for that to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600 
my particles on in order for that to
look<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.650> better<00:01:19.799> yes<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
look a little bit better yes as you can

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.370 
look a little bit better yes as you can
see<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> ton<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> things<00:01:22.080> being

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
see there are a ton of things being

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.749 
see there are a ton of things being
spawned<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.460> actually

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
spawned right now these are actually

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
spawned right now these are actually
going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.060> experience<00:01:24.960> orbs<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> are

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
going to be experience orbs that are

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.230 
going to be experience orbs that are
being<00:01:25.590> spawned<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.130> random<00:01:26.549> locations<00:01:26.580> which

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
being spawned in random locations which

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.660 
being spawned in random locations which
are<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.689> setting<00:01:28.020> off<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> pressure

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
are what are setting off the pressure

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.030 
are what are setting off the pressure
pads<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> determines<00:01:31.829> where<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
pads and that is determines where the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
pads and that is determines where the
explosions<00:01:32.790> come<00:01:33.000> from<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> tornado<00:01:33.750> but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
explosions come from and the tornado but

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.090 
explosions come from and the tornado but
let's<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.290> ahead<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> tornado

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
let's go ahead and get the tornado

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620 
let's go ahead and get the tornado
itself<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> press<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> diamond<00:01:36.479> block

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450 
itself when you press the diamond block
right<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.799> get<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.189> spawn

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
right over here you get your spawn

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
right over here you get your spawn
tornado<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.210> delete<00:01:39.479> tornado<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
tornado and your delete tornado and it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.520 
tornado and your delete tornado and it
is<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.920> simple<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.780> once<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is as simple as you think it is once you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.639 
is as simple as you think it is once you
place<00:01:43.829> let's<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.820> rid<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.090> cows

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
place let's get rid of these cows

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.429 
place let's get rid of these cows
alright<00:01:46.649> let's<00:01:46.950> place<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.340> down<00:01:48.259> all<00:01:49.259> right

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
alright let's place this down all right

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
alright let's place this down all right
at<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> tornado<00:01:50.159> spawns<00:01:50.579> immediately<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
at the tornado spawns immediately and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.580 
at the tornado spawns immediately and
the<00:01:51.630> cows<00:01:52.009> know<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> cows<00:01:54.470> what<00:01:55.470> am<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the cows know at the cows what am I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.940 
the cows know at the cows what am I
supposed<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> eat<00:01:56.159> oh<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:57.360> gosh<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.350> just

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
supposed to eat oh my gosh it is just

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.360 
supposed to eat oh my gosh it is just
going<00:01:59.340> insane

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
going insane

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.000 
going insane
right<00:02:00.460> now<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.510> tornadoes<00:02:02.080> are<00:02:02.410> actually

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
right now so the tornadoes are actually

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.430 
right now so the tornadoes are actually
being<00:02:03.580> controlled<00:02:03.970> by<00:02:04.060> an<00:02:04.270> invisible<00:02:04.540> gas<00:02:05.020> and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
being controlled by an invisible gas and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.530 
being controlled by an invisible gas and
that<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.860> direction<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.210> tornado

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
that is the direction that the tornado

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.969 
that is the direction that the tornado
goes<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.930> kind<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.170> controlled<00:02:08.530> by<00:02:08.680> wherever

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
goes it's kind of controlled by wherever

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.320 
goes it's kind of controlled by wherever
this<00:02:09.070> gas<00:02:09.310> goes<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:09.760> completely<00:02:10.150> random

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
this gas goes so it's completely random

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330 
this gas goes so it's completely random
and<00:02:10.720> what<00:02:11.200> you'll<00:02:11.350> notice<00:02:11.380> right<00:02:11.830> off<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.160> bat

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and what you'll notice right off the bat

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.870 
and what you'll notice right off the bat
as<00:02:12.550> well<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.720> taking<00:02:14.260> real<00:02:14.590> blocks<00:02:14.980> from

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
as well is it is taking real blocks from

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.790 
as well is it is taking real blocks from
the<00:02:16.090> map<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:16.570> just<00:02:16.930> spawning<00:02:17.320> invisible

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
the map it's not just spawning invisible

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.260 
the map it's not just spawning invisible
blocks<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.340> taking<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> blocks<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
blocks it is taking the blocks and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.570 
blocks it is taking the blocks and
actually<00:02:20.020> distributing<00:02:20.560> them<00:02:20.710> all<00:02:20.890> over<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
actually distributing them all over the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
actually distributing them all over the
map<00:02:21.760> area<00:02:22.030> now<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.720> course<00:02:22.870> if<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.230> want<00:02:23.470> to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
map area now of course if you want to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.640 
map area now of course if you want to
turn<00:02:23.950> off<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:25.090> tornado<00:02:25.510> there<00:02:26.050> are<00:02:26.230> one<00:02:26.500> of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
turn off the tornado there are one of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.350 
turn off the tornado there are one of
two<00:02:26.830> ways<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.370> will<00:02:27.520> happen<00:02:27.700> oh<00:02:27.970> my<00:02:28.120> gosh

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
two ways that will happen oh my gosh

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.820 
two ways that will happen oh my gosh
it's<00:02:28.600> lagged<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.080> little<00:02:29.290> bit<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.710> turn

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
it's lagged a little bit I got to turn

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.950 
it's lagged a little bit I got to turn
this<00:02:29.980> off<00:02:30.220> let<00:02:30.670> me<00:02:30.730> turn<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.970> off<00:02:31.060> right<00:02:31.210> now<00:02:31.270> it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
this off let me turn it off right now it

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.540 
this off let me turn it off right now it
should<00:02:32.110> be<00:02:32.260> turned<00:02:32.380> off<00:02:32.650> wow<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.160> see<00:02:33.370> these

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
should be turned off wow you see these

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.920 
should be turned off wow you see these
blocks<00:02:33.820> still<00:02:34.060> explode<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:34.510> crazy

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
blocks still explode that's crazy

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.170 
blocks still explode that's crazy
alright<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:36.250> are<00:02:36.370> two<00:02:36.490> ways<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.910> turn<00:02:37.060> it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
alright so there are two ways to turn it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.910 
alright so there are two ways to turn it
off<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.450> either<00:02:37.630> by<00:02:37.810> doing<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.320> clicking

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
off it's either by doing that clicking

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.650 
off it's either by doing that clicking
delete<00:02:39.070> tornado<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.760> spawn<00:02:40.000> egg<00:02:40.180> or<00:02:40.330> if

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
delete tornado with the spawn egg or if

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.260 
delete tornado with the spawn egg or if
it<00:02:40.810> happens<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.320> run<00:02:41.560> into<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> hill<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:42.670> any

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
it happens to run into a hill of any

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.450 
it happens to run into a hill of any
sort<00:02:43.690> I'm<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.020> an<00:02:44.140> effect<00:02:44.410> at<00:02:44.560> daytime<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.310> it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
sort I'm just an effect at daytime if it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.820 
sort I'm just an effect at daytime if it
runs<00:02:45.610> into<00:02:45.820> any<00:02:46.030> kind<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.540> Hill<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.440> also

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
runs into any kind of Hill it is also

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.290 
runs into any kind of Hill it is also
prone<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.100> explosion<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.760> way<00:02:48.910> there<00:02:49.120> are

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
prone to explosion that way there are

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.230 
prone to explosion that way there are
still<00:02:49.870> blocks<00:02:50.740> coming<00:02:51.190> down<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.640> oh<00:02:51.760> my<00:02:52.030> gosh

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.690 
still blocks coming down and oh my gosh
she's<00:02:52.540> freezing<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:53.050> now<00:02:53.110> oh<00:02:53.440> my<00:02:54.370> gosh<00:02:54.550> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
she's freezing right now oh my gosh the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.170 
she's freezing right now oh my gosh the
destruction<00:02:55.210> ooh<00:02:55.330> ooh<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.740> have<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> target<00:02:57.700> yes

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
destruction ooh ooh I have a target yes

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.800 
destruction ooh ooh I have a target yes
I<00:02:58.480> do

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
I do

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.200

oh my goodness okay yes but yes so the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.880 
oh my goodness okay yes but yes so the
tornado<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:02.080> controlled<00:03:02.470> by<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.620> invisible

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
tornado is controlled by the invisible

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.340 
tornado is controlled by the invisible
gas<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:04.270> can<00:03:04.390> actually<00:03:04.510> set<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.989> if<00:03:05.170> you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
gas and you can actually set that if you

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.900 
gas and you can actually set that if you
are<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> little<00:03:05.709> more<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> whiz<00:03:06.190> at<00:03:06.489> redstone

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
are a little more of a whiz at redstone

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.490 
are a little more of a whiz at redstone
than<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.209> am<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.570> some<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.110> command<00:03:08.320> block

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
than I am in some of the command block

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.900 
than I am in some of the command block
settings<00:03:08.800> over<00:03:09.040> there<00:03:09.190> but<00:03:09.400> otherwise<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.880> is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
settings over there but otherwise it is

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.130 
settings over there but otherwise it is
just<00:03:10.000> controlled<00:03:10.450> by<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.660> Gast

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
just controlled by the Gast

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.229 
just controlled by the Gast
and<00:03:11.260> again<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> experience<00:03:12.310> orbs<00:03:12.850> are<00:03:13.000> what

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
