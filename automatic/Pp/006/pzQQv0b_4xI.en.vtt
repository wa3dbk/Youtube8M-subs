00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.309
 and that's the talk guys there was also 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.679
 come to another video on iotti channel 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.200
 gamers today to show you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 a new update of the man team fortress 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 versus machine 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.410
 the new game mode that came out there that the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.020
 you and five more cooperative 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.500
 friends will face an order of robots 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.410
 and with that protect the team store 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.199
 fortress a doctor or and against the robots 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.880
 trying to plant a bomb in it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.620
 this background conversation that you are 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.050
 listening there is because I was playing with 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.450
 friends in the positions between button and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.450
 I took advantage of the first match 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 that I played this way and that I have 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.629
 that talking to you was very difficult 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
 to be able to play saw because the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.870
 This server seems to be very 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.059
 full and the business you found broken 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.649
 automatically there the coldplay is not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.449
 running right 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.859
 so I just had to create my own 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 own server here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.879
 I called my friends and we started 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 play with 34 is know that you are seeing 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.150
 the first round of the map if you connect the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.860
 third map and several are coming 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 various rev robots 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.240
 you can see that in this game mode 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.360
 all robots are variations of the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.890
 classes that exist will come with 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 glove is snippers with bow and arrow bar 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.750
 various types of classes brother 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 also giants in some laws 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.500
 the laws are every round nor of robots that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:41.579
 Come on, you can see I'm struggling there to see if 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 can hold the robots and that's where 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.590
 you saw down a bomb this 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.560
 bomb they try to put it in the store 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.119
 goal is to not let them 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.130
 put the bomb then you have to 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.290
 kill who is carrying and whenever 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.040
 the pump had always dropped the pump in the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.899
 floor 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.950
 another robot will go there and try to catch 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:05.100
 nenÃª managed to pass the first eiv 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 complete with robots money 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.349
 you can buy nets is a good business 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.020
 different in team fortress, and you? 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.730
 can buy for example more ammunition 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.650
 the gold you can buy type 1a 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.250
 insisted that when you shoot 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 You make a living and I know I'm done. 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.410
 to equip is a canteen that is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.350
 available to you can capture or 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.200
 find it also this little corner you can 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.400
 at the beginning of each round between each eiv 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.820
 You can fill it up with some muffins. 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 can put for example critical or amb 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.220
 or ammunition and then you equip in six 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.010
 Lots are already that those logic that stays 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.410
 for example high five striker 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.330
 those Christmas effects and as in the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.570
 In the middle of the game you press h to activate 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.240
 the effect of it is quite useful there because 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.190
 you can for example the rev kabul 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.950
 ammunition you could with the full field 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.540
 and activate it and you will see the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.540
 instant ammunition 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:17.510
 the team is composed of a moment I of 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:21.740
 heavy and another that looks like 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.630
 got through easily 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.580
 I took a doctor ahmed it 's always 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.490
 important but in this game in this mode of 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.670
 game is a little bit complicated to see if the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.100
 doctor will miss you so much because 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.959
 you really need firepower the doctor 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.290
 he will always be giving support 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:46.980
 but it will not help as much is killing the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:49.740
 Blue October efe fun we were 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.950
 waiting to start the next whole bill 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.790
 world boots there in the ready 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.740
 In total there are six oases on this map. 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.150
 I think the other others are seven or 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.000
 eight do not have major certainty underneath 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.880
 of what ladies show shows 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.660
 next ministers who saw 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.060
 we passed robots can come there giant 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.470
 sun this year in the criticism can 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.980
 main 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.190
 the space is very interesting that it does not 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.810
 I control spy so stole it but he 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.100
 Kill yourself, my God, you have to drink a lot. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.960
 be careful with him 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.210
 he has more as support do not see 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.180
 large quantities is the same as other 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.900
 the other robots but for him also comes 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.090
 makes a damage our DNA there already 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.210
 put them in the top of the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.550
 prepare the robots and always it is very 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.920
 great help in this way of july she 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.320
 really gets in the way of robots 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.110
 to advance but only have to take much 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.050
 watch out for the robot robot has a robot that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.970
 is the center in search of it 's kind a 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.040
 pump with modern 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.990
 There he comes, you have to try. 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.420
 explode as fast as possible because 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.730
 he always runs behind the centers 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.540
 I ended up dying for the giant there. 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.690
 Because it gave a lot of time is important. 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.370
 buy and also have great 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.610
 resistance you exist more to bullets 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.100
 magmatic breach has several 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.710
 things and then you can motivate me 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.480
 critic's corner and finished the 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.790
 Giant with my friend. 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.000
 Can you see me, the singer makes a 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.380
 great difference and converting yet another 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.490
 Web radio 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:40.020
 let's go next and the other the wave already 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.270
 complicated a little bit because it comes 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.830
 a tank that tank if he gets there 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.350
 in the end he already has a bomb inside 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.750
 then if he arrives at the base he 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.820
 explode and lose the game 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.050
 it has a very great resistance 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.090
 also 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.150
 besides the tank 's robot still come 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.770
 some robots to disrupt the life of 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.170
 a great firepower to take down 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.000
 he fast before he arrives and has 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.440
 to take care of others not to 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.160
 distracting you while the other robots 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.160
 take a bomb and take it to a gang 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.370
 the tank of a job and intends to 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.400
 destroy but we managed to 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.810
 almost lost us and I 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.760
 I'll go ahead and I will not put a video 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.120
 everything to not get too big but in the 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.890
 Last there was the last tank he finished. 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.380
 winning it seems that the game is well at 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.110
 messed up in booth terms and the tank 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.640
 He stopped at the edge and threw the bomb but the 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.030
 people do not lose the pace continues 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:54.840
 destroying a tank and gained in addition 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.490
 the state hotel connected but it was always 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.310
 It was pretty funny that the tank for the 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.100
 play abdomen and keep throwing go 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.370
 able to complete the mission there and 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.840
 finish the map quentin is it there 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.390
 personal video stays here if you 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.490
 Did you not forget to leave him there and I? 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.890
 I really like please, favoritism and 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.030
 this helps a lot and until the next 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.030
 video a hug
