00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.089
 hello here is a small video of opportunity and the artists 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 why this week on compensation from images 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.809
 in three of the 25 m was missing in Polynesia table 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.380
 at first we go on the agreement deals with a plane an image 

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:20.339
 precisely in this same axis as the simplest function 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.429
 so it's just w to switch to full screen 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.629
 of creysse plants roughly to the proportions of our image 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.990
 right now this plan once created I will at sea the name of this segment 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 to squeeze the world my game plan and not their modeling 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.920
 future 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 but we hold back there I created in a border view automatically 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.120
 so we see directly online and in the present the posted 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.220
 the faces simply 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.750
 so the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840
 here is my folder with my picture 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.040
 that I am directly aiming 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.340
 surmounting 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 automatically is reported 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.050
 in the seine I'm going well clicked in my social plan have joined that the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.920
 opportunity to put in the background but not to be wrong he has 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 existed after creating a father 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.619
 once we've done that our fish we can see it a little bit distorted 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.450
 in relation to the size of our plan so quite 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.830
 to change the appearance we can see a picture simply this winter by 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.050
 ratio to the surface of the coronal plane adjusts 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.580
 compared to my plan 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.470
 so at that time 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.020
 they selected 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.370
 I will go to the menu as modified 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 look for the modifier by holding the winged 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.990
 then vw batigne that you will not see because it's just below the cei 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.600
 a morning vw 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.010
 that one 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.170
 in my list of hundred outside the capture field 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 in the museum all the mac we'll just 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.760
 adjusted 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.750
 compared to paws an image so I take 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 previously adjusted the image 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 and india according to her fell 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.870
 simply third axis folder 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.069
 boujean the picture 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.689
 hold him back 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.219
 and we can see if I come back on my side 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.829
 automatically shortly we removed loops not interested too much 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.559
 the modifier is active this button allows to see the result of soloists 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.899
 active cursed outer chorus in the stack 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.899
 report on the spot as well as the good plan to put for example 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.239
 why what we see here the landmark that will allow 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.299
 when I will be in perspective to understand where will be the foremost 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.469
 simply 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.219
 two big fish they spent the first part 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.489
 for the set 6-0 the configuration of the scene for modeling a loan 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.189
 a picture
