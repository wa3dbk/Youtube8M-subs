Tokyo and watch video the whole way on

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.710 
Tokyo and watch video the whole way on
one<00:02:20.849> charge<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:22.080> pretty<00:02:22.290> nice

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
one charge it's pretty nice

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.740 
one charge it's pretty nice
and<00:02:25.520> in<00:02:26.520> addition<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:26.940> 10<00:02:27.120> hours<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.480> battery

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and in addition to 10 hours of battery

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.070 
and in addition to 10 hours of battery
life<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:29.040> has<00:02:29.160> over<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> month<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.150> standby<00:02:30.750> life

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
life it has over a month of standby life

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.619 
life it has over a month of standby life
so<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.069> could<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.250> set<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.849> iPad<00:02:33.239> down<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
so we could just set the iPad down it

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.059 
so we could just set the iPad down it
would<00:02:33.720> go<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> sleep<00:02:34.200> automatically<00:02:34.769> we<00:02:34.860> come

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
would go to sleep automatically we come

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.110 
would go to sleep automatically we come
back<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.400> month<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.790> still<00:02:36.000> have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
back in a month it would still have

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.880 
back in a month it would still have
charge<00:02:36.980> it's<00:02:37.980> remarkable

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
charge it's remarkable
