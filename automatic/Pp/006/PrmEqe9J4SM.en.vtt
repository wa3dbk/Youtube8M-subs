starter e99 here's a trick they use they
use<00:02:11.799> this<00:02:12.069> little<00:02:12.370> fiber<00:02:12.610> pot<00:02:13.470> 6-inch<00:02:14.470> fiber

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
use this little fiber pot 6-inch fiber

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.039 
use this little fiber pot 6-inch fiber
pot<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.980> grow<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.640> Calla<00:02:15.940> about<00:02:16.690> eight<00:02:16.870> weeks

like that
Japanese<00:02:29.769> huh<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.360> came<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
Japanese huh here this actually came I

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.539 
Japanese huh here this actually came I
took<00:02:31.870> from<00:02:32.049> from<00:02:32.530> Europe<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.190> idea<00:02:33.489> in

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
took from from Europe this idea in

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.780 
took from from Europe this idea in
Europe<00:02:33.819> that's<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.489> sometimes<00:02:36.489> you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
Europe that's right so sometimes you

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.670 
Europe that's right so sometimes you
want<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.209> know<00:02:37.329> I<00:02:37.480> guess<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.900> European

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
want to you know I guess the European

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.000 
want to you know I guess the European
trend<00:02:39.280> now<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.790> smaller<00:02:40.660> pots<00:02:41.319> which<00:02:41.739> also

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
trend now is smaller pots which also

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.410 
trend now is smaller pots which also
needs<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.250> smaller<00:02:42.489> price<00:02:42.730> point<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.180> don't

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
needs a smaller price point but don't

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.390 
needs a smaller price point but don't

cool<00:03:00.790> same<00:03:01.239> kind<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.540> concept<00:03:01.750> only<00:03:02.170> smaller

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
cool same kind of concept only smaller

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.319 
cool same kind of concept only smaller
and<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.609> one<00:03:03.730> from<00:03:03.910> Japan

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
pot that's also challenging because the

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.699 
pot that's also challenging because the
colors<00:03:09.760> often<00:03:09.970> perform<00:03:10.450> differently<00:03:10.870> so
