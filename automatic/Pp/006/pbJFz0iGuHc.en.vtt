greens<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.720> start<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.020> mix<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
greens will kind of start to mix up in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.160 
greens will kind of start to mix up in
there<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.780> let<00:01:42.960> this

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
there as we go and I like to let this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
there as we go and I like to let this
portion<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.950> blend<00:01:44.340> probably<00:01:44.970> maybe<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
portion of a blend probably maybe for a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
portion of a blend probably maybe for a
minute<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.700> want

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
minute or so just because I don't want

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
minute or so just because I don't want
chunks<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> spinach<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.110> collard<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.860> chunks

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
chunks of spinach or collard or chunks

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.620 
chunks of spinach or collard or chunks
of<00:01:50.340> broccoli<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> smoothie<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
of broccoli and the smoothie and the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.940 
of broccoli and the smoothie and the
kids<00:01:51.869> probably<00:01:52.110> wouldn't<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.710> much

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
kids probably wouldn't like that much

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.980 
kids probably wouldn't like that much
either<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> blend<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.720> real

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
either so I like to blend this up real

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560 
either so I like to blend this up real
good<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> gets<00:01:55.649> liquefied<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
good so it gets liquefied all right so

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:21.240 
good so it gets liquefied all right so
here<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.619> go

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:39.600 

liquefied<00:02:22.250> real<00:02:22.519> well

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:03:01.870 

alone

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.839 

well

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:24.770 

big<00:03:09.849> chunky

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.800 

so<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.230> know<00:03:25.410> we<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.650> start<00:03:25.920> adding<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.430> crew

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
so you know we can start adding my crew

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.510 
so you know we can start adding my crew
I'll<00:03:27.810> put<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.170> banana<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.709> there<00:03:28.860> first<00:03:31.520> how's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
I'll put the banana in there first how's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.370 
I'll put the banana in there first how's
it<00:03:32.700> going<00:03:33.000> mad<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.480> which<00:03:33.600> will<00:03:33.840> be<00:03:33.990> put<00:03:34.260> in

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
it going mad and which will be put in

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.800 
it going mad and which will be put in

kind of vacancies head back down i
always<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.630> add<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.740> blade

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.559 

let<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.110> ended<00:03:54.470> up<00:03:54.620> here<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:54.860> little<00:03:55.040> bit

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.360 

the<00:04:01.569> job

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:21.890 

Oh<00:04:07.580> Samantha<00:04:08.580> women<00:04:09.090> now

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:43.780 

yes

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.820 

a<00:04:43.880> little<00:04:44.780> bit<00:04:44.900> of<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.110> system<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.710> you

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
a little bit of a system that you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.770 
a little bit of a system that you
probably<00:04:46.100> use<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.400> little<00:04:46.550> bit<00:04:46.910> more<00:04:47.120> water<00:04:47.420> in

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
probably use a little bit more water in

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.690 
probably use a little bit more water in
here<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.140> consistencies<00:04:48.980> probably<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.610> a

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
here the consistencies probably just a

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.980 
here the consistencies probably just a
little<00:04:49.880> bit<00:04:50.150> too<00:04:50.330> thick<00:04:50.630> still<00:04:52.750> another<00:04:53.750> to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
little bit too thick still another to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.900 
little bit too thick still another to
our<00:04:54.110> Moon<00:04:54.320> River<00:04:54.500> water<00:04:55.010> dirty<00:04:59.530> their<00:05:00.530> mush

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
our Moon River water dirty their mush

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.280 
our Moon River water dirty their mush
it's<00:05:01.910> already<00:05:02.210> plenty

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:22.760 

a<00:05:10.770> little<00:05:11.770> bit<00:05:11.889> more

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.500 

now<00:05:23.770> that's<00:05:24.040> good<00:05:24.280> right<00:05:24.520> there<00:05:24.790> now<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.150> can

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
now that's good right there now you can

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.810 
now that's good right there now you can
see<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:25.780> consistencies<00:05:26.620> pretty<00:05:27.100> thick<00:05:27.460> still

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
see the consistencies pretty thick still

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.880 
see the consistencies pretty thick still
and<00:05:28.060> that's<00:05:28.360> actually<00:05:28.630> okay<00:05:29.230> with<00:05:29.260> me<00:05:29.650> this

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
and that's actually okay with me this

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.330 
and that's actually okay with me this
this<00:05:30.160> part<00:05:30.460> right<00:05:30.520> here<00:05:30.700> is<00:05:31.030> for<00:05:31.270> me<00:05:32.100> so<00:05:33.100> I'll

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
this part right here is for me so I'll

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.670 
this part right here is for me so I'll
probably<00:05:33.550> take<00:05:33.880> about<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.720> don't<00:05:35.380> know<00:05:35.470> it's

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
probably take about I don't know it's

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.800 
probably take about I don't know it's
probably<00:05:35.860> Bob<00:05:36.190> probably<00:05:37.150> about<00:05:37.270> four<00:05:37.570> cups

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
probably Bob probably about four cups

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.420 
probably Bob probably about four cups
right<00:05:38.110> there<00:05:38.290> that<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.770> took<00:05:38.950> now<00:05:39.220> that's

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
right there that I just took now that's

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.190 
right there that I just took now that's
going<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.670> leave<00:05:39.880> about<00:05:40.150> another<00:05:40.480> cup<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.140> a

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
going to leave about another cup and a

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.160 
going to leave about another cup and a
half<00:05:41.230> maybe<00:05:41.710> two<00:05:42.070> cups<00:05:42.370> here<00:05:42.670> of<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.930> blend

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
half maybe two cups here of the blend

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.050 
half maybe two cups here of the blend
that<00:05:44.320> we<00:05:44.500> just<00:05:44.770> made<00:05:44.980> now<00:05:45.250> because<00:05:45.700> it's<00:05:45.850> for

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
that we just made now because it's for

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.320 
that we just made now because it's for
the<00:05:46.150> kids<00:05:46.390> you<00:05:47.200> can<00:05:47.350> see<00:05:47.560> it's<00:05:47.710> green<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.330> most

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
the kids you can see it's green so most

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.510 
the kids you can see it's green so most
kids<00:05:49.690> will<00:05:50.500> look<00:05:50.680> at<00:05:50.860> something<00:05:51.070> like<00:05:51.250> this

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
kids will look at something like this

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.890 
kids will look at something like this
and<00:05:51.760> probably<00:05:51.910> think<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:52.420> not<00:05:52.570> very<00:05:52.780> good

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
and probably think it's not very good

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.660 
and probably think it's not very good
just<00:05:53.320> based<00:05:53.560> on<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.800> fact<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.220> it's<00:05:54.430> green

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
just based on the fact that it's green

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.070 
just based on the fact that it's green
before<00:05:54.910> they<00:05:55.210> even<00:05:55.300> try<00:05:55.630> it<00:05:55.660> they<00:05:55.870> probably

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
before they even try it they probably

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.990 
before they even try it they probably
won't<00:05:56.290> even<00:05:56.440> won't<00:05:56.950> even<00:05:57.070> be<00:05:57.400> interested<00:05:57.580> in

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
won't even won't even be interested in

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.690 
won't even won't even be interested in
at<00:05:58.210> all<00:05:58.390> so<00:05:59.080> what<00:05:59.650> I<00:05:59.680> like<00:05:59.890> to<00:06:00.010> do<00:06:00.130> now<00:06:00.160> is<00:06:00.370> I'll

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
at all so what I like to do now is I'll

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.400 
at all so what I like to do now is I'll
just<00:06:00.820> put<00:06:01.030> some<00:06:01.210> frozen<00:06:01.510> berries<00:06:02.050> in<00:06:02.230> there

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
just put some frozen berries in there
