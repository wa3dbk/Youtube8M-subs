these new beauties from the Iowa are

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.980 
these new beauties from the Iowa are
basically<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.490> same<00:00:16.520> reel<00:00:17.029> as<00:00:17.240> their<00:00:17.420> Psaltis

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.100 
basically the same reel as their Psaltis
I<00:00:18.199> guess<00:00:18.320> now<00:00:18.470> it's<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:18.740> BG<00:00:19.160> version<00:00:20.020> but<00:00:21.020> they

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
I guess now it's the BG version but they

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.650 
I guess now it's the BG version but they
have<00:00:21.290> one<00:00:21.590> less<00:00:21.830> ball<00:00:22.130> bearing<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.240> biggest

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
have one less ball bearing the biggest

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.880 
have one less ball bearing the biggest
difference<00:00:23.960> in<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.170> two<00:00:24.320> is<00:00:24.530> that<00:00:24.710> these

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
difference in the two is that these

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.460 
difference in the two is that these
actually<00:00:25.280> have<00:00:25.310> graphite<00:00:26.000> bodies<00:00:26.420> as<00:00:26.630> opposed

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
actually have graphite bodies as opposed
