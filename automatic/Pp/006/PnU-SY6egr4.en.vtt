a<00:00:33.980> thousand<00:00:34.910> dollars<00:00:35.500> but<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:36.620> found<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:37.070> smoke

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
a thousand dollars but I found a smoke

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.670 
a thousand dollars but I found a smoke
machine<00:00:37.489> by<00:00:37.940> custom<00:00:38.480> smoke<00:00:38.780> that<00:00:39.260> costs<00:00:39.620> just

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
machine by custom smoke that costs just

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.520 
machine by custom smoke that costs just
a<00:00:39.949> little<00:00:40.220> over<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.550> hundred<00:00:40.640> dollars<00:00:41.530> and

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
a little over a hundred dollars and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.380 
a little over a hundred dollars and
that's<00:00:42.710> why<00:00:42.920> my<00:00:43.100> thousand<00:00:43.640> dollar<00:00:43.820> machine<00:00:44.269> is

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
that's why my thousand dollar machine is

and the negative cable to the battery to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.320 
and the negative cable to the battery to
generate<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.260> smoke<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.790> smoke<00:01:32.030> comes

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
generate the smoke and the smoke comes

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.180 
generate the smoke and the smoke comes
out<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.690> other<00:01:32.810> end<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.440> can<00:01:33.620> stick<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.100> in

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
out the other end so you can stick it in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.980 
out the other end so you can stick it in
place<00:01:34.430> us<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:35.060> see<00:01:35.240> where<00:01:35.390> there's<00:01:35.540> leak<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
place us to see where there's leak the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.240 
place us to see where there's leak the
smoke<00:01:36.260> will<00:01:36.410> come<00:01:36.530> out<00:01:36.680> where<00:01:36.920> stuff<00:01:37.130> is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
smoke will come out where stuff is

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.230 
smoke will come out where stuff is
leaking<00:01:38.500> nah<00:01:39.500> no<00:01:39.680> mechanic<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:40.760> I<00:01:40.790> use<00:01:41.090> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
leaking nah no mechanic so I use the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.000 
leaking nah no mechanic so I use the
pressure<00:01:41.480> regulator<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.410> comes<00:01:42.620> with<00:01:42.860> hook

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
pressure regulator that comes with hook

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.100 
pressure regulator that comes with hook
it<00:01:43.130> up<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.370> my<00:01:43.400> air<00:01:43.700> supply<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.780> pumps

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
it up to my air supply and that pumps

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.840 
it up to my air supply and that pumps
the<00:01:45.320> air<00:01:45.350> through<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:45.980> you<00:01:46.340> could<00:01:46.520> take<00:01:46.700> it

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
the air through but you could take it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.490 
the air through but you could take it
off<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:47.360> blowing<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.930> with<00:01:48.050> your<00:01:48.260> mouth

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
off and just blowing it with your mouth

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.530 
off and just blowing it with your mouth
to<00:01:48.860> push<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.100> smoke<00:01:49.490> through<00:01:49.760> or<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.300> can<00:01:50.360> get

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
to push the smoke through or you can get

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.960 
to push the smoke through or you can get
a<00:01:50.570> bicycle<00:01:50.990> pump<00:01:51.260> and<00:01:51.710> use<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> bicycle<00:01:52.159> pump<00:01:52.550> to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
a bicycle pump and use a bicycle pump to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.550 
a bicycle pump and use a bicycle pump to
pump<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.360> air<00:01:53.390> through<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.810> system<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.440> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
pump the air through the system so the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.230 
pump the air through the system so the
smoke<00:01:54.860> will<00:01:55.040> show<00:01:55.159> where<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.400> leaks<00:01:55.610> are<00:01:55.850> you

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
smoke will show where the leaks are you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.140 
smoke will show where the leaks are you
don't<00:01:56.420> have<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.990> an<00:01:57.380> air<00:01:57.650> compressor<00:01:58.150> now

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
don't have to have an air compressor now

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.910 
don't have to have an air compressor now
let's<00:01:59.330> say<00:01:59.420> your<00:01:59.540> vehicles<00:01:59.930> running<00:02:00.290> lean<00:02:00.470> you

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
let's say your vehicles running lean you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.620 
let's say your vehicles running lean you
can<00:02:01.010> go<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.280> brake<00:02:01.490> booster<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.479> can

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
can go to the brake booster and you can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.899 
can go to the brake booster and you can
take<00:02:02.810> off<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:02.990> hose<00:02:03.290> there<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.729> then<00:02:04.880> just

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
take off the hose there and then just

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.960 
take off the hose there and then just
inject<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.630> smoke<00:02:05.900> inside<00:02:06.140> there<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:07.729> check

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
inject the smoke inside there it check

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.690 
inject the smoke inside there it check
with<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> smoke<00:02:08.479> coming<00:02:08.869> up<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.259> in<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.619> case

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
with a smoke coming up and in this case

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
with a smoke coming up and in this case
it's<00:02:10.700> way<00:02:10.879> down<00:02:11.090> here<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:12.019> mass<00:02:12.230> airflow

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's way down here the mass airflow

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.729 
it's way down here the mass airflow
sensor<00:02:13.159> is<00:02:13.190> leaking<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.909> needs<00:02:14.180> replacing

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
sensor is leaking so it needs replacing

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.020 
sensor is leaking so it needs replacing
talked<00:02:15.739> about<00:02:15.980> quick<00:02:16.220> way<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.459> find<00:02:16.760> something

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
talked about quick way to find something

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.800 
talked about quick way to find something
that's<00:02:17.269> wrong

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
that's wrong

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.140 
that's wrong
no<00:02:18.739> shot<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.159> saw<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> mechanics<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
no shot I saw the mechanics and the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.820 
no shot I saw the mechanics and the
first<00:02:20.360> thing<00:02:20.569> some<00:02:20.750> guy<00:02:20.870> said<00:02:21.110> was<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
first thing some guy said was all that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.589 
first thing some guy said was all that
thing<00:02:21.980> looks<00:02:22.159> dangerous<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:22.640> really<00:02:23.180> it's

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
thing looks dangerous but really it's

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.210 
thing looks dangerous but really it's
got<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> fuse<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.379> it<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.680> you'd<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.069> worry

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
got a fuse on it so you'd have to worry

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.850 
got a fuse on it so you'd have to worry
about<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.519> wirings<00:02:25.909> going<00:02:26.150> bad<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.510> fused

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
about the wirings going bad it's fused

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.140 
about the wirings going bad it's fused
it's<00:02:27.860> got<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> pressure<00:02:28.340> regulator<00:02:28.730> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's got a pressure regulator that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.630 
it's got a pressure regulator that
regulates<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> pressure<00:02:29.900> -<00:02:30.230> like

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
regulates the pressure - like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.850 
regulates the pressure - like
half<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.790> PSI<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:31.990> doesn't<00:02:32.290> damage<00:02:32.470> anything

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
half a PSI so it doesn't damage anything

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.280 
half a PSI so it doesn't damage anything
by<00:02:33.160> blowing<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.610> smoke<00:02:33.730> too<00:02:34.030> fast<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.200> of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
by blowing the smoke too fast and of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.830 
by blowing the smoke too fast and of
course<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:36.250> has<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> very<00:02:36.730> basic<00:02:37.030> safety<00:02:37.630> valve

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
course it has a very basic safety valve

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.680 
course it has a very basic safety valve
the<00:02:38.830> top<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.280> paint<00:02:39.490> can<00:02:39.760> if<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.300> did<00:02:40.480> for

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the top of the paint can if it did for

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.150 
the top of the paint can if it did for
some<00:02:40.840> reason<00:02:41.200> build<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.560> too<00:02:41.709> much<00:02:41.860> pressure

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
some reason build up too much pressure

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.630 
some reason build up too much pressure
the<00:02:42.700> top<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.150> can<00:02:43.330> would<00:02:43.569> just<00:02:43.750> snap<00:02:43.959> off

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the top of the can would just snap off

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.770 
the top of the can would just snap off
but<00:02:45.640> I've<00:02:45.760> never<00:02:45.910> had<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.300> happen<00:02:46.330> because

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
but I've never had that happen because

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.630 
but I've never had that happen because
hey<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.500> smoke<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.950> coming<00:02:48.070> out<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.490> when

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
hey the smoke is coming out of here when

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.830 
hey the smoke is coming out of here when
the<00:02:48.700> pressures<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.180> gonna<00:02:49.420> come<00:02:49.600> out<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
the pressures just gonna come out of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.270 
the pressures just gonna come out of
this<00:02:49.959> hole<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.590> builds<00:02:50.860> up<00:02:50.950> too<00:02:51.130> much

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
this hole if it builds up too much

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.580 
this hole if it builds up too much
pressure<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.209> never<00:02:52.390> has<00:02:52.690> for<00:02:52.930> me<00:02:53.020> anyway

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
pressure and it never has for me anyway

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.470 
pressure and it never has for me anyway
now<00:02:54.160> as<00:02:54.340> with<00:02:54.520> any<00:02:54.670> smoke<00:02:55.030> machine<00:02:55.330> it's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
now as with any smoke machine it's

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.120 
now as with any smoke machine it's
supposed<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.840> use<00:02:55.959> them<00:02:56.110> outside<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.980> am

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
supposed to use them outside like I am

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.130 
supposed to use them outside like I am
in<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.340> driveway<00:02:57.610> because<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:58.630> you're<00:02:58.780> inside<00:02:59.110> a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
in a driveway because if you're inside a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.020 
in a driveway because if you're inside a
garage<00:02:59.350> that's<00:02:59.770> sealed<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.850> use<00:03:00.880> a

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
garage that's sealed up if you use a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.090 
garage that's sealed up if you use a
smoke<00:03:01.390> machine<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.319> say<00:03:02.530> working<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:02.950> an

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
smoke machine and you say working on an

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.430 
smoke machine and you say working on an
evap<00:03:03.430> system<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.000> has<00:03:04.150> gas<00:03:04.360> fumes<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.230> gas

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
evap system that has gas fumes the gas

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080 
evap system that has gas fumes the gas
fumes<00:03:05.680> could<00:03:05.950> get<00:03:06.130> blown<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.940> could

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
fumes could get blown up and you could

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.729 
fumes could get blown up and you could
cause<00:03:07.270> an<00:03:07.450> explosion<00:03:07.780> somewhere<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:08.470> if

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
cause an explosion somewhere but if

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.170 
cause an explosion somewhere but if
you're<00:03:08.920> working<00:03:09.190> outside<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.760> me<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.060> don't

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
you're working outside like me you don't

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.400 
you're working outside like me you don't
have<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.360> worry<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.110> would<00:03:11.260> just

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
have to worry about that they would just

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.280 
have to worry about that they would just
dissipate<00:03:11.920> into<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.250> air<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:13.930> use<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.200> to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
dissipate into the air you can use it to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.680 
dissipate into the air you can use it to
find<00:03:14.500> leaks<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.860> exhaust<00:03:15.220> systems<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.330> stick

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
find leaks in exhaust systems just stick

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.320 
find leaks in exhaust systems just stick
it<00:03:16.840> in<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.050> pipe<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.560> put<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> towel<00:03:18.610> there<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
it in the pipe and put a towel there and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.060 
it in the pipe and put a towel there and
wherever<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.870> leak<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.500> smoke<00:03:20.739> will<00:03:20.950> come

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
wherever the leak is the smoke will come

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.880 
wherever the leak is the smoke will come
out<00:03:21.450> heck<00:03:22.450> I've<00:03:22.630> even<00:03:22.959> used<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.410> find<00:03:23.590> leaks

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
out heck I've even used it to find leaks

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.740 
out heck I've even used it to find leaks
in<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.070> sewer<00:03:24.370> system<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:24.970> my<00:03:25.120> old<00:03:25.300> house<00:03:25.510> it's

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
in the sewer system of my old house it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.660 
in the sewer system of my old house it's
so<00:03:25.900> crooked<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.739> pipes<00:03:26.980> are<00:03:27.160> ice<00:03:27.250> breaking

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
so crooked the pipes are ice breaking

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.780 
so crooked the pipes are ice breaking
