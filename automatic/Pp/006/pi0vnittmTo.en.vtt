00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello everyone today we have a catch here 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.790
 such a great sized ra sensors and i 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.910
 I suggest to cook from them probably 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.940
 the most delicious dish is juicy ruddy 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.430
 rattan and and patties to your taste 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.440
 the qualities of these burgers are not inferior 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.400
 seekers or cutlets from herself 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.740
 maybe even surpasses them in some way 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.940
 so you should never shy away from 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.320
 this terrible black snout fish but 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.600
 you can always cook from it 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.839
 many delicious dishes including from 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.410
 they are burgers before cooking 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.179
 cutlets 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.879
 we need to clean the fish naturally 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.559
 if we have about tanchiki small 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.859
 size for example here are quite 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.989
 small you just enough them 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.239
 gut ie throw all 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.149
 entrails cut off fins and head 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.819
 and in principle . ready because 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.469
 turn her mince if mouth they 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:05.330
 big enough for example 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.030
 the desirability is not with them scales all the same 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.200
 the scales of it are large enough to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.950
 We did not score minced scales we shoot 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.469
 with this actually now we will start for 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.820
 this can be used fish cleaning 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:27.579
 Here is such a but it is easier to shoot 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:31.450
 With a knife, take a simple can anyone and 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.159
 remove created scales 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.600
 this is done very simply scales him 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.469
 sits very weakly not like a perch and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.930
 pike perch 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.929
 here everything is very clear here are a few 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.009
 movements and all the scales on the same listen and 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.679
 do it in the pelvis 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.250
 or under running water for example in 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.640
 the sink 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:02:02.460
 well we are doing it just on the table 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:05.979
 Now remove from the market all scales lift 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.840
 the light takes on a motion after 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.660
 how we removed the scales we will stay 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.240
 the main gut but this nasty 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.150
 procedures leave behind the scenes and move on 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.130
 immediately to the processing of carcasses gutted 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.870
 our ra tanchiki now we need them 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.170
 rinse and 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:31.739
 for this we fall asleep all of them sink 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.739
 open start 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.960
 now for everyone 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.920
 about Polotsk before sweeping I even life 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.920
 internal landing 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.910
 Well, here we are pleased to find clean brushes washed 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.480
 now we just have to get rid of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.620
 all the excess that is cut off the heads and 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.920
 fins that mince us to nothing 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.670
 therefore proceed to the separation of the set of southern 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.780
 parts if we need heads 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.310
 ear, respectively, we clean the gills and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.819
 it didn't make my head 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.860
 rotan needlessly I throw them away 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:40.480
 so just take a knife and an oblique cut 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:43.720
 cut off the head from the carcass remains here 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.160
 such a head and such a bird we take 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.780
 scissors and cut off accordingly 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.590
 fornicators 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.109
 which we also minced and why even with 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.560
 small fish is desirable logic, after all 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.560
 funds 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.900
 google 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.210
 there is such a finished carcass 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.010
 from big snout fish it turns out 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.190
 take a very small piece 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.860
 next 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.060
 and repeat the same thing so by 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.790
 short manipulations 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.030
 our pile of scary snatched bread 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.290
 turned into such a cute carcass of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.760
 which we can now produce 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:40.470
 minced also minced we will go onions 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.750
 onion and a little fat itself instant 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.120
 pork fat quite a bit since 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.880

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.680
 juicy also we need flour we 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.440
 add a little stuffing and we roll 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.810
 not cutlets and salt and pepper to taste 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.490
 You can also add some greens but 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.430
 no seasoning recommended 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.230
 second bro possesses his own enough 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.910
 bright taste and not to interrupt him 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.480
 we will not power what seasonings 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.990
 only pepper and parsley or dill 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.690
 to taste 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.820
 go to making stuffing for 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.670
 Convenience work carcasses large Antonov I 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.970
 cut into pieces also cut onions and 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.260
 cut across the world whose fat 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.960
 Now we go to the actual process 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.000
 scroll missed twice through 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.840
 minced meat grinder now we need to add

 flour and a little dill on a snowdrift 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.230
 frozen so add it in a dream 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.100
 and fresh until much better then stuffing 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.720
 need to knead and form patties 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.640
 lit the stove poured enough 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.920

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.240
 warmed up in the meantime can blind 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.740
 roll the patties in flour and now
