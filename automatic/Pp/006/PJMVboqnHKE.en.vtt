00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
gunfights and you'll see right now in
the<00:00:24.510> mini-map<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.380> they're<00:00:25.529> all<00:00:25.680> coming

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the mini-map that they're all coming

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.179 
the mini-map that they're all coming
back<00:00:26.189> towards<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> way<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> went<00:00:28.109> now<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
back towards the way that I went now the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.130 
back towards the way that I went now the
reason<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.640> all<00:00:29.730> died<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.300> because<00:00:30.750> they

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
reason they all died is because they

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.659 
reason they all died is because they
made<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:31.560> common<00:00:31.890> mistake<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.489> went

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
made a very common mistake and they went

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
made a very common mistake and they went
to<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> bunker<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> middle<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> map

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to the bunker or the middle of the map

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.209 
to the bunker or the middle of the map

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
both are situations that are not very

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.850 
both are situations that are not very
good<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.730> player<00:00:39.020> for<00:00:40.020> any<00:00:40.170> player<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> who

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
good for a player for any player and who

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
good for a player for any player and who
spawns<00:00:41.280> them<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.850> spawn<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.420> spawned<00:00:42.719> on

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
spawns them the spawn that we spawned on

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
spawns them the spawn that we spawned on
alright<00:00:43.770> how<00:00:43.950> many<00:00:44.100> times<00:00:44.309> did<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.700> say

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
alright how many times did I just say

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.330

cover<00:00:47.520> behind<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.000> rock<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.629> basically

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
cover behind that rock because basically

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
cover behind that rock because basically

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that snipers can't just you know hold

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780

their breath for five minutes and snipe
me<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.840> saying<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
me now I'm not saying that it's a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
me now I'm not saying that it's a
foolproof<00:01:23.159> plan<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> definitely<00:01:24.390> makes

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
foolproof plan but it definitely makes

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.320 
foolproof plan but it definitely makes
it<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.049> bit<00:01:25.259> harder<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.890> shot<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it a little bit harder to get shot so I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
it a little bit harder to get shot so I
kept<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.659> perimeter<00:01:27.900> missile<00:01:28.470> five<00:01:28.680> kill

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
kept my perimeter missile five kill

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.480 
kept my perimeter missile five kill
streak<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> unfortunately<00:01:30.420> no<00:01:30.840> dice<00:01:31.490> which

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
streak and unfortunately no dice which

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.319 
streak and unfortunately no dice which
obviously<00:01:34.280> really<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.490> embarrassing<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
obviously really really embarrassing to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.420

spawn that I can you know not that I

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.840 
spawn that I can you know not that I
have<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.870> worry<00:04:40.170> about<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.430> new<00:04:41.610> spawn

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
have to worry about but this new spawn

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.190 
have to worry about but this new spawn
is<00:04:42.000> actually<00:04:42.300> really<00:04:42.510> good<00:04:42.690> because<00:04:42.900> the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
is actually really good because the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.500 
is actually really good because the
spawning<00:04:43.470> near<00:04:43.800> me<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.220> got<00:04:45.030> some<00:04:45.210> really

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
spawning near me and I got some really

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.210 
spawning near me and I got some really
really<00:04:45.630> good<00:04:45.870> cover<00:04:46.140> behind<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.500> plane<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:47.190> I

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
really good cover behind the plane now I

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.590 
really good cover behind the plane now I
wouldn't<00:04:47.670> recommend<00:04:47.850> popping<00:04:48.300> out<00:04:48.420> by<00:04:48.540> the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
wouldn't recommend popping out by the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.300 
wouldn't recommend popping out by the
top<00:04:48.840> of<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.050> plane<00:04:49.260> cuz<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.710> kind<00:04:49.920> of<00:04:49.980> harder

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
top of the plane cuz it's kind of harder

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.520 
top of the plane cuz it's kind of harder
to<00:04:50.430> get<00:04:50.580> back<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.940> here<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.230> have<00:04:52.260> less

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
to get back in here and you have less

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.050 
to get back in here and you have less
cover<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:53.130> look<00:04:53.370> at<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.610> look<00:04:53.850> at<00:04:53.910> that

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
cover but look at that look at that

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.460 
cover but look at that look at that
cover<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.390> I'm<00:04:54.540> gonna<00:04:54.720> take<00:04:54.870> advantage<00:04:55.080> over

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
cover that I'm gonna take advantage over

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.560 
cover that I'm gonna take advantage over
and<00:04:55.890> over<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.190> over<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.520> look<00:04:56.670> like<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.360> think

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
and over and over it look like I think

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.420 
and over and over it look like I think
I've<00:04:57.690> gotten<00:04:57.900> like<00:04:58.020> four<00:04:58.320> already<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.980> this

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
I've gotten like four already and this

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.190 
I've gotten like four already and this
guy<00:04:59.640> had<00:04:59.820> painkiller<00:05:00.330> on<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.810> had<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.020> put

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
guy had painkiller on and I had to put

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.460 
guy had painkiller on and I had to put
like<00:05:01.350> six<00:05:01.920> full<00:05:02.400> bullets<00:05:03.000> into<00:05:03.270> his<00:05:03.450> chest<00:05:03.690> to

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
like six full bullets into his chest to

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.020 
like six full bullets into his chest to
take<00:05:04.650> him<00:05:04.800> out<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:04.980> was<00:05:05.220> still<00:05:05.430> able<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.730> do<00:05:05.880> it

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
take him out I was still able to do it

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.120 
take him out I was still able to do it
and<00:05:06.180> that's<00:05:06.300> just<00:05:06.680> well<00:05:07.680> I'm<00:05:07.740> not<00:05:07.860> I'm<00:05:08.100> not

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
and that's just well I'm not I'm not

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.710 
and that's just well I'm not I'm not
gonna<00:05:08.340> say<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.820> that<00:05:08.970> was<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> case<00:05:09.390> where<00:05:09.600> I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
gonna say that that was a case where I

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.570 
gonna say that that was a case where I
just<00:05:10.020> was<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.770> better<00:05:11.010> player<00:05:11.280> or<00:05:11.400> anything

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
just was a better player or anything

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.970 
just was a better player or anything
like<00:05:11.730> that<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:12.150> just<00:05:12.480> think<00:05:12.690> that<00:05:13.680> guy<00:05:13.860> was

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
like that I just think that guy was

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.860 
like that I just think that guy was
pretty<00:05:14.220> terrible<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:15.420> I'm<00:05:15.480> gonna<00:05:15.600> speed<00:05:15.840> up

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
pretty terrible so I'm gonna speed up

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.110 
pretty terrible so I'm gonna speed up
the<00:05:16.020> ac-130<00:05:16.530> again<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.280> there's<00:05:17.730> something<00:05:17.970> I

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
the ac-130 again and there's something I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.640 
the ac-130 again and there's something I
forgot<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.450> mention<00:05:18.750> actually<00:05:19.200> that<00:05:19.350> happened

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
forgot to mention actually that happened

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.460 
forgot to mention actually that happened
in<00:05:19.770> my<00:05:19.950> first<00:05:20.220> ac-130<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.390> can<00:05:21.540> go<00:05:21.690> back<00:05:21.900> and

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
in my first ac-130 you can go back and

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.250 
in my first ac-130 you can go back and
look<00:05:22.710> at<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.950> if<00:05:23.070> you<00:05:23.190> want<00:05:23.460> but<00:05:24.150> I<00:05:24.690> actually

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
look at it if you want but I actually

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.840 
look at it if you want but I actually
got<00:05:25.440> host<00:05:25.770> migration<00:05:25.950> in<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.490> middle<00:05:26.700> of<00:05:26.760> my

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
got host migration in the middle of my

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.930 
got host migration in the middle of my
ac-130<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.870> sped<00:05:28.140> up<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.500> first<00:05:28.710> time<00:05:28.950> and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
ac-130 that I sped up the first time and

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.250 
ac-130 that I sped up the first time and
you<00:05:30.030> might<00:05:30.210> not<00:05:30.360> have<00:05:30.420> saw<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.690> because<00:05:31.020> like<00:05:31.170> I

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
you might not have saw it because like I

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.650 
you might not have saw it because like I
said<00:05:31.320> sped<00:05:31.920> up<00:05:32.130> god<00:05:32.880> I'm<00:05:33.030> saying<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.420> word<00:05:33.570> a

said sped up god I'm saying that word a
lot<00:05:33.780> too<00:05:34.220> but<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.610> host<00:05:35.820> migration<00:05:36.000> took<00:05:36.540> away

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
lot too but the host migration took away

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.360 
lot too but the host migration took away
five<00:05:36.930> seconds<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.320> my<00:05:37.410> ec130<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.160> was<00:05:38.250> like

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
five seconds of my ec130 and I was like

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.540 
five seconds of my ec130 and I was like
oh<00:05:38.520> come<00:05:38.820> on<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:40.080> really<00:05:40.320> sucks<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.890> then<00:05:41.250> I

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
oh come on that really sucks and then I

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.780 
oh come on that really sucks and then I
noticed<00:05:42.090> at<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.450> end<00:05:42.600> of<00:05:42.720> my<00:05:42.780> ac-130<00:05:43.790> after

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
noticed at the end of my ac-130 after

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.180 
noticed at the end of my ac-130 after
the<00:05:44.970> 3<00:05:45.360> 2<00:05:45.540> 1<00:05:45.690> countdown<00:05:46.110> at<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.530> very<00:05:46.710> end<00:05:46.919> it

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
the 3 2 1 countdown at the very end it

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.550 
the 3 2 1 countdown at the very end it
gave<00:05:47.880> me<00:05:48.030> five<00:05:48.300> extra<00:05:48.660> seconds<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.350> it<00:05:49.440> was

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
gave me five extra seconds and it was

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.920 
gave me five extra seconds and it was
really<00:05:50.370> really<00:05:50.550> awesome<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.090> never<00:05:51.480> noticed

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
really really awesome I never noticed

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.380 
really really awesome I never noticed
that<00:05:51.990> before<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.620> as<00:05:53.160> far<00:05:53.340> as<00:05:53.400> I<00:05:53.580> know<00:05:53.640> that

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
that before and as far as I know that

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.240 
that before and as far as I know that
was<00:05:54.810> an<00:05:55.110> addition<00:05:55.530> into<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.860> game<00:05:56.010> because

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
was an addition into the game because

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.070 
was an addition into the game because
I'm<00:05:56.370> not<00:05:56.550> sure<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.790> I<00:05:57.000> was<00:05:57.120> always<00:05:57.270> there<00:05:57.570> now

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
I'm not sure that I was always there now

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.080 
I'm not sure that I was always there now
I<00:05:58.110> could<00:05:58.500> be<00:05:58.620> completely<00:05:58.800> wrong<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.669> could<00:05:59.970> be

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
I could be completely wrong I could be

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.700 
I could be completely wrong I could be
completely<00:06:00.510> out<00:06:00.660> of<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:01.020> loop<00:06:01.200> here<00:06:01.440> because

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
completely out of the loop here because

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.580 
completely out of the loop here because
that<00:06:02.190> tends<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:02.520> happen<00:06:02.730> a<00:06:02.970> lot<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.930> that

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
that tends to happen a lot and that

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.140 
that tends to happen a lot and that
might<00:06:04.830> have<00:06:04.919> been<00:06:04.980> standard<00:06:05.850> from<00:06:06.000> the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
might have been standard from the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.909 
might have been standard from the
