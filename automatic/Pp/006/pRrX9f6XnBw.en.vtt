00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.960
 the protest happened in front of the forum 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 of professional calves were 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.330
 denounce the dismissal of servers 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.119
 temporary staff from various departments of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.269
 prefecture as a watchdog who 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.609
 He worked for the city for ten years 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.920
 we had a meeting yesterday and they said 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.520
 for people who were on the edge of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.530
 body of fiscal responsibility that I 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 I believe that the civil service both 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.600
 teacher driver problem driver 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.110
 general services had nothing to do with 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.930
 that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.750
 the dismissal came to many employees 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 through this decree signed by the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 Mayor as it attaches to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.090
 recovery of personnel expenses 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.809
 according to the law of responsibility 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 fiscal but some points of the document 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:07.710
 are challenged by the doctor with the article 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.200
 3 of the decree that was sent to us is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.439
 wrong because the operation of the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 psf of the municipality as calves constitutes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.080
 an essential service to the population that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.509
 can be suspended in a brutal and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.790
 arbitrary in the way it was in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.090
 there has been a mass dismissal of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.970
 14 professionals simultaneously 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 physician who performed endoscopy 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 monthly report on layoffs in the sector 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.049
 this dismissal that the occurrence 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.840
 mass dismissal 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.549
 harms and much is the service 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 hospital and is effectively short oo 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.860
 basic health care for the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.960
 County 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.380
 students living in the countryside 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.780
 without school transportation 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.369
 prosecutors have received 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.020
 professional representatives 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.390
 dismissed 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 some measures will be taken by the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.840
 public ministry the first 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 providence that we will have to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.599
 take is not to harm the citizen and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 then try to resume services immediately 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.550
 which are continuous and have been interrupted 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.720
 now out so we will also seek to 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.970
 information from the city 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.250
 why is there such suspension today? 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.710
 of public services 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.940
 essential to the population 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.010
 so that we can give a 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 appropriate provision but the first 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.060
 will be the resumption of this 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 so that the population does not leave 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.780
 impaired
