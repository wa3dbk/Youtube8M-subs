would say it's about now a year and a

would say it's about now a year and a
half<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.409> that<00:01:24.280> August<00:01:24.609> or<00:01:24.789> is<00:01:24.909> being

growth curve in which we saw inflection

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.620 
growth curve in which we saw inflection
points<00:01:29.740> every<00:01:30.069> time<00:01:30.100> we<00:01:30.880> introduced<00:01:31.389> a<00:01:31.509> new

points every time we introduced a new

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.569 
points every time we introduced a new
feature<00:01:31.659> with<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.590> biggest<00:01:32.950> one<00:01:33.189> being<00:01:33.219> the

introduction of the new experience with
our<00:01:35.920> new<00:01:36.159> n8<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.759> our<00:01:36.850> new<00:01:37.060> symbian3<00:01:37.539> devices

our new n8 and our new symbian3 devices

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.669 
our new n8 and our new symbian3 devices
that<00:01:39.009> actually<00:01:39.490> has<00:01:39.899> caused<00:01:40.899> in<00:01:41.350> an

that actually has caused in an

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.730 
that actually has caused in an
incredible<00:01:42.719> uptake<00:01:43.719> which<00:01:43.990> was<00:01:44.109> very<00:01:44.259> visible

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
incredible uptake which was very visible

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.169 
incredible uptake which was very visible
on<00:01:44.889> the<00:01:44.920> statistics<00:01:45.579> in<00:01:45.759> which<00:01:45.909> for<00:01:46.149> example

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
on the statistics in which for example

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.919 
on the statistics in which for example
our<00:01:46.959> number<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:47.859> transactions<00:01:48.850> has<00:01:49.090> more<00:01:49.359> than

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
our number of transactions has more than

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.260 
our number of transactions has more than
doubled<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:51.100> also<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:54.219> way<00:01:55.029> people

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
doubled and and also the the way people

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.749 
doubled and and also the the way people
interact<00:01:55.569> with<00:01:56.499> the<00:01:56.709> services<00:01:57.189> change<00:01:57.549> to

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
interact with the services change to

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.109 
interact with the services change to
becoming<00:01:58.090> much<00:01:58.359> much<00:01:58.569> more<00:01:59.789> immersive<00:02:00.789> and

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
becoming much much more immersive and

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.419 
becoming much much more immersive and

users that come over and over again

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.210 
users that come over and over again

with<00:03:55.270> what<00:03:55.510> we<00:03:55.630> call<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.990> smart<00:03:56.320> install

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
with what we call the smart install

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.400 
with what we call the smart install

all the needed files that cute actually

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.710 
all the needed files that cute actually
that<00:04:02.170> constitute<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.680> QT<00:04:03.040> runtime<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.730> we

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
that constitute the QT runtime and we

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.680 
that constitute the QT runtime and we
call<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:04.960> smart<00:04:05.230> because<00:04:05.920> if<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:07.360> have<00:04:07.540> it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
call it smart because if you have it

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.570 
call it smart because if you have it
already<00:04:07.840> as<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> consumer<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.980> don't<00:04:09.310> need<00:04:09.460> to

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
already as a consumer you don't need to

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.760 
already as a consumer you don't need to
install<00:04:09.910> them<00:04:10.060> again<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.720> course<00:04:10.960> you<00:04:11.650> know

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
install them again so of course you know

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.070 
install them again so of course you know
you<00:04:11.830> can<00:04:12.220> safely<00:04:12.520> embed<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.450> your<00:04:13.510> app<00:04:13.750> and

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
you can safely embed it in your app and

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.260 
you can safely embed it in your app and
then<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.680> Installer<00:04:15.250> will<00:04:15.370> decide<00:04:15.910> whether

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
then the Installer will decide whether

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.479 
then the Installer will decide whether
the<00:04:16.540> user<00:04:16.989> needs<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.470> or<00:04:17.560> not<00:04:17.770> so<00:04:18.100> it's<00:04:18.250> really

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
the user needs it or not so it's really

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.460 
the user needs it or not so it's really
not<00:04:18.700> only<00:04:19.120> for<00:04:19.330> new<00:04:19.450> devices<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.049> it's<00:04:20.260> for

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
not only for new devices but it's for

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.190 
not only for new devices but it's for
the<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.980> know<00:04:21.100> most<00:04:21.790> of<00:04:22.120> our<00:04:22.390> devices<00:04:22.810> that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the you know most of our devices that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.390 
the you know most of our devices that
are<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.620> know<00:04:23.740> let's<00:04:23.950> say<00:04:24.070> they<00:04:24.220> have<00:04:24.370> a

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
are you know let's say they have a

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.010 
are you know let's say they have a
hardware<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.090> capable<00:04:25.480> enough<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.780> run

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
hardware that is capable enough to run

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.600 
hardware that is capable enough to run
those<00:04:26.170> applications<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.950> think<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
those applications I think the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.940 
those applications I think the
opportunity<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.240> had<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:28.930> actually<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.800> know

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
opportunity I had is actually you know

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.230 
opportunity I had is actually you know
almost<00:04:30.880> as<00:04:31.000> big<00:04:31.240> as<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.479> as<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.020> can

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
almost as big as I as I can

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.430 
almost as big as I as I can
imagine<00:04:32.630> what<00:04:33.530> we<00:04:33.710> see<00:04:33.979> is<00:04:34.250> that<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:35.660> high

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
imagine what we see is that the high

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.010 
imagine what we see is that the high
amount<00:04:37.099> of<00:04:37.340> engagement<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.180> we<00:04:38.389> see<00:04:38.630> in<00:04:38.810> the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
amount of engagement that we see in the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.600 
amount of engagement that we see in the
top<00:04:39.199> countries<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:39.949> actually<00:04:40.250> something<00:04:40.460> that

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
top countries is actually something that

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.760 
top countries is actually something that
is<00:04:40.819> spreading<00:04:41.120> really<00:04:41.750> rapidly<00:04:42.199> all<00:04:42.410> over<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
is spreading really rapidly all over the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.330 
is spreading really rapidly all over the
world<00:04:42.919> we<00:04:43.280> now<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.669> developers<00:04:44.210> in<00:04:45.340> in

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
world we now have developers in in

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.540 
world we now have developers in in
Africa<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.569> various<00:04:48.530> parts<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:48.919> Asia<00:04:49.130> we've

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
Africa in various parts of Asia we've

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.879 
Africa in various parts of Asia we've
really<00:04:50.000> like<00:04:50.240> starting<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.840> tap<00:04:51.139> into<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
really like starting to tap into a

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.820 
really like starting to tap into a
worldwide<00:04:52.720> creativity<00:04:53.720> which<00:04:54.289> I<00:04:54.440> think<00:04:54.710> we're

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
worldwide creativity which I think we're

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.909 
worldwide creativity which I think we're
very<00:04:54.860> well<00:04:55.490> equipped<00:04:55.849> to<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:57.470> leverage

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
very well equipped to to to leverage

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.680 
very well equipped to to to leverage
because<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.550> our<00:04:58.639> local<00:04:58.970> presence<00:04:59.479> we're

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
because of our local presence we're

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.870 
because of our local presence we're

really in every market with physical

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.850 
really in every market with physical
presence<00:05:02.330> we<00:05:02.419> understand<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.110> locality<00:05:03.710> we

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
presence we understand the locality we

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.460 
presence we understand the locality we
understand<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.970> issues<00:05:05.270> about<00:05:05.539> localization

we<00:05:06.800> offer<00:05:06.979> our<00:05:07.400> services<00:05:07.759> so<00:05:08.270> for<00:05:08.449> example<00:05:08.509> of

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
we offer our services so for example of

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.460 
we offer our services so for example of
it<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:10.009> a<00:05:10.039> ninth<00:05:10.940> for<00:05:11.270> ninety<00:05:11.720> percent<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:12.380> our

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
it is a ninth for ninety percent of our

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.260 
it is a ninth for ninety percent of our
user<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:13.099> available<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.819> local<00:05:14.120> language

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
user is available in the local language

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.480 
user is available in the local language
which<00:05:14.659> is<00:05:14.780> extremely<00:05:15.349> important<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.009> I<00:05:16.460> think

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
which is extremely important and I think

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.969 
which is extremely important and I think
as<00:05:16.970> we<00:05:17.419> start<00:05:17.720> rolling<00:05:18.110> out<00:05:18.259> more<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.830> more

as we start rolling out more and more

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.589 
as we start rolling out more and more

more into you know lowering the barrier

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.290 
more into you know lowering the barrier
of<00:05:24.500> entry<00:05:24.650> for<00:05:24.889> content<00:05:25.430> creation<00:05:25.699> like<00:05:26.030> we<00:05:26.180> do

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
of entry for content creation like we do

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.909 
of entry for content creation like we do
with<00:05:26.419> up<00:05:26.599> with<00:05:26.810> that<00:05:27.020> for<00:05:27.199> example<00:05:27.650> which<00:05:27.770> is<00:05:27.889> a

with up with that for example which is a

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.980 
with up with that for example which is a
fantastic<00:05:28.310> tool<00:05:28.789> to<00:05:29.240> be<00:05:29.389> able<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.750> create

content and apps with no coding then we

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.809 
content and apps with no coding then we
are<00:05:33.560> really<00:05:33.740> tapping<00:05:34.069> into<00:05:34.340> a<00:05:34.550> worldwide
