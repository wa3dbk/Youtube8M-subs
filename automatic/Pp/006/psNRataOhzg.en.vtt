00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello, I 'm Alexander Alexander Stems 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 today we will talk about the problem of depth 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:15.420
 sharpness in subject shooting and about one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:17.609
 from the ways to solve it subject shooting 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.830
 the issue of lack of depth of field arises 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 often the smaller the subject 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 more difficult if you do not know 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 what determines the depth of field wait 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.900
 Soon we will have a video on this topic if 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.330
 in portrait photography shallow depth 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.430
 sharpness is usually only at hand 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 during catalog shooting the object must be 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.010
 fully in focus close the aperture 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 to the limit 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 there will be no loss of quality 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.450
 due to diffraction so what 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.890
 do one of the use cases 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 tilt-shift lens but about him we 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 talk some other time 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.469
 Today we will consider much cheaper 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.070
 English version is called focus 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.899
 stacking 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 and if in Russian an increase in depth 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.980
 sharpen by gluing a few 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 photos with a focus on different parts 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.570
 shorter object will be called shorter 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
 it's stacking if you don't get it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.619
 from the name let's understand on 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.600
 practice so today we use to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.320
 shooting canon 5d mark 2 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.060
 lens 24 105a we take pictures of rice 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.470
 so as this is an example we use 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710
 constant light i usually use 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.259
 flash so the camera settings 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.960
 little will be different from us overvalued 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.030
 iso 1600 and shutter speed one 30 if you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.130
 there is a better way to use 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.270
 in order to completely eliminate any 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 camera offset 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.900
 well, or just be careful 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.659
 we focus manually and so 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.310
 focus on the front of the frame 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.320
 that's what happened now we shift 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.040
 focus on a few millimeters and do 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 next how 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.090
 so we take several frames 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.040
 and the number of frames will depend on 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.600
 situations from the subject you are shooting 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.640
 but in this case much better 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
 to overdo than not to finish because a lot 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.570
 time spent on transfer 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.640
 photos to and fro this we went through 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.560
 it's not very nice with shooting on it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.600
 everything is going to process and so we 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.340
 pumped our lightroom pics now i'm 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.280
 I will make export of photos dzhipeg 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.320
 exclusively for the speed of raw 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.140
 files the algorithm will remain exactly 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.730
 same so open photoshop you click 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.130
 file 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:30.500
 photo merchandise machine here we choose auto 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.600
 click the brows button find our files 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.660
 press ok 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.400
 they added remove the tick blend 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.140
 image 100 virgin wonderful accent 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.360
 Click ok and wait so we select all 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:56.090
 we have layers go into mode 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:58.470
 edit and click on the blend larce here 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.220
 leave all the settings as it is and 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.030
 we do not remove the tick press ok 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.750
 then everything is in sharpness except the edges now 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.230
 we will cut them and zashib everything 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.230
 So cool 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.660
 that's all with you was alexander stalks 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.660
 sky bye
