00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
is that you can't really tell the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.220 
is that you can't really tell the
difference<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:50.040> whole<00:03:50.520> lot<00:03:50.760> between<00:03:51.080> DVDs<00:03:52.080> and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
difference a whole lot between DVDs and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.920 
difference a whole lot between DVDs and
blu-rays<00:03:52.680> unless<00:03:53.070> it's<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.480> Pixar

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
blu-rays unless it's like the Pixar

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.220 
blu-rays unless it's like the Pixar
movies<00:03:55.350> or<00:03:55.680> sci-fi<00:03:56.460> action<00:03:57.120> movies<00:03:57.480> like

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
movies or sci-fi action movies like

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.900 
movies or sci-fi action movies like
comedies<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:58.980> stuff<00:03:59.220> like<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.580> heard<00:03:59.820> you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
comedies and stuff like that I heard you

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.450 
comedies and stuff like that I heard you
can't<00:04:00.090> really<00:04:00.270> tell<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.570> difference<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:01.460> when

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
can't really tell the difference so when

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.710 
can't really tell the difference so when
it<00:04:02.550> comes<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.850> that<00:04:03.030> I'm<00:04:03.180> probably<00:04:03.330> not<00:04:03.600> going

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
it comes to that I'm probably not going

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.690 
it comes to that I'm probably not going
to<00:04:03.780> buy<00:04:03.960> you<00:04:04.290> know<00:04:04.410> regular<00:04:04.770> blu<00:04:05.250> rays<00:04:05.490> that

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to buy you know regular blu rays that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.360 
to buy you know regular blu rays that
are<00:04:06.140> comedies<00:04:07.140> or<00:04:07.230> whatever<00:04:07.500> because<00:04:08.100> they're

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
are comedies or whatever because they're

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 
are comedies or whatever because they're
like<00:04:08.459> 30<00:04:08.790> bucks<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.600> I'll<00:04:09.959> probably<00:04:10.080> stick<00:04:10.440> to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
like 30 bucks so I'll probably stick to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.100 
like 30 bucks so I'll probably stick to
DVDs<00:04:10.950> for<00:04:11.130> those<00:04:11.450> but<00:04:12.450> when<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.720> comes<00:04:12.900> to

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
DVDs for those but when it comes to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.990 
DVDs for those but when it comes to
Pixar<00:04:13.590> movies<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.250> sci-fi<00:04:14.459> action

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
Pixar movies and the sci-fi action
