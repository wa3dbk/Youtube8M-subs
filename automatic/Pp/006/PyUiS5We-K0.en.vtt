00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.410
 hello i have a little do it today 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.039
 yourself for you and as it really is 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.859
 a little one of the 11 and that is what I have 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.020
 here at this top first something 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.270
 I'll show you that now as 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.510
 first so that I do not remember because 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.619
 you see tip is totally broken and 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.420
 that 's why I have that easy 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.880
 I tried to try it out 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.120
 not so accurate and you can see that 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.469
 again a small pattern is the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.559
 also cut out a bit diagonally 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.800
 but that did not really matter to me 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.319
 knows now was test 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.829
 and yes I just got me in 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:51.420
 internet a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.339
 a galaxy print picked so to speak 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.960
 have the printed and not on 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.969
 normal paper but on this 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.699
 transfers the links I'm referring to you 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.920
 also infobox 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.460
 so that you can buy it and that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.619
 it costs 5 euros and that is 858 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.509
 So it's totally in there for me 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.490
 order and you can do everything possible 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.979
 so you can make faces too 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.710
 t-shirts printed and what I know 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.479
 something for christmas no idea 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.890
 I also printed something here 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.500
 I do not have that right now 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:29.079
 printed but if I totally the since 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.020
 I love love love you see on 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.640
 I would like to have one myself 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.259
 We can not keep any animals because of that 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.560
 yes, unfortunately, but I think this pug really 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.140
 cute 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.899
 this is the here and there but I then 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.000
 one more printed t-shirt and more 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.670
 I also have the instructions in the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.190
 afterwards 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.650
 made this and indeed it is this 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.640
 this is a normal mustache and 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.310
 I just got it from the internet 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.100
 again selected in print and found here 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.720
 I actually pretty and now 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.110
 have to be so aztec style for me that is 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.770
 here 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 and yes I think actually pretty nice 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.890
 and we can really do anything with it 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.960
 this transfer ps I finds really 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.650
 practically you can do everything possible 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.390
 you can print as you said 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.000
 somehow something special for the birthday 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.300
 create this for girlfriends and make 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.140
 I think it's a good option 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.140
 to bring out his creativity 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.910
 so to speak 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.930
 and yes, then I would say go 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.930

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.530
