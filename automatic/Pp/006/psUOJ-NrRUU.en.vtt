00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
they should add to the Enderdragon to

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.240 
they should add to the Enderdragon to
make<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:49.660> that<00:01:49.810> step<00:01:50.110> better<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.710> make<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.070> more

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
make it that step better to make it more

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.830

important and a little bit harder to

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.320 
important and a little bit harder to
fight<00:01:53.200> because<00:01:53.440> for<00:01:53.860> me<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.490> wither<00:01:54.730> boss<00:01:55.030> has

fight because for me the wither boss has

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.360 
fight because for me the wither boss has
its<00:01:55.510> own<00:01:55.720> direction<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.560> goes<00:01:56.710> river<00:01:56.980> it<00:01:57.130> once

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
its own direction it goes river it once

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.250 
its own direction it goes river it once
while<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.090> Enderdragon<00:01:58.720> does<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.020> same
