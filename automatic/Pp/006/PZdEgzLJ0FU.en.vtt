00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.160
 so with the friend didier the vine we have 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.230
 signed another August so route from 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.760
 chamonix up to zermatt speak to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 collar the glaciers what they 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.719
 hike so you have to remember well 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 that there are three ways to connect 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.310
 two capitals of the Alps the first 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 way it is on foot by the paths 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 by the hillsides so that gave rise to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 a hiking book that has 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 was written by françois éric cormier 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.480
 we released last year this is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 the second opus so it's the high road 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.219
 from the neck that goes through the high mountain 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.190
 to connect the two capitals of the Alps 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.489
 and will come a third title under the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.379
 feather of françois matthey who will describe the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.600
 high road for hiking 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.700
 glacial so there ski touring 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.700
 but we find that my itineraries 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.620
 domloup so here we described four 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.300
 combinations because obviously on the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.039
 high road one can combination of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 combine all the steps possible 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.420
 and unimaginable according to the refusals 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.890
 we choose to school more or less 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.850
 obligatory so there one to recombine 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.159
 four steps four routes forgiveness 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 the classic high road which is the one 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.330
 which is the most used the most 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.770
 attended by professionals the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 mountain guides that is sold 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 by the companies guides the agencies and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.210
 its 95% hiking deskur that goes 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.700
 take this route in seven days 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.159
 from samouni to zermatt and then 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.159
 on the historical route we have a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 full itinerary ie without 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.960
 mechanical connection when we pass the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 ferry ferrer and then a little 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.189
 originality we described another August to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.290
 upside down ie a route of 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.810
 zermatt in Chamonix but which is not 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.729
 just the reverse route that has 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.399
 really been thought for skiers for 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.740
 favor the big ski so the idea of 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.710
 do four routes actually 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.450
 a lot of topo in all the all the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.979
 steps are explained in every 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.299
 topos and c be a little clutter 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.750
 so the idea was to really do 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.530
 four routes well differentiate 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.930
 classical routes as said 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.930
 Francois who goes through their 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.479
 verbier plaster hut in fleury so 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.910
 a very used route the other 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.300
 that we have described as passing history 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 by borough saint-pierre valsorey le 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.800
 corridor plateau which is one of the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.709
 steps which is very very famous in the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.959
 college is really important in the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.470
 Chablis early in the morning 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.510
 this route a route that is not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.700
 often borrowed but that pleases many 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.500
 to people who is the other full August 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.120
 that we passed through the fouly pass du 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.900
 great saint bernard and for saint 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.060
 Bernard who is who really combines a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.810
 high mountain route without 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.660
 taxi and bus connection and that is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.860
 really a 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.110
 we are in the mountains during 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.270
 seven days find her very nice and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.590
 the other August upside down so all the 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.750
 world is talking about it a bit like 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.459
 the arlesienne in May no one sees it in 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.090
 do we cross people who make their 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.940
 guests upside down but by doing all 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.890
 the all the steps going to do 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.360
 photos passing next to each other 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.760
 I realized that there was really 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.170
 a nice route to find using 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.930
 four beautiful descents that are the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.750
 descent on a role to wear them the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.280
 down the corridor plateau up 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.440
 borough st pierre and finish with their 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.690
 Glaciers of the tour until chamonix finally 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.370
 the tour so it's 4 beautiful route I 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.709
 think is for you that he is the most beautiful 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.360
 route on which themes were 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.400
 customers 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.380
 but in fact the most beautiful is the most 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.670
 beautiful route is not necessarily the one 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.440
 that we actually prefer is the one who 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.549
 is the most suitable for customers and 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.799
 it's true that we end up with 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.950
 who are we going to say 4 4 routes of 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.890
 different gradation pretty much one with 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.140
 the acid that is going to be rather for the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.190
 less sporting history for those who 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.760
 have less time but want 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.600
 to do something already more complicated 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.430
 the integral that will be much more 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.590
 long with more distance from larger 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.630
 steps the other green talent who 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.070
 finally to descents that 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.220
 favors descents a little 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.120
 steep so the most beautiful if if we like 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.489
 the descent is true that others 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.739
 hotels in glass is nice before 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.230
 talk about the construction of the book I 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.480
 I'll remind you that every racing car 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.609
 you're not to the guide these are two tools that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.459
 are completely different a topo that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.410
 allow to prepare his raid it allows 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.180
 to imagine the terrain on which we are going 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.840
 but obviously according to his 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.669
 experience 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.139
 it does not replace the guidance of a guide 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.070
 high mountain but it's really 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.580
 important to remind him 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.500
 and this is also a tool that will 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.720
 to be a medium of memories since the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.710
 rate principle koshiji th edition ci 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.720
 is to rely on a rich 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.199
 iconography say that there are a lot of 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.120
 pictures and every day every serving 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.710
 of the stage is traced on photo it is 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.169
 really one of the originalities of this 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.060
 topo on the high road and so on 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.620
 every step we find what is so 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.970
 every step is built so 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.340
 systematic with a profile a map 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.710
 simplified that refers to the map ign or 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.169
 to the dopo swift card and then after 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.030
 each portion of the stage will be traced 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.139
 on a different photo with a short 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.600
 descriptive yes odéon did not want to 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.850
 to make a topo guide that is shown 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.789
 only the courses we tried to 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.460
 to back it up with a beautiful 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.820
 preface already of gilles ravanel one of 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.530
 descendants to bring back the red that 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.240
 had made the first highway but 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.320
 also and ben day all the history 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.500
 how to make your bag 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.599
 the gps the use of the gps who is who 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.340
 does not protect crevasses but hey 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.380
 explains a little c was made by Gilles 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.500
 fleury is someone uses a lot the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.370
 gps there is the methodology on all this 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.410
 which is difficulty the equipment the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.240
 collective material so something 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.950
 which is very interesting and the records 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.050
 we also talk about records 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.210
 it's true that in recent years 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.880
 are some teams between dynafit mine 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.560
 who pulls himself a little death for for 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.660
 make the chamonix record at zermatt in 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.360
 ski touring so here's what to read 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.900
 and what to do during the evenings 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.900
 big barrels
