00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
hey I'm Stephen the pen man I've got the

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.900 
hey I'm Stephen the pen man I've got the
deodorizer<00:00:03.720> pouch<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.500> show<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.740> today<00:00:05.040> this

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
deodorizer pouch to show you today this

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.690 
deodorizer pouch to show you today this
is<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> little<00:00:06.450> bit<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.839> different<00:00:06.870> product

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
is a little bit of a different product

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.040 
is a little bit of a different product
most<00:00:08.700> people<00:00:09.000> don't<00:00:09.179> even<00:00:09.240> understand<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:09.929> it

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
most people don't even understand how it

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.900 
most people don't even understand how it
works<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.620> let's<00:00:11.160> go<00:00:11.309> ahead<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:11.670> talk

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
works so let's go ahead and just talk

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.419 
works so let's go ahead and just talk
about<00:00:12.090> some<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.719> how<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.380> potentially<00:00:14.219> could

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
about some of how this potentially could

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.390 
about some of how this potentially could
be<00:00:14.580> used<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.170> actually<00:00:16.350> works<00:00:16.560> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
be used and how it actually works so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.849 
be used and how it actually works so
what's<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.240> what<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.680> is

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
what's in here what is in here is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.800 
what's in here what is in here is
actually<00:00:20.070> proprietary<00:00:21.029> blend<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.630> natural

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
actually proprietary blend of natural

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.700 
actually proprietary blend of natural
crystals<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.890> actually<00:00:23.699> absorbs<00:00:24.480> odors<00:00:24.710> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
crystals that actually absorbs odors and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.429 
crystals that actually absorbs odors and
it<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.580> works<00:00:27.000> by<00:00:27.240> taking<00:00:27.449> ammonia<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
it really works by taking ammonia out of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.429 
it really works by taking ammonia out of
there<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.460> friends<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.390> there's<00:00:30.599> urine<00:00:30.960> or

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
there so friends as if there's urine or

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.340 
there so friends as if there's urine or
if<00:00:32.369> there's<00:00:32.640> any<00:00:32.969> kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> other<00:00:33.540> odors<00:00:33.960> maybe

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
if there's any kind of other odors maybe

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
if there's any kind of other odors maybe
out<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.770> garbage<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.780> mostly<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.140> used

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
out of a garbage can mostly this is used

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.520 
out of a garbage can mostly this is used
in<00:00:37.559> animal<00:00:37.980> enclosures<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> 12<00:00:40.050> by<00:00:40.230> 4

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
in animal enclosures this is the 12 by 4

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.770 
in animal enclosures this is the 12 by 4
inch<00:00:40.710> model<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.430> sell<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.540> actually

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
inch model that we sell and it actually

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.190 
inch model that we sell and it actually
does<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> great<00:00:43.649> job<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:44.360> anywhere<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.690> around<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
does a great job of anywhere or around a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.910 
does a great job of anywhere or around a
50<00:00:46.620> gallon<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.840> 20<00:00:48.840> gallon<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> mean<00:00:49.739> basically

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
50 gallon on 20 gallon I mean basically

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
50 gallon on 20 gallon I mean basically
20<00:00:50.520> gallons<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.120> 10<00:00:51.719> gallon<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
20 gallons and up 10 gallon this is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.560 
20 gallons and up 10 gallon this is
awful<00:00:52.829> big<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> certainly<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.239> take<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
awful big but it certainly will take the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.319 
awful big but it certainly will take the
odors<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> 10<00:00:55.379> gallon<00:00:55.590> enclosure<00:00:56.489> but

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
odors out of a 10 gallon enclosure but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
odors out of a 10 gallon enclosure but
um<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.289> more<00:00:58.590> purpose<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.489> being

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
um it has more purpose than just being

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.049 
um it has more purpose than just being
used<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.539> an<00:01:00.930> enclosure<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> said<00:01:02.250> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
used in an enclosure and like I said you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.299 
used in an enclosure and like I said you
know<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.510> anywhere<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.199> 10<00:01:04.830> gallons

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
know probably anywhere from 10 gallons

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.330 
know probably anywhere from 10 gallons
250<00:01:05.880> gallons<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.159> can

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
250 gallons but if you use to you can

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.160 
250 gallons but if you use to you can
even<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.180> bigger<00:01:09.510> enclosure<00:01:09.930> by

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
even put this into a bigger enclosure by

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
even put this into a bigger enclosure by
using<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.950> each<00:01:11.189> side<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
using one on each side if you have a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
using one on each side if you have a
much<00:01:12.689> bigger<00:01:12.930> enclosure<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> 6-foot

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
much bigger enclosure like a 6-foot

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.039 
much bigger enclosure like a 6-foot
enclosure<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
enclosure but what I like about this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
enclosure but what I like about this
product<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.650> all-natural<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
product is this all-natural and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
product is this all-natural and
basically<00:01:18.509> will<00:01:18.869> remove<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> odors<00:01:19.799> simply

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
basically will remove the odors simply

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
basically will remove the odors simply
by<00:01:20.909> placing<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> enclosure<00:01:22.439> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
by placing this into the enclosure you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.660 
by placing this into the enclosure you
can<00:01:23.369> hang<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.689> tape<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.460> way

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
can hang it you can tape it in any way

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
can hang it you can tape it in any way
you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> inside<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.350> enclosure

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you want to get it inside the enclosure

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.950 
you want to get it inside the enclosure
is<00:01:28.979> fine<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:29.970> sure<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> animal

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
is fine just make sure that the animal

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.870 
is fine just make sure that the animal
can't<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> rip<00:01:32.189> open<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.640> mesh

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
can't get to it and rip open the mesh

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
can't get to it and rip open the mesh
again<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.420> natural<00:01:33.780> crystals<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
again it's natural crystals but at the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.990 
again it's natural crystals but at the
same<00:01:34.979> time<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.310> don't<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.759> product

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
same time you don't want the product

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
same time you don't want the product
destroyed<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.290> how<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.250> works<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> will

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
destroyed so how this works is it will

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.590 
destroyed so how this works is it will
continue<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.170> absorb<00:01:40.680> odors<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.909> about<00:01:42.180> 30

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
continue to absorb odors for about 30

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
continue to absorb odors for about 30
days<00:01:43.070> after<00:01:44.070> 30<00:01:44.280> days<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.729> simply<00:01:45.119> need<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
days after 30 days you simply need to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
days after 30 days you simply need to
recharge<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.229> crystals<00:01:46.680> how<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
recharge the crystals how do you do that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.389 
recharge the crystals how do you do that
very<00:01:48.299> easily<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> simply<00:01:49.649> lay<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.220> out

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
very easily you can simply lay this out

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.639 
very easily you can simply lay this out
in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> Sun<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:51.930> eight<00:01:52.140> hours<00:01:52.170> until
