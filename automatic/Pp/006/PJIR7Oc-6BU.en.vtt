00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
in the last episode I thought we were

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.419 
in the last episode I thought we were
actually<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> first<00:00:10.889> round<00:00:11.099> against<00:00:11.370> the

actually in the first round against the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.759 
actually in the first round against the
any<00:00:11.610> other<00:00:11.790> paces<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.660> no<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.349> actually<00:00:13.500> took

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
any other paces but no we actually took

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.110 
any other paces but no we actually took
on<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> Charlotte<00:00:14.340> Bobcats<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.910> first

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
on the Charlotte Bobcats in the first

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.700 
on the Charlotte Bobcats in the first
round<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.660> whatever<00:00:15.839> reason<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.350> didn't

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
round and for whatever reason I didn't

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.439 
round and for whatever reason I didn't
