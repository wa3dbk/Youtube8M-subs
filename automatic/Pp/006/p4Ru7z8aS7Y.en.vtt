00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.590 
wrap furnace around wrap and set it on
top<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:55.930> refrig<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:57.970> have<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.390> put<00:01:58.570> a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
top of the refrig if you have to put a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.690 
top of the refrig if you have to put a
little<00:01:58.750> bit<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.650> scotch<00:01:59.920> tape<00:02:00.160> somewhere<00:02:00.490> to

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
little bit of scotch tape somewhere to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.340 
little bit of scotch tape somewhere to
hold<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:01.030> down<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.330> start<00:02:01.600> that's<00:02:01.780> fine<00:02:02.110> but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
hold it down the start that's fine but

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.550 
hold it down the start that's fine but
so<00:02:02.530> far<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.740> haven't<00:02:02.950> had<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.250> use<00:02:03.280> any<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.729> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so far I haven't had to use any of that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.140 
so far I haven't had to use any of that
and<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.100> easier<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.550> do<00:02:06.640> if<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.850> pull<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
and this is easier to do if you pull the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.370 
and this is easier to do if you pull the
fridge<00:02:07.300> off<00:02:07.450> from<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.690> wall<00:02:07.870> -<00:02:08.080> we<00:02:08.229> do<00:02:08.350> that

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
fridge off from the wall - we do that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.070 
fridge off from the wall - we do that
every<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:08.800> often<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.100> clean<00:02:09.369> behind<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.790> fridge

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
every so often to clean behind a fridge

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.480 
every so often to clean behind a fridge
it's<00:02:11.080> way<00:02:11.230> easier<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.590> do<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.250> let's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
it's way easier to do to do that let's

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.210 
it's way easier to do to do that let's
