00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.440
 after the disappointing fall the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.430
 violets on monday preparation for 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.920
 started earlier 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.189
 the mood fits under the training plan 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.130
 Not so good either, so we have ours 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.390
 of course then keep the good mood 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.529
 usual things 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.699
 week by week increase the intensity 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:37.070
 third week is a training camp with 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:39.020
 three good and good international opponents 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.809
 Then we will be in the fourth week 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.830
 have the most intense week and then 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.750
 we still have two weeks for 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.750
 championship instead of winter preparation 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.250
 means to refuel by force in bad weather 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.650
 in the annual cycle of a soccer player 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.659
 certainly not the most popular time fun 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.220
 it should do it because of it 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.980
 if you work hard then that too 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.960
 Fruit harvesting is in the form of a lot 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.780
 good fitness if you have good fitness 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.090
 then you can 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.310
 actually be a better athlete 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.440
 and there that is the goal i believe that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.049
 We 're having a good level now 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.600
 in the spring can start on what 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.290
 We can have built up in the autumn 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 build up well 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.740
 Of course we want a lot of fun too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.380
 with the troupe we want one 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.360
 of course, the. want to become a good team 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.950
 output targets we alone yet 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.200
 can reach a speaker we can 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.649
 there in the cape still in the process to the cup 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.450
 final 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.520
 we can actually become cupsieger 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.190
 we are four points behind the second 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.140
 as everything is still in the area of 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.670
 feasible and of course that is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.050
 our task is that we now 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 requirement to create it sooner 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.590
 templates to meet 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.929
 Winter preparation is also transfer 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.789
 time even if there are already some 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.710
 There are rumors about gerald baumgartner 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.929
 not with big changes in the squad 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.990
 It will not be great changes 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:05.159
 Of course, there can always be something 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.690
 happen like his 30 well and have it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.250
 quite normal in the in the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.649
 still winter preparation that one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.350
 or others can happen 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.350
 we'll see what happens or if that 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.269
 Immediately I want to stay 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370
 than work there with the troupe 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.340
 I am provided by 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 Verein winter preparation also means 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.820
 define goals 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.030
 after the disappointing fall is a 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.549
 successful earlier all the more important 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 my head is one of our goals in the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.959
 We can reach the spring 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.870
 have spent so would be optimal 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.549
 Of course the second place you have to 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.239
 we all strive so that must be ours 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.160
 own expectations also our own 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.380
 expectant demanding on ourselves be 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.790
 and yes it is not so in autumn 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.079
 run optimally 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.549
 but we still have each other 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:02.070
 fought back and I think that we 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.510
 That too we achieve what we what we 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.459
 we want to achieve as we become hard 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.760
 work and I think that 's more 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.760
 suffice
