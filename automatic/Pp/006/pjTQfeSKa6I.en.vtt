can<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.359> mutants<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> stuff<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

box we buy we actually get an alien and
Bronze<00:00:47.730> Star<00:00:48.500> might<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.620> pretty<00:00:49.890> good<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
Bronze Star might be pretty good to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
Bronze Star might be pretty good to
actually<00:00:50.579> buy<00:00:50.670> these<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:52.079> barely

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
actually buy these if you're barely

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.029 
actually buy these if you're barely

starting off and we get a bronze and
silver<00:00:56.219> star<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.789> bad<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.180> 120<00:00:58.190> cuz<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
silver star not bad for 120 cuz the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
silver star not bad for 120 cuz the
Silver<00:00:59.550> Star<00:00:59.730> cost<00:00:59.940> 850<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.870> that's<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.230> bad

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
Silver Star cost 850 so that's not bad

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
Silver Star cost 850 so that's not bad
at<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.739> we're<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.149> other

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
at all we're gonna be going to the other

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719 
at all we're gonna be going to the other
box<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> trying<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> out<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.580> hopefully<00:01:05.580> get

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
box and trying it out now hopefully get

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.130 
box and trying it out now hopefully get
something<00:01:05.909> better<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> Silver<00:01:07.080> Star

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
something better we get a Silver Star

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.300 
something better we get a Silver Star
and<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:07.560> passes<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.970> great<00:01:10.189> but<00:01:11.189> it's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and some passes not that great but it's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
and some passes not that great but it's
only<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> hundred<00:01:11.760> twenty<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.240> Silver<00:01:12.659> Star<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
only a hundred twenty so Silver Star is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.840 
only a hundred twenty so Silver Star is
gonna<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.200> worth<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
gonna be worth it and we actually get a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
gonna be worth it and we actually get a
gold<00:01:15.119> star<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.320> guess<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> gold

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
gold star so I guess when you get a gold

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.570 
gold star so I guess when you get a gold
star<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.310> only<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:19.020> worth<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
star you only get one are they worth it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.890 
star you only get one are they worth it
maybe<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.729> mean<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.420> orbs<00:01:21.659> out

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
maybe I mean you can get some orbs out

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
maybe I mean you can get some orbs out
of<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.950> pretty<00:01:23.220> nice<00:01:23.400> isn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of this one which is pretty nice isn't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
of this one which is pretty nice isn't
even<00:01:23.909> somebody<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.080> we're<00:01:25.170> gonna

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
even somebody get you know we're gonna

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.770 
even somebody get you know we're gonna
buy<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.369> orb

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
buy one more there is an orb

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
buy one more there is an orb
we<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> boost<00:01:28.259> +7<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.430> don't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
we got the boost +7 which they don't

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
we got the boost +7 which they don't
even<00:01:29.700> sell<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> shop<00:01:32.900> I've<00:01:33.900> seen<00:01:34.049> somebody

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
get a level 2 which was pretty crazy

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.420 
get a level 2 which was pretty crazy
yeah<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.380> don't<00:01:37.590> even<00:01:37.799> sell<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> shop

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
which is pretty nice does help out 7

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.840 
which is pretty nice does help out 7
percent<00:01:41.490> boost<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:43.430> would<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.520> liked<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
percent boost I would have liked the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.810 
percent boost I would have liked the
level<00:01:45.090> 2<00:01:45.210> though<00:01:45.710> but<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.340> cost<00:01:47.549> hundred

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
level 2 though but it only cost hundred

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.080 
level 2 though but it only cost hundred
twenty<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.840> spend<00:01:49.079> more<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:49.470> but

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
twenty I would spend more on these but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.039 
twenty I would spend more on these but
there's<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.240> telling<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.899> get
