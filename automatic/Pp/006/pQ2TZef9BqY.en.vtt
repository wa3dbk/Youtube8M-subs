definitely going to enjoy this well at
last<00:02:15.230> if<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:16.190> do<00:02:16.250> patch<00:02:16.579> it<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.970> don't<00:02:17.599> see<00:02:17.750> why

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
last if they do patch it I don't see why

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.390 
last if they do patch it I don't see why
they<00:02:17.989> would<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.680> wouldn't<00:02:18.920> really<00:02:19.010> make<00:02:19.190> much

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
they would it wouldn't really make much

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.110 
they would it wouldn't really make much
sense<00:02:20.379> because<00:02:21.379> maybe<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:22.430> whatever<00:02:22.610> reason

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
sense because maybe for whatever reason

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.550 
sense because maybe for whatever reason
