the new Horizons spacecraft and Pluto

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.370 
the new Horizons spacecraft and Pluto
and<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:08.550> calling<00:00:09.090> flour<00:00:09.360> genitals<00:00:09.990> there<00:00:10.260> it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
and I'm calling flour genitals there it

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.160 
and I'm calling flour genitals there it
is<00:00:10.500> poppycock<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.639> all<00:00:11.910> fraud<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:12.990> will

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
is poppycock it's all fraud and I will

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099 
is poppycock it's all fraud and I will
demonstrate<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.940> simple<00:00:15.420> aspect<00:00:15.900> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
demonstrate with one simple aspect and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.050 
demonstrate with one simple aspect and
there<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.350> many<00:00:16.619> aspects<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.430> demonstrate

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
there are many aspects that demonstrate

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.990 
there are many aspects that demonstrate
this<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.080> gonna<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.770> compare<00:00:20.670> my

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this what I'm gonna do is compare my

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.080 
this what I'm gonna do is compare my
telescopic<00:00:21.840> backyard<00:00:22.500> shots<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.580> NASA's

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
telescopic backyard shots to NASA's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.019 
telescopic backyard shots to NASA's
sweet<00:00:24.570> shot<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.439> space<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> telescope<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
sweet shot in space with a telescope of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.019 
sweet shot in space with a telescope of
the<00:00:27.119> same<00:00:27.330> size<00:00:27.660> shot<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:29.849> thing

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the same size shot so the first thing

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.639 
the same size shot so the first thing
we're<00:00:30.150> gonna<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:31.009> look<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.649> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
we're gonna do here is look at the the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.650 
we're gonna do here is look at the the
kind<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.980> telescope<00:00:35.190> camera<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
kind of telescope camera that is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.260 
kind of telescope camera that is
supposedly<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.559> new<00:00:37.860> horizon<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:39.059> this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
supposedly on the new horizon what this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.569 
supposedly on the new horizon what this
says<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.620> eight-point<00:00:41.309> two

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
says is they have an eight-point two

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.690 
says is they have an eight-point two
inch<00:00:41.910> telescope<00:00:42.570> attached<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> CCD<00:00:44.190> which

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
inch telescope attached to a CCD which

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400 
inch telescope attached to a CCD which
is<00:00:44.850> basically<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.329> telescope<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> digital

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is basically a telescope to a digital

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.560 
is basically a telescope to a digital
camera<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.730> exactly<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> have

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
camera that is exactly what I have

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
camera that is exactly what I have
except<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> 0.2<00:00:50.399> inches<00:00:50.730> bigger

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
except this one is 0.2 inches bigger

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.709 
except this one is 0.2 inches bigger
than<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:52.050> 8<00:00:52.289> inch<00:00:52.530> telescope<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.449> there

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
than my 8 inch telescope so right there

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080 
than my 8 inch telescope so right there
you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> 8<00:00:56.190> inch<00:00:56.219> tube<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you can see them with the 8 inch tube of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.770 
you can see them with the 8 inch tube of
this<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.050> suppose<00:00:59.120> similar<00:01:00.120> Smit<00:01:00.480> cast

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this kind of I suppose similar Smit cast

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.000 
this kind of I suppose similar Smit cast
screen<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.500> didn't<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.829> up

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
screen I don't know I didn't look up

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
screen I don't know I didn't look up
what<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> style<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> looks<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
what the style is but it looks like a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
what the style is but it looks like a
short<00:01:04.019> tube<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> probably<00:01:05.100> even

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
short tube so it's probably even

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
short tube so it's probably even
configured<00:01:05.909> similar<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:06.990> mine<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.409> not

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
configured similar to what mine is not

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
configured similar to what mine is not
sure<00:01:07.830> about<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.000> with

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
sure about that but there they are with

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.240 
sure about that but there they are with
the<00:01:10.220> 8.2<00:01:11.600> telescopic<00:01:12.600> camera<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.470> don't<00:01:14.130> know

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the 8.2 telescopic camera I don't know

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.230 
the 8.2 telescopic camera I don't know
whether<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> call<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.820> lens<00:01:15.030> or<00:01:15.210> a

telescope whatever and here is the big

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.090 
telescope whatever and here is the big
showpiece<00:01:18.540> craft<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.350> probably<00:01:19.680> sitting

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
showpiece craft that's probably sitting

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399

in a Burbank Hollywood sound stage
somewhere<00:01:23.130> who<00:01:23.520> knows<00:01:24.350> but<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
somewhere who knows but this is so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
somewhere who knows but this is so
fraudulent<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.390> couldn't<00:01:27.630> let<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
fraudulent that I just couldn't let it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
on a ccd or digital camera and here is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340 
on a ccd or digital camera and here is
my<00:01:37.439> rig<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.479> telescope<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
my rig this is my first telescope it is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.940 
my rig this is my first telescope it is
an<00:01:40.500> 8<00:01:40.799> inch<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.490> 0.2<00:01:42.119> inches<00:01:42.420> smaller<00:01:43.049> attached

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
an 8 inch so 0.2 inches smaller attached

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.990 
an 8 inch so 0.2 inches smaller attached
to<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> ccd<00:01:45.149> camera<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:45.869> digital<00:01:46.579> camera<00:01:47.579> which

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
to a ccd camera or digital camera which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880 
to a ccd camera or digital camera which
is<00:01:48.149> exactly<00:01:48.630> how<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:48.960> describe<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> camera

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
is exactly how they describe the camera

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
is exactly how they describe the camera
they're<00:01:50.070> using<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.880> let's<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
they're using so let's look at what I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230 
they're using so let's look at what I
can<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.170> from<00:01:52.470> my<00:01:52.649> backyard<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.520> let's<00:01:54.030> keep

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can do from my backyard and let's keep

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.550 
can do from my backyard and let's keep
in<00:01:54.479> mind<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> average<00:01:56.310> distance<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.899> am

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
in mind the average distance that I am

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.280 
in mind the average distance that I am
shooting<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.219> is<00:02:01.310> 484<00:02:02.310> million<00:02:02.909> miles<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
shooting here is 484 million miles so I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.770 
shooting here is 484 million miles so I
shot<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.009> through<00:02:05.549> atmosphere<00:02:05.850> through

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
shot this through atmosphere through

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839 
shot this through atmosphere through
supposed<00:02:07.560> Van<00:02:08.009> Allen<00:02:08.399> belt

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
supposed Van Allen belt

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.750 
supposed Van Allen belt
through<00:02:09.420> temperature<00:02:10.019> changes<00:02:10.619> my<00:02:11.519> light

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
through temperature changes my light

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.759 
through temperature changes my light
refracted<00:02:12.239> as<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.749> supposedly<00:02:13.230> left<00:02:13.560> our

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
refracted as it supposedly left our

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.520 
refracted as it supposedly left our
atmosphere<00:02:14.400> right<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.840> overexposed

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
atmosphere right here it is overexposed

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.770 
atmosphere right here it is overexposed
to<00:02:16.650> show<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.189> moons<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.359> I<00:02:18.389> will

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
to show you the moons but now I will

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.479 
to show you the moons but now I will
begin<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.200> tune<00:02:19.409> it<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.040> you've<00:02:20.189> got<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
begin to tune it in and you've got to

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.610 
begin to tune it in and you've got to
realize<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.849> am<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.569> city<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.319> shooting

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
realize I am in a city so the shooting

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.940 
realize I am in a city so the shooting
here<00:02:22.889> is<00:02:23.129> never<00:02:23.519> great<00:02:23.879> but<00:02:24.599> there's<00:02:25.049> my<00:02:25.439> kind

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
here is never great but there's my kind

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.520 
here is never great but there's my kind
of<00:02:26.129> video<00:02:26.579> shot<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.629> when<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> take<00:02:28.109> stills

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
of video shot now when I take stills

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
of video shot now when I take stills
they<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.129> get<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> bit<00:02:29.549> better<00:02:29.819> let's<00:02:30.150> take<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
they can get a bit better let's take a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.119 
they can get a bit better let's take a
quick<00:02:30.750> look<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.139> what<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.829> stills

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
quick look at what I can do with stills

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.659 
quick look at what I can do with stills
here<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:33.150> m42<00:02:33.930> also<00:02:34.620> known<00:02:34.859> as<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.189> Orion

Nebula and to be completely fair to
astrophotographers<00:02:39.419> out<00:02:39.599> there<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.109> not

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
astrophotographers out there this is not

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.129 
astrophotographers out there this is not
that<00:02:40.769> great<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.129> shot<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.669> just<00:02:41.939> isn't<00:02:42.269> because

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
that great a shot it just isn't because

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.280 
that great a shot it just isn't because
I<00:02:43.409> have<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.950> much<00:02:44.129> city<00:02:44.430> light<00:02:44.669> pollution<00:02:45.290> I'm

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
I have so much city light pollution I'm

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.259 
I have so much city light pollution I'm
never<00:02:46.739> going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.099> get<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> sweet<00:02:47.669> shots<00:02:47.969> where

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
never going to get the sweet shots where

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.390 
never going to get the sweet shots where
I<00:02:48.299> am<00:02:48.629> compared<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.349> what<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:49.530> people<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.219> do

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
I am compared to what some people can do

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.490 
I am compared to what some people can do
but<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.239> we're<00:02:51.389> gonna<00:02:51.480> do<00:02:51.750> here<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.169> again

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
but what we're gonna do here is again

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.619 
but what we're gonna do here is again
look<00:02:52.799> at<00:02:52.980> Jupiter<00:02:53.219> that<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.969> forget<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.599> I

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
look at Jupiter that I forget what I

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.830 
look at Jupiter that I forget what I
just<00:02:54.870> told<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.699> 480<00:02:56.699> some<00:02:57.180> million<00:02:57.569> miles

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
just told you 480 some million miles

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
few million miles away and I just showed

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.740 
few million miles away and I just showed
you<00:03:40.439> what<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:40.859> can<00:03:41.069> do<00:03:41.189> with<00:03:41.340> my<00:03:41.549> scope<00:03:41.909> shooting

you what I can do with my scope shooting

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.499 
you what I can do with my scope shooting
we<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.049> told<00:03:43.379> four<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.699> five<00:03:44.909> hundred<00:03:45.329> million

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
we are told four to five hundred million

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.499 
we are told four to five hundred million
miles<00:03:46.049> away<00:03:46.319> with<00:03:46.650> Jupiter<00:03:47.159> now<00:03:47.909> they<00:03:48.239> claim

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
miles away with Jupiter now they claim

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.749 
miles away with Jupiter now they claim
this<00:03:48.840> things<00:03:49.109> about<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.739> surface<00:03:50.159> area<00:03:50.489> or

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
this things about the surface area or

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.270 
this things about the surface area or
the<00:03:50.939> size<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.840> think<00:03:52.139> they<00:03:52.229> say<00:03:52.409> Missouri<00:03:53.099> or
