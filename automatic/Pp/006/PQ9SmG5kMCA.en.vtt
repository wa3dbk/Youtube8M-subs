00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.549
 at the beginning and they do not put that, it's because I already 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.709
 I noticed that there are many people who 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.299
 they follow us but they do not know well we have a 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.290
 channel of jokes that is called talk

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.400

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 delicious with the quotes of sweets and you 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.550
 I will explain why I am 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 teaching this recipe since to sicily 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 of my birthday, well, in fact, a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.180
 month then during this time I'm going 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.070
 to give pure ideas for your parties or 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.250
 meetings whether they are sandwiches 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 decorations drinks many things like that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.020
 let's see how this recipe is made 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.570
 so easy and delicious 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.580
 first what you need are three cups 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.220
 of cereals for example I use of 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.110
 different flavors two cups of chocolates 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.060
 that's why they are great but also 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.680
 you can use little ones we're going to 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.080
 use two tablespoons of butter 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 so that they are very soft and many 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.579
 candy to fill 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.009
 to make the way of our 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.350
 little baskets we're going to need a tray 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.049
 for cupcakes in this case we're going to do 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.119
 12 to fire very very shortly you are going to put your 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.740
 butter in a pot and you're going to pour 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 your chocolates are going to move them 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 constantly because it sticks very easy 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.560
 between the little ones 600 chocolates better 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.560
 because that way they will melt very fast 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.710
 when almost everyone is melted 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.730
 more to pay the fire and you're going to move it 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.730
 very fast everything 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.950
 you are going to put a serial bottle and you are going to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.870
 start moving everything you're going to return 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 with a spoon that is easier and you will 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.830
 start to spin until everyone 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.290
 have been stuck by their plates to 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.300
 put the oil cupcakes tray for 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 that we do not get stuck with our 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.950
 what you need now you are going to pour your 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.050
 mixture to the mold cited and going to start 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.720
 Shaping a basket starts with the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.710
 walls and then in the background and ready 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.710
 is our first basket 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.650
 and if you want to be chocolate, be it 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 chocolate missing a little sparks 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 chocolate 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.120
 Now I'm going to make this basket with 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.370
 chocolate bonbon 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.069
 and we're going to let them cool for 30 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.319
 minutes until they are hard already 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.480
 that have passed the 30 minutes you go to 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.019
 take out your baskets and you'll put them in 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.019
 a dish 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.290
 and finally you're going to put your candy 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.290
 favorites 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.370
