00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello to all of you for this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.370
 new video so let's watch 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.720
 how to start safe mode from 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 windows so that can be emphasize 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 the windows ps psista windows 7 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.269
 windows 8 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.219
 good brief all versions 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 of windows there is no problem then 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 after me I will be this windows 7 for the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.920
 tutorial and it will be under a machine 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.609
 virtual that would be virtualized by 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 virtual box 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.830
 so I'm going to get started the software is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 then launched my machine so here 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 then at startup you press 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.960
 leaks continuously all this for 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 land on the options menu of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 windows that has multiple features 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.530
 like repair the computer enable the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.540
 age debug mode enable video base 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 resolution 640 by 480 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.200
 In short, it's full of features 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 many and varied but we what will 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.190
 to interest us especially it's going to be the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.230
 safe mode then in parentheses 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.800
 speaking of various options and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.210
 varied from those of this options menu 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.559
 fix the computer or debug mode h 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 it is to take with tweezers well 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 heard because good it's not with 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.570
 experience it's not very very 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.300
 performing 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.619
 we're going to say that like that and then 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.840
 way if you use it two options 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.000
 you do with the arrows you move 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 and then he has here there is a small 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 description of each option this is the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.460
 you hesitate between this or that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.290
 option if you hesitate to launch it or 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.320
 not you read the description and then 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 that's all right so let's go back to our 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.330
 sheep 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 we are interested in the mode 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.740
 without fail then we can notice 4 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.619
 safe mode we have the first mode 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.049
 chess monkeys which therefore allows us to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.280
 launch our machine without taking in 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.020
 network load 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 so in fact we will not have internet on 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.470
 will not be able to set the tone of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.750
 day off so so you in your case 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.150
 you need the network obviously going 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.829
 you take the second option then 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.180
 let's admit if you just need to 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.920
 the notice of orders to put your 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.869
 small command lines obviously 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.130
 you take the third option then 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.200
 we in our case we will just take 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.149
 the first option that will allow us 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.689
 to launch an administrator session of 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.360
 your pc 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.979
 but who will not launch any programs and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.369
 features at startup of the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.380
 session 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.780
 which will allow us not to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.579
 launch the virus because some viruses 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 start at the start of your session 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.910
 so is you can not launched 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.340
 of antivirus you can not launch two 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.200
 programs that will remove this virus in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.940
 question 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.800
 and then that's where the mode without 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.230
 failure to take into account is that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.400
 do we run it the virus is not going 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.260
 to get started but the problem is that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970
 our Russian dj either so in fact 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.920
 our goal is that once we 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.410
 will be on assignment in safe mode 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.420
 we're just going to launch 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.819
 malwarebytes or anti voting player 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.569
 virus to turn this virus and be 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.630
 quiet 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.489
 then to start safe mode 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.380
 you are therefore expired at the start of 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.140
 your pc so you get to this menu 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.360
 you wander with the arrows of the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.810
 bottom and top and once the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.720
 the option and highlighted you press 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.950
 quietly on entry and that's the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.510
 safe mode is charging 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.250
 automatically 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.510
 so do not worry if you see 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.940
 these command lines it's quite 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.010
 normal and so you will arrive on the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.599
 question usual administrators then 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.829
 that's how it's the mode without 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.780
 simply failure 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.340
 so I tell you next time for 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.340
 future video subscribe to cha cha
