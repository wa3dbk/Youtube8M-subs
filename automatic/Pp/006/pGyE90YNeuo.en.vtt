series of videos put into a playlist and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
series of videos put into a playlist and
when<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> first<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.100> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
just song though they were on my mind

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.249 
just song though they were on my mind
because<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.640> watching<00:01:50.970> maniac<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.990> bricks

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because I was watching maniac for bricks

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
because I was watching maniac for bricks
do<00:01:52.530> those<00:01:52.680> come<00:01:52.909> commercial<00:01:53.909> reviews<00:01:54.479> so

do those come commercial reviews so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.020 
do those come commercial reviews so
that's<00:01:54.810> why<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> did<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.560> I'd<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> do

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's why I did that but I'd like to do

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
that's why I did that but I'd like to do
it<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.329> something<00:01:57.659> more<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it so something more it's like more on a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
it so something more it's like more on a
just<00:01:59.130> something<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.700> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> be

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
just something that it's going to be

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.550 
just something that it's going to be
something<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.469> be

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
something I think that's going to be

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.459 
something I think that's going to be
quick<00:02:01.920> short<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.240> attention

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
quick short and get your attention

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.480 
quick short and get your attention
otherwise<00:02:04.469> people<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> check

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
otherwise people are just going to check

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.730 
otherwise people are just going to check
out<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.689> brings<00:02:06.810> me<00:02:06.960> up<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> second

out and that brings me up to the second

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340 
out and that brings me up to the second
subject<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.399> stealing<00:02:09.209> people's<00:02:09.629> ideas
