particular a highly poisonous fruit
luckily<00:00:25.869> most<00:00:26.439> of<00:00:26.650> them<00:00:26.800> have<00:00:27.099> well<00:00:27.400> an

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
luckily most of them have well an

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
always going to succeed for time and

always going to succeed for time and
quite<00:02:58.879> often<00:02:59.120> which<00:02:59.569> may<00:02:59.810> take<00:03:00.110> many<00:03:00.560> multiple

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
quite often which may take many multiple

quite often which may take many multiple
attempts<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.849> different<00:03:02.390> types<00:03:02.660> of

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
your target species once again you'll

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.390 
your target species once again you'll
soon<00:03:23.269> figure<00:03:23.690> out<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.049> best<00:03:24.290> method<00:03:24.890> with<00:03:25.370> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
soon figure out the best method with a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.569 
soon figure out the best method with a
higher<00:03:25.700> success<00:03:26.120> rate<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:26.810> yes<00:03:27.470> often<00:03:28.099> you

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
higher success rate and yes often you

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.970 
higher success rate and yes often you
may<00:03:28.849> look<00:03:29.120> like<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.359> bit<00:03:29.629> of<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.810> stooge<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.500> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
may look like a bit of a stooge in the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.690 
may look like a bit of a stooge in the
process<00:03:35.680> got<00:03:36.680> him<00:03:36.829> pretty<00:03:37.010> good<00:03:37.099> that's<00:03:37.519> for

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
process got him pretty good that's for

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.140 
process got him pretty good that's for
sure

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
sure

hey<00:03:38.959> mate<00:03:39.370> quickly<00:03:40.370> what<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:40.549> like<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.970> do<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.209> I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
hey mate quickly what I like to do is I

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.940 
hey mate quickly what I like to do is I
like<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:41.510> chase<00:03:41.840> them<00:03:42.019> into<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.319> crane<00:03:42.709> where

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
like to chase them into a crane where

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.830 
like to chase them into a crane where
it's<00:03:43.069> nice<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.489> thick<00:03:43.730> where<00:03:44.389> there's<00:03:44.569> logs

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
it's nice and thick where there's logs

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.860 
it's nice and thick where there's logs
big<00:03:45.379> branches<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.519> more<00:03:46.730> jumping<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.690> more

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
big branches the more jumping the more

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.199 
big branches the more jumping the more
maneuvering<00:03:48.410> he<00:03:48.590> has<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.889> do<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.549> more<00:03:49.760> energy

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
maneuvering he has to do the more energy

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.530 
maneuvering he has to do the more energy
tighter<00:03:51.169> again<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:52.579> all<00:03:52.790> about<00:03:52.819> picking

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
tighter again so it's all about picking

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.750 
tighter again so it's all about picking
a<00:03:53.599> location<00:03:54.250> forcing<00:03:55.250> him<00:03:55.370> towards<00:03:55.669> that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
a location forcing him towards that

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.789 
a location forcing him towards that
location<00:03:56.150> but<00:03:56.840> most<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.169> all<00:03:57.319> it's<00:03:57.590> about

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
location but most of all it's about

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.659 
location but most of all it's about
being<00:03:58.069> persistent<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.530> when<00:04:00.829> do<00:04:01.069> you<00:04:01.099> start<00:04:01.459> to

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
being persistent so when do you start to

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.640 
being persistent so when do you start to
notice<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.329> you've<00:04:02.480> spent<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.109> long<00:04:03.379> in<00:04:03.440> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
notice that you've spent so long in the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.789 
notice that you've spent so long in the
bush<00:04:03.889> that<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.519> start<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:05.090> go<00:04:05.269> crazy<00:04:05.799> well

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
bush that you start to go crazy well

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.960 
bush that you start to go crazy well
kind<00:04:07.609> of<00:04:07.760> when<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.120> starts
