hello<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.490> video<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.940> will<00:00:12.120> show<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.389> how

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
hello in this video I will show you how

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.250 
hello in this video I will show you how
to<00:00:12.719> monetize<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:14.570> pants<00:00:15.570> which<00:00:15.750> don't<00:00:16.080> get

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
to monetize this pants which don't get

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.439 
to monetize this pants which don't get
stuck<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.710> magnetic<00:00:17.279> pallets<00:00:17.850> because<00:00:18.119> they

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
stuck on magnetic pallets because they

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
stuck on magnetic pallets because they
are<00:00:18.570> aluminum<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.439> they<00:00:19.680> don't<00:00:19.920> stick<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
are aluminum and they don't stick to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.099 
are aluminum and they don't stick to
magnets<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.480> videos<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
magnets and so I think in some videos I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.830 
magnets and so I think in some videos I
seen<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:26.160> alternative<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.599> one

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
seen some alternative like this one

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.089 
seen some alternative like this one
sticking<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:29.480> metal<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.170> magnetized

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
sticking some metal that is magnetized

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.790 
sticking some metal that is magnetized
to<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> bottom<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.719> over<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.590> tongue

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to the bottom of the over the tongue

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
to the bottom of the over the tongue
that's<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> bad<00:00:35.760> idea

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that's not a bad idea

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
that's not a bad idea
but<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> better<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
but I think there is a better one you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.030 
but I think there is a better one you
just<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.870> yourself<00:00:40.280> some<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.489> these

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
just have to get yourself some of these

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.130 
just have to get yourself some of these
magnetic<00:00:44.040> stickers<00:00:44.940> I've<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.899> some

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
magnetic stickers I've got some

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.810 
magnetic stickers I've got some
publicity<00:00:46.500> ones<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.730> maybe<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.309> all<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
publicity ones or maybe the all the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.799 
publicity ones or maybe the all the
magnetic<00:00:51.120> paper<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
magnetic paper that that is all in the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.889 
magnetic paper that that is all in the
craft<00:00:55.289> stores<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.250> ones<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
craft stores like this ones and then you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.910 
craft stores like this ones and then you
get<00:00:58.079> yourself<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:59.510> punch<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
get yourself a punch like this one this

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
get yourself a punch like this one this
is<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.370> small<00:01:02.760> I've<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.539> big<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.019> here

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is a bit small I've got a big one here

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
is a bit small I've got a big one here
these<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.700> expensive<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.900> about

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
these are not expensive this is about

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.060 
these are not expensive this is about
six<00:01:07.770> euros<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> those<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
six euros so you get one of those and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
six euros so you get one of those and
then<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:12.680> make<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.979> hole<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:17.750> then<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
then you make a hole like that then you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
then you make a hole like that then you
have<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.229> magnetic<00:01:19.860> disk<00:01:20.189> ready<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.119> be

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
have your magnetic disk ready to be

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.320 
have your magnetic disk ready to be
stuck<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> bottom<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:24.299> your

strong<00:01:37.200> holding<00:01:38.189> power<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.920> put<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.250> matte

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
strong holding power so I put the matte

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.899 
strong holding power so I put the matte
side<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.860> magnetic<00:01:44.369> paper<00:01:44.549> not

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
side of the of the magnetic paper not
the<00:01:45.090> shiny<00:01:45.450> side<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> magnetic<00:01:46.770> one

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the shiny side which is the magnetic one

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.580 
the shiny side which is the magnetic one
that's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.790> matte<00:01:48.000> side<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> these

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that's the matte side on one of these

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
that's the matte side on one of these
greatest<00:01:50.540> drops<00:01:53.000> dots<00:01:54.000> blue<00:01:54.570> dots<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.420> now

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
greatest drops dots blue dots and now

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.010 
greatest drops dots blue dots and now
it's<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.090> stick<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's on there and that's it I stick it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.530 
it's on there and that's it I stick it
to<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> bottom<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.799> palm

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.620 

now<00:02:07.540> watch<00:02:07.900> this<00:02:08.200> trick<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.090> put<00:02:10.360> this

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
now watch this trick when you put this

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.050 
now watch this trick when you put this
on<00:02:11.080> your<00:02:11.380> magnetic<00:02:11.800> palette<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.580> may<00:02:12.760> think

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
on your magnetic palette you may think

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.449 
on your magnetic palette you may think
it's<00:02:13.209> not<00:02:13.270> magnetized<00:02:14.080> because<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.010> doesn't

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
it's not magnetized because it doesn't

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's not magnetized because it doesn't
stick<00:02:15.790> because<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.080> do<00:02:17.200> some<00:02:17.650> trick

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
stick because you have to do some trick

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.300 
stick because you have to do some trick
you<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.819> turn<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.890> notice<00:02:20.890> when<00:02:21.130> it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
you have to turn it and notice when it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.210 
you have to turn it and notice when it
really<00:02:22.030> gets<00:02:22.230> magnetized<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.650> bottom<00:02:24.069> of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
really gets magnetized to the bottom of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.340 
really gets magnetized to the bottom of
the<00:02:24.430> palette<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.239> there<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.870> is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the palette and there it is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.920 
the palette and there it is
there<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.650> magnetized<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.720> now

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
there is magnetized you see this is now

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.690 
there is magnetized you see this is now
magnetized<00:02:33.209> because<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.800> direction<00:02:36.489> of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
magnetized because the the direction of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.600 
magnetized because the the direction of
the<00:02:36.910> magnet<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.959> important<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.010> place

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the magnet is important when you place

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.110 
the magnet is important when you place
this<00:02:40.650> magnet<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:42.040> magnetic<00:02:42.430> papers

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
this magnet with these magnetic papers

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.840 
this magnet with these magnetic papers
so<00:02:43.840> if<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.470> put<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.160> way<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
so if you put it in a way that is the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.880 
so if you put it in a way that is the
direction<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.489> direction<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.330> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
direction of the the direction of the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.050 
direction of the the direction of the
magnet<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> same<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.819> as<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
magnet is not the same one as the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.110 
magnet is not the same one as the
duration<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.230> magnet<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.120> bottom

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
duration of of the magnet in the bottom

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.800 
duration of of the magnet in the bottom
of<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.420> pan<00:02:55.690> your<00:02:56.650> yours<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.940> shadow<00:02:58.209> won't<00:02:58.480> get

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
of the pan your yours I shadow won't get

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.229 
of the pan your yours I shadow won't get
magnetic<00:02:59.470> but<00:02:59.709> if<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.130> turn<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.760> when<00:03:01.060> you

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
magnetic but if you turn it when you

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.410 
magnetic but if you turn it when you
find<00:03:01.569> that<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.170> gets<00:03:02.470> stuck<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.190> just<00:03:03.430> roll<00:03:04.390> it

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
find that it gets stuck you just roll it

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.280 
find that it gets stuck you just roll it
like<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
like this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.140 
like this
turn<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.680> there<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:08.549> now<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:09.790> stuck<00:03:12.150> so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
turn it there you see now it's stuck so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.430 
turn it there you see now it's stuck so
now<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:13.930> can<00:03:14.290> move<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.160> sideways<00:03:16.109> but<00:03:17.109> maybe

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
now you can move it sideways but maybe

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.400 
now you can move it sideways but maybe
not<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:18.250> way<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.690> want<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.989> put<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.260> there

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
not that way you want to put it there

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.940 
not that way you want to put it there
yes<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:22.690> see<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.079> of<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.530> does<00:03:23.739> the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
yes you see because of the does the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.830 
yes you see because of the does the
reaction<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.180> magnet

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
reaction of the magnet

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.270 
reaction of the magnet
in<00:03:25.900> their<00:03:26.200> pallet<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.280> little

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
in their pallet so this is the little

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.460 
in their pallet so this is the little
trick<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.180> don't<00:03:31.600> want<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.930> buy<00:03:32.109> one<00:03:32.440> of

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
trick if you don't want to buy one of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:41.780 
trick if you don't want to buy one of
these<00:03:32.829> or<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.609> have<00:03:35.160> what<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.519> also<00:03:36.700> do

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.810 

what<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:43.120> also<00:03:43.299> do<00:03:43.660> is<00:03:43.959> just<00:03:44.560> make<00:03:44.920> trace

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
what you can also do is just make trace

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:55.670 
what you can also do is just make trace
the<00:03:46.180> size<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.970> any<00:03:49.239> paper

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.399 

and<00:03:56.400> then<00:03:57.650> place<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.890> on<00:03:59.040> top<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.489> the<00:04:00.409> magnetic

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
and then place it on top of the magnetic

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:10.270 
and then place it on top of the magnetic
paper<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.950> have<00:04:05.599> and<00:04:06.599> cut<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.140> same<00:04:07.170> size

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.190 

so<00:04:11.280> now<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.549> get<00:04:11.879> our<00:04:12.060> circle<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.720> size<00:04:12.900> of

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
so now you get our circle the size of

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.960 
so now you get our circle the size of
these<00:04:14.299> ready<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.540> be<00:04:15.659> magnet<00:04:16.519> stuck<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
these ready to be magnet stuck to the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.420 
these ready to be magnet stuck to the
pallet<00:04:18.509> let's<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.859> matte<00:04:20.039> part

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
pallet let's see this is the matte part

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.960 
pallet let's see this is the matte part
so<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.389> will<00:04:21.870> add<00:04:22.049> some<00:04:22.470> glue<00:04:22.770> dots<00:04:23.009> here<00:04:23.699> and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.150 

there<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.510> then<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.320> look<00:04:31.979> at<00:04:32.130> your

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
there it is then you look at your

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.600 
there it is then you look at your
palette<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.660> put<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.020> on<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.710> then<00:04:35.070> this

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
palette you put it on it and then this

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.930 
palette you put it on it and then this
time<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:35.910> did<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.169> first<00:04:37.410> coat

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
time I did it on the on the first coat

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.460 
time I did it on the on the first coat
we<00:04:38.940> want<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.389> keep<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.780> name<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.199> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
we want to keep the name of the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.270 
we want to keep the name of the
eyeshadow<00:04:41.430> on<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:41.820> reference<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.690> all<00:04:42.810> that

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280

sticky<00:04:46.830> papers<00:04:47.639> oh<00:04:57.259> this<00:04:58.259> magnet<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.919> strong

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
sticky papers oh this magnet is strong

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.700 
sticky papers oh this magnet is strong
enough<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.580> stick<00:05:00.090> through<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.389> paper<00:05:00.750> just

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
enough to stick through the paper just

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.570 
enough to stick through the paper just
put<00:05:01.949> it<00:05:02.070> there
