yeah that's one of the Givens of course

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.870 
yeah that's one of the Givens of course
I'll<00:01:43.590> run<00:01:43.860> something<00:01:44.220> else<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.580> second

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I'll run something else in the second

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.130 
I'll run something else in the second

kind<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.740> resolutions<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:53.870> so<00:01:54.870> I'm<00:01:54.960> just

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
kind of resolutions you get so I'm just

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:04.980 
kind of resolutions you get so I'm just
escaping<00:01:56.220> my<00:01:56.460> way<00:01:56.550> back<00:01:56.820> out

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.990 

not<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:05.740> easy<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.979> play<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.189> game<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.790> of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
not so easy to play a game on this of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.180 
not so easy to play a game on this of
course<00:02:07.030> because<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.979> interval<00:02:08.979> s<00:02:09.069> you

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
course because of the interval s you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.990 
course because of the interval s you
have<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.569> controller's<00:02:14.760> keyboard<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
have the controller's keyboard and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.449 
have the controller's keyboard and
keyboard<00:02:16.810> versus<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> touchscreen<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.980> not

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
keyboard versus a touchscreen is not

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:32.759 
keyboard versus a touchscreen is not
optimal<00:02:20.280> there<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.370> go

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:45.610 

okay<00:02:37.120> mouse<00:02:38.120> ah<00:02:43.810> yeah<00:02:44.810> I'm<00:02:45.140> pretty<00:02:45.349> good<00:02:45.560> at

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
okay mouse ah yeah I'm pretty good at

00:02:45.620 --> 00:03:01.830 
okay mouse ah yeah I'm pretty good at
this<00:02:49.480> full<00:02:50.480> play<00:02:50.750> experience

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.589 

perhaps<00:03:02.379> books<00:03:02.800> movies<00:03:07.590> same<00:03:08.590> Wi-Fi<00:03:08.800> connect

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
perhaps books movies same Wi-Fi connect

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.979 
perhaps books movies same Wi-Fi connect
same<00:03:10.599> distance<00:03:11.050> from<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.290> router<00:03:11.410> everything

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
same distance from the router everything

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.990 
same distance from the router everything
but<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.319> can<00:03:17.410> see<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.660> android<00:03:20.019> pc<00:03:20.319> works

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
but as you can see the android pc works

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.960 
but as you can see the android pc works
quite<00:03:22.000> as<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.180> raspberry<00:03:22.569> pi<00:03:23.970> unfortunately

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
quite as the raspberry pi unfortunately

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.150 
quite as the raspberry pi unfortunately
doesn't<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:27.330> my<00:03:28.330> opinion<00:03:28.720> works<00:03:29.530> too<00:03:29.799> slow<00:03:30.099> to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
doesn't in my opinion works too slow to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:39.289 
doesn't in my opinion works too slow to
make<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.580> usable<00:03:33.239> skype<00:03:34.239> available<00:03:34.870> plex

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.080 

place<00:03:40.299> can<00:03:40.510> be<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> little<00:03:40.840> bit<00:03:41.049> term

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
place can be a little bit term

00:03:42.090 --> 00:04:01.250 
place can be a little bit term
temperamental<00:03:43.090> at<00:03:43.180> times<00:03:43.209> I've<00:03:43.630> discovered

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:14.930 

again<00:04:02.360> definitely<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.390> reasonable<00:04:03.930> speed

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:33.970

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.530 

it's<00:04:34.610> not<00:04:34.730> going<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:34.940> compare<00:04:35.180> with<00:04:35.330> your

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
it's not going to compare with your

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.240 
it's not going to compare with your
desktop<00:04:36.410> because<00:04:36.650> we're<00:04:36.950> doing<00:04:37.040> everything

of course using a fairly low powered

in these android Duncan sees the whole

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.170 
in these android Duncan sees the whole
situation<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:56.930> going<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.170> become<00:04:57.500> very

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
situation is going to become very

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.420 
situation is going to become very
different<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.330> can<00:04:59.510> foresee<00:05:03.250> there<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:04.310> go

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
different I can foresee there you go

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.460 
different I can foresee there you go
there's<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.910> basic<00:05:06.190> run-through<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:08.470> the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
there's a basic run-through of the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.920 
there's a basic run-through of the
functionality<00:05:11.320> settings<00:05:12.320> are<00:05:12.680> again<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.930> have

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
functionality settings are again I have

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.700 
functionality settings are again I have
of<00:05:15.080> course<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.440> internal<00:05:16.190> ended<00:05:16.430> at<00:05:16.550> a

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
of course the internal ended at a

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.990 
of course the internal ended at a
microSD<00:05:18.710> up<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.820> 32<00:05:20.210> gigabyte<00:05:20.720> storage<00:05:21.230> slot

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
microSD up to 32 gigabyte storage slot

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.280 
microSD up to 32 gigabyte storage slot
so<00:05:23.000> you<00:05:23.030> can<00:05:23.210> fit<00:05:23.420> quite<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:23.690> bit<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:23.960> stuff<00:05:24.020> on

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
so you can fit quite a bit of stuff on

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.820 
so you can fit quite a bit of stuff on
here<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:28.220> say<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.400> least<00:05:29.170> as<00:05:30.170> a<00:05:30.230> media<00:05:30.650> center

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
here to say the least as a media center

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.350 
here to say the least as a media center
this<00:05:31.430> can<00:05:31.640> work<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:34.490> fact<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.880> might<00:05:35.030> find

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
this can work in fact I might find
