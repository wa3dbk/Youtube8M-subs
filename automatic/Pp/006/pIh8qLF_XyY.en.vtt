you'll see is we have this touchflo 2d
system<00:01:00.650> is<00:01:00.830> what<00:01:01.070> they<00:01:01.460> call<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.850> rather<00:01:02.480> than

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
system is what they call it rather than

can do this thing down the bottom with
the<00:04:38.570> scroll<00:04:39.020> bar<00:04:39.229> you<00:04:39.650> would<00:04:39.950> hope<00:04:40.070> that<00:04:40.130> they

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
the scroll bar you would hope that they

the scroll bar you would hope that they
could<00:04:40.520> do<00:04:41.120> some<00:04:41.360> more<00:04:41.540> levels<00:04:41.960> of

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
could do some more levels of

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.350 
could do some more levels of
customization<00:04:42.950> on<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> top<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.060> stuck<00:04:44.270> at

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
customization on the top you stuck at

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.350 
customization on the top you stuck at
the<00:04:44.450> start<00:04:44.720> bar<00:04:44.930> here<00:04:45.410> which<00:04:46.100> is<00:04:46.280> again<00:04:46.970> tiny

the start bar here which is again tiny

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.270 
the start bar here which is again tiny
finicky<00:04:48.050> fairly<00:04:48.470> ineffective<00:04:49.010> if<00:04:49.130> you're

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
headset at the same time but I guess

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.890 
headset at the same time but I guess
these<00:06:10.160> days<00:06:10.430> nearly<00:06:11.240> everyone's<00:06:11.630> going<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:11.840> be

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
these days nearly everyone's going to be

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.710 
these days nearly everyone's going to be
using<00:06:12.080> a<00:06:12.260> Bluetooth<00:06:12.710> headset

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
using a Bluetooth headset

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.810 
using a Bluetooth headset
and<00:06:13.810> it's<00:06:14.230> probably<00:06:14.410> not<00:06:14.830> so<00:06:15.160> much<00:06:15.340> of<00:06:15.550> an

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
and it's probably not so much of an

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.230 
and it's probably not so much of an
issue<00:06:17.130> so<00:06:18.130> all<00:06:18.280> in<00:06:18.460> all<00:06:18.550> I<00:06:18.610> probably<00:06:18.910> give<00:06:19.120> this

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
issue so all in all I probably give this

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.210 
issue so all in all I probably give this
about<00:06:19.450> a<00:06:19.510> 6<00:06:19.870> out<00:06:20.080> of<00:06:20.110> 10<00:06:20.410> it's<00:06:20.770> certainly<00:06:21.160> the
