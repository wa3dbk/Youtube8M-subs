00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
before we had the player audio I heard

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.650 
before we had the player audio I heard
him<00:00:11.160> all<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> way<00:00:11.639> at<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.790> gassing<00:00:12.240> desk<00:00:12.450> that

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
him all the way at the gassing desk that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.499 
him all the way at the gassing desk that
he<00:00:12.780> was<00:00:12.929> yelling<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> he's<00:00:14.849> uh<00:00:14.880> he's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.180 
he was yelling and so he's uh he's
definitely<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> vocal<00:00:16.379> player<00:00:16.619> he's<00:00:16.770> got<00:00:17.010> that

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
definitely a vocal player he's got that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.150 
definitely a vocal player he's got that
uh<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.520> swagger<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.449> Kent<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.350> saying<00:00:19.619> he

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
uh that swagger as I Kent was saying he

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.040 
uh that swagger as I Kent was saying he
adds<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> team<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.840> want

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
adds that to the team if you want

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
adds that to the team if you want
swagger<00:00:22.410> check<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.800> old<00:00:23.010> spice<00:00:23.310> maybe

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
swagger check out old spice maybe

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.290 
swagger check out old spice maybe
because<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.779> did<00:00:26.119> anyways<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
because that's what I did anyways to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.609 
because that's what I did anyways to
make<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> even<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.750> simple<00:00:28.349> though<00:00:28.470> we're

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
make it even more simple though we're

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
make it even more simple though we're
gonna<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.890> complexity<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> yellow

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
gonna have complexity with the yellow

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840 
gonna have complexity with the yellow

don't<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> gear<00:00:43.110> changes<00:00:43.710> hit

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
don't see a lot of gear changes hit

either<00:00:47.270> possible<00:00:48.270> spec<00:00:48.510> changes<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.989> don't

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
either possible spec changes I don't

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100 
either possible spec changes I don't
foresee<00:00:49.890> anything<00:00:50.160> happening<00:00:51.020> yeah<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
foresee anything happening yeah and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.930 
foresee anything happening yeah and
complexity<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> both<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> rounds<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
complexity in both of the rounds that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
complexity in both of the rounds that
we've<00:00:54.090> seen<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.510> far<00:00:54.750> has<00:00:55.230> been<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.620> aggressor

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we've seen so far has been the aggressor

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
we've seen so far has been the aggressor
they've<00:00:56.489> given<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:57.030> their<00:00:57.239> defensive

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
they've given up their defensive

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.029 
they've given up their defensive
position<00:00:58.230> around<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.649> pillar<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
position around the pillar at the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
position around the pillar at the
beginning<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> charged<00:01:00.149> into<00:01:00.390> eg<00:01:00.719> both

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
beginning and charged into eg both

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.299 
beginning and charged into eg both
rounds<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.379> looks<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.890> were<00:01:01.949> mounted

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
rounds it looks like they were mounted

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
rounds it looks like they were mounted
up<00:01:02.430> prepared<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> same<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.229> let's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
up prepared to do the same here let's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
up prepared to do the same here let's
see<00:01:04.890> how<00:01:05.309> EG<00:01:05.729> handles<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.689> riding<00:01:07.140> into

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
see how EG handles them all riding into

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530 
see how EG handles them all riding into
them<00:01:07.560> getting<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.010> top<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:09.330> looks

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
them getting on top of them now looks

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
them getting on top of them now looks
like<00:01:09.600> nuts<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:10.409> has<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> sale<00:01:10.979> targeted

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
like nuts right now has a sale targeted

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
like nuts right now has a sale targeted
dropping<00:01:12.180> his<00:01:12.299> pillar<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> interesting

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
dropping his pillar in a interesting

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.740 
dropping his pillar in a interesting
position<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.760> there<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.420> saw<00:01:15.570> him

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
position right there you know we saw him

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
position right there you know we saw him
drop<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> inside<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> pillars<00:01:19.939> so

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
drop it on the inside of the pillars so

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.920 
drop it on the inside of the pillars so
we'll<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.450> that's<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
we'll have to see if that's going to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.810 
we'll have to see if that's going to
play<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> factor<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
play a factor into it I think the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
play a factor into it I think the
biggest<00:01:24.030> thing<00:01:24.210> about<00:01:24.479> him<00:01:24.720> doing<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.380> he

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
biggest thing about him doing that is he

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
biggest thing about him doing that is he
realizes<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> he's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.820> need<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
realizes that he's not going to need to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
realizes that he's not going to need to
really<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.840> away<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:29.430> it'll<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> able<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
really get away as much it'll be able to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
really get away as much it'll be able to
portal<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> NLOS<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.560> his<00:01:31.680> target<00:01:32.070> yet

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
portal it was a NLOS of his target yet

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
portal it was a NLOS of his target yet
right<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.670> tenderloin<00:01:33.270> prized<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> cross

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
right so tenderloin prized the cross

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.539 
right so tenderloin prized the cross
across<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> other<00:01:34.860> side<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> map<00:01:35.520> you
