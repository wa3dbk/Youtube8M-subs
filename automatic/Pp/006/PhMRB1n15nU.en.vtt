all<00:00:04.230> right<00:00:04.410> so<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:05.580> continue<00:00:06.029> where<00:00:06.180> we<00:00:06.210> left

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
all right so to continue where we left

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.509 
all right so to continue where we left
off<00:00:06.750> with<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.230> last<00:00:07.589> video<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:09.349> three

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
off with the last video we have three

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.560 
off with the last video we have three
spheres<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> top<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.150> three<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
spheres on the top and three on the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.860 
spheres on the top and three on the
bottom<00:00:12.840> now<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.320> ones<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> top<00:00:14.009> are<00:00:14.870> very

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
bottom now the ones on the top are very

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.290 
bottom now the ones on the top are very
matte<00:00:16.289> looking<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.730> ones<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> bottom

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
matte looking and the ones on the bottom

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.500 
matte looking and the ones on the bottom
are<00:00:18.570> shiny<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.619> wanted<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> quickly<00:00:20.510> go

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
are shiny I just wanted to quickly go

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.810 
are shiny I just wanted to quickly go
over<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:22.680> difference<00:00:23.100> between<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.550> matte

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
over the difference between a matte

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.640 
over the difference between a matte
surface<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> shiny<00:00:24.720> surface<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.439> has

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
surface and the shiny surface and it has

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.400 
surface and the shiny surface and it has
to<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:27.390> contour<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.080> if<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.260> like

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
to do with the contour so if we like

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.400 
to do with the contour so if we like
zoomed<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.580> into<00:00:30.210> maybe<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.170> area

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
zoomed in way into maybe like that area

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.600 
zoomed in way into maybe like that area
of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.700> sphere<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.680> look<00:00:34.950> something

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
of the sphere it would look something

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.280 
of the sphere it would look something
like<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.280> gonna<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.700> smooth

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
like this it's not gonna be smooth

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.709 
like this it's not gonna be smooth
because<00:00:43.290> things<00:00:44.219> generally<00:00:45.180> aren't

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
because things generally aren't

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
because things generally aren't
perfectly<00:00:46.379> smooth<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> matte<00:00:47.610> surfaces

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
perfectly smooth but on a matte surfaces

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.630 
perfectly smooth but on a matte surfaces
it's<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.690> smooth<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.739> contrast<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it's not smooth at all now in contrast a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's not smooth at all now in contrast a
shiny<00:00:50.910> surface<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:52.020> smooth<00:00:52.379> still<00:00:53.219> not

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
shiny surface is more smooth still not

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.860 
shiny surface is more smooth still not
gonna<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> perfectly<00:00:54.059> smooth<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.690> still

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
gonna be perfectly smooth it's still

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.119 
gonna be perfectly smooth it's still
gonna<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.530> bumps<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
gonna have little bumps and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
gonna have little bumps and
imperfections<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.600> gonna<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.870> more

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
imperfections but it's gonna be more

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.549 
imperfections but it's gonna be more
smooth<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.309> when<00:01:00.180> light<00:01:00.750> hits<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.320> more

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
smooth and so when light hits a more

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.290 
smooth and so when light hits a more
smooth<00:01:01.920> surface<00:01:02.520> let's<00:01:02.760> say<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> lights

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
smooth surface let's say the lights

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.230 
smooth surface let's say the lights
coming<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.850> corner<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:08.670> tends<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
coming from this corner it tends to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.130 
coming from this corner it tends to
bounce<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:11.430> direction<00:01:11.900> more<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.020> less

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
bounce off in one direction more or less

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.810 
bounce off in one direction more or less
now<00:01:13.320> there's<00:01:13.500> gonna<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> some<00:01:14.100> scattering<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
now there's gonna be some scattering of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
now there's gonna be some scattering of
course<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.720> perfectly<00:01:16.200> smooth

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
course because it's not perfectly smooth

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
course because it's not perfectly smooth
but<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.610> less<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> bounce<00:01:18.299> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
but more or less it's going to bounce in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
but more or less it's going to bounce in
one<00:01:18.720> direction<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.360> gonna

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
one direction and so then you're gonna

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
one direction and so then you're gonna
get<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.200> highlights<00:01:22.890> stronger

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
get you know highlights stronger

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.350 
get you know highlights stronger
highlights<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.570> right<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.820> by<00:01:26.820> contrast

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
highlights like right there by contrast

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.590 
highlights like right there by contrast
with<00:01:27.479> matte<00:01:27.750> surfaces<00:01:29.030> there's<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.270> these

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with matte surfaces there's all these

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.420 
with matte surfaces there's all these
different<00:01:30.659> planes<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> plane<00:01:32.220> is

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
different planes see that plane is

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.179 
different planes see that plane is
facing<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.320> plane<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> facing

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
facing that way this plane is facing

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.149 
facing that way this plane is facing
that<00:01:35.400> way<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.689> one's<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.920> one's

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that way this one's that way this one's

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
that way this one's that way this one's
that<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> lights<00:01:39.360> gonna<00:01:39.509> hit<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that way so the lights gonna hit and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.399 
that way so the lights gonna hit and
then<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.470> gonna<00:01:40.619> bounce<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:42.409> different

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
then it's gonna bounce in different

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.389 
then it's gonna bounce in different
directions<00:01:44.340> depending<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.500> surface<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
directions depending on the surface it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.270 
directions depending on the surface it
hits<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:50.720> that's<00:01:51.720> why<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.040> get

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
hits right so that's why you don't get

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.420 
hits right so that's why you don't get
one<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.970> strong<00:01:54.509> highlight<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.430> things

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
one really strong highlight and things

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.399 
one really strong highlight and things
get<00:01:56.700> spread<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.149> much<00:01:57.719> more<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:59.270> if<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:01.200> want

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
get spread out much more so if you want

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.999 
get spread out much more so if you want
to<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:01.590> something<00:02:02.000> more<00:02:03.000> shiny<00:02:04.009> concentrate

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
to make something more shiny concentrate

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
to make something more shiny concentrate
the<00:02:05.159> highlight<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.939> want<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> make<00:02:06.299> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the highlight if you want to make it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.900 
the highlight if you want to make it
less<00:02:06.689> shiny<00:02:07.079> spread<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> out<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.759> more

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
less shiny spread it out more and more

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.309 
less shiny spread it out more and more
and<00:02:09.319> also<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:11.150> reflected<00:02:12.150> light<00:02:12.360> shinier

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and also with reflected light shinier

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.910 
and also with reflected light shinier
surface

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
surface

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.620 
surface
are<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.860> more<00:02:17.000> reflected-light<00:02:18.000> so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
are going to get more reflected-light so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.830 
are going to get more reflected-light so
if<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.930> wanted<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:20.120> because<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.300> smooth<00:02:21.569> right

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
if I wanted to because it's smooth right

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920 
if I wanted to because it's smooth right
so<00:02:22.020> when<00:02:22.200> light<00:02:22.410> light<00:02:22.890> bounces<00:02:23.459> off<00:02:23.930> let's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
so when light light bounces off let's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.930 
so when light light bounces off let's
say<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.319> wall<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.490> light

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
say there was a wall here and light

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.880 
say there was a wall here and light
bounces<00:02:27.390> off<00:02:27.540> well<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:27.990> got<00:02:28.200> more<00:02:28.410> chance<00:02:28.740> of

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
bounces off well it's got more chance of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.650 
bounces off well it's got more chance of
bouncing<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:29.670> hitting<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.209> again

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
bouncing and then hitting this again

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.320 
bouncing and then hitting this again
without<00:02:30.930> scattering<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:32.160> things<00:02:32.520> scatter<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
without scattering as things scatter the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.190 
without scattering as things scatter the
light<00:02:33.510> gets<00:02:33.750> more<00:02:33.959> diffused<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.990> we<00:02:36.990> could

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
light gets more diffused so we could

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.460 
light gets more diffused so we could
take<00:02:37.550> for<00:02:38.550> instance<00:02:38.880> like<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.240> red<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
take for instance like this red and it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.720 
take for instance like this red and it
could<00:02:40.680> reflect<00:02:41.010> more<00:02:41.550> into<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:43.230> blue<00:02:43.730> which

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
could reflect more into this blue which

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.770 
could reflect more into this blue which
just<00:02:45.090> heightens<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.430> shiny<00:02:47.760> feeling<00:02:48.510> of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
just heightens the the shiny feeling of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.100 
just heightens the the shiny feeling of
this<00:02:49.290> blue<00:02:49.770> sphere<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> main

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
this blue sphere so that's the main

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.640 
this blue sphere so that's the main
thing

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
thing

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
thing
matte<00:02:53.550> surfaces<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.620> more<00:02:55.620> rough<00:02:56.930> contour

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
matte surfaces have a more rough contour

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.560 
matte surfaces have a more rough contour
or<00:02:58.170> surface<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.100> them<00:02:59.250> which<00:02:59.820> scatters<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
or surface to them which scatters the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.900 
or surface to them which scatters the
light<00:03:00.600> whereas<00:03:01.170> shiny<00:03:01.580> surfaces<00:03:02.580> are<00:03:02.880> more

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
light whereas shiny surfaces are more

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.990 
light whereas shiny surfaces are more
smooth<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.440> get<00:03:04.650> extremely<00:03:05.220> smooth

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
smooth and if you get extremely smooth

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.030 
smooth and if you get extremely smooth
then<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.470> get<00:03:07.800> mirror<00:03:08.370> reflections<00:03:09.269> and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
then you get mirror reflections and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.040 
then you get mirror reflections and
