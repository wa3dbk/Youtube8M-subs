00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.139
 C'mon there started the summer and you decided 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 that turned the runner into a marathon runner is 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 This is what we see with us. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.680
 parks out there running people but 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.050
 often go wrong and end up 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.660
 health, which is why today the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.210
 people here and there are many 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.859
 bullshit in this fitness space and also 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 a professional a physical educator 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 that the pamela that will help people to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 understand a little about it about 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.860
 running on movements and also 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.680
 posture that optimize the race and yes 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.780
 make you burn fat and raze 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
 This summer teaches me how to go. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.989
 give some tips here today 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.149
 We'll give you the personal tips. 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.430
 run both on the treadmill and on the beach 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.760
 will tell you what is the highest caloric expenditure 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.350
 Everyone wants to know this , how are you? 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 run properly which is not just 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 come run the way you think you are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.239
 certain that sometimes it will end until 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.750
 injuring 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.220
 so come we always start a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 light hiking 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 I'll start here for you to start. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 slowly warming the muscles 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.270
 first you have to drop your arms 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.369
 with one of your main staff doing is 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.950
 keep the fist closed during the race 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 and sometimes very firm on top has to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.360
 leave the muscles loose 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.870
 it will be much easier after some 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.210
 Time already walked 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.000
 a minute or two, it 's possible for people 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.070
 start a race is going to be a race 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.380
 Lightweight I'm increasing for you 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.710
 little by little that I generally I have 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:44.320
 What to do and what to do seven miles by 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.680
 time the person is eating a speed 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.190
 great already to independent she is athlete if 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.190
 she is not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.670
 always look forward and never 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.790
 for the feet keeps the arm flexed to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.550
 A carefree hand is not to close the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.520
 wrist and makes a normal movement of the leg 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.140
 behind the knee up normal as if 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.270
 you were walking wanting 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.230
 lift your knee and you're going to run a lot 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.000
 easier 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.400
 your heart rate will start to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.590
 increase will start your and the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.810
 calorie then begins to me 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.120
 This is after you've already made the race. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.970
 It can also stop her from doing nothing. 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.239
 not to lose is the stimulus that you 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.709
 It has not diminished until it comes back. 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.019
 for the walk is decreasing until stopping 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.019
 It's good, then, after you 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.040
 do not stretch 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.480
 before you warm close 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.360
 always stretching 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.830
 sequence I think the cut of more 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.400
 long 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.579
 it hurts me back 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.549
 as you so sometimes it gets too much 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.650
 have to leave the musculature 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.310
 You can not let her either. 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.540
 fall 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.970
 have to keep it as if you were 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.680
 walking only a very fast speed 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 bigger 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.069
 marketing is you having a caloric expenditure 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.329
 higher on the treadmill you have to increase 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.599
 the intensity 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.609
 generally the people who run do 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.480
 that interval that is a path 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.090
 little runs a little way it's more 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.970
 optimized cold caloric expenditure because 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.069
 Are you going to change your frequency? 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.680
 heart that is what makes you burn 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.060
 calories that is different and sometimes you 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.480
 Is doing 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.989
 the month running 30 minutes 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.750
 you do after one month running to 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.000
 15 minutes only you run on the road 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.000
 And you walk there, you'll feel the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.010
 difference something now will know 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.620
 how it happened on the streets today we have 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.560
 an end and not of ashes and that in the sand 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.010
 they will speak infinite imp that run 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.310
 in the sand we spend more energy and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.020
 also left the body more is modeled fi 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.290
 sand provides this 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.959
 A society, let's not go there. 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.450
 Willing to run on the beach must have 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.370
 some care as mechanics is very 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.190
 more requested than on the treadmill that 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.750
 before it took you to run you got to 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.070
 taking care mainly of the beach is very 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.560
 determined 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.540
 If you ran the 100 you go back to 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.440
 you do not force one side more than the 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.840
 other 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.910
 and especially do not forget the sneakers 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.400
 because people sometimes thought I'm going 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.650
 running on the beach i'll run barefoot 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.780
 dangerous because of the impact it 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.430
 much larger than on the treadmill then 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.390
 that running says that even if it is 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.760
 on the beach it 's off what the burning 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.370
 on the larger beach because you do not 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.220
 has the help of the star who runs the 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.500
 your body forcing you to run the 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.620
 moment you want to have an expense 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:14.190
 calorie is greater the ball 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.190
 the size of love
