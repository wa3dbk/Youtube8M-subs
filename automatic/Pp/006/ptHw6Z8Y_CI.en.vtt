00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.610
 good morning friends this time we go 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.070
 to work some boxes where we can 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.160
 save chocolates or we can save 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.710
 gummies or we can keep the ring 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 commitment- or we can save any 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.960
 gift that you have out there 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.400
 ready and do not know where to put it here 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.919
 I'm going to teach you how to make these boxes 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.140
 that can serve us a lot and that we 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.180
 they are going to take out of many troubles are very 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.820
 easy to do simple 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.160
 materials we need are cardboard 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.780
 preferably textured so that it 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.440
 see a different touch 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.450
 we need pencil rubber paper for sheen 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.150
 and grana to make the final detail 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.200
 the furler for the filigree scissors 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.440
 a cutter the satin ribbon of course 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.480
 our molds to make the strokes 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.130
 in the boxes and good this time I 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 I'm going to put chocolatitos but the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.239
 we can fill it with what 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.640
 you prefer let's start with 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.829
 our cards I chose this one 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.050
 green color that has a lot of texture by 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.240
 one side looks like it's appearance 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.460
 of skin 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.710
 it looks very pretty we are going to use one of 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.439
 our sides the molds me here I have 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.090
 of different sizes is the size that 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.890
 you prefer to make boxes 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.490
 little girls or to make more boxes 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.250
 big I measure the base this is 3 x 3 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.979
 this is 4 x 4 and this is a 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.259
 slightly larger is 5 % so that the 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.649
 work does not come out very clean I would 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.830
 I recommend doing it with pencil with pencil 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:46.140
 let's trace 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 all around the silhouette 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 of our work and the holes for 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.110
 that my work is clean before 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.180
 start to arm 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.060
 I'm going to erase all areas where 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.490
 I considered that the pencil was marked 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.580
 so that when they open the box they do not 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.459
 note and with a cutter I'm going to help 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.880
 make the cuts that we have to make 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.569
 on the banks to hook our 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.569
 cottage 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.010
 before we start to assemble all our 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.019
 boxes we are going to do the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.220
 the decoration that we are going to put 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.079
 up with a filler for filigree 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.260
 let's take a full sheet of 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.540
 filigree me here I chose the color 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 yellow for the center I'm going to take 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.150
 some silicon in our furler 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.680
 let's place the filigree paper now 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.629
 that we have it hooked there has a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.489
 small opening and let's put there 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:54.370
 our paper and let's roll up 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.190
 holding with the thumb and we start 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.290
 to roll up this roll we're 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.900
 doing is going to be tight that is not left 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.930
 loose because it's going to be the center of 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.950
 our flower we rolled up we rolled all 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.319
 the strip since we are reaching the end 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.540
 hold and with a toothpick we will take 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.359
 a little bit of silicone and we 're going to 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.849
 place on the shore and we're going to stick there 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.000
 we have our center and we do not take it out 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.310
 right here we're going to hit a strip 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.470
 complete 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.650
 of filigree paper that is coming 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.989
 I flagged the party in three and with this 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.030
 will reach me to make three flowers and 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.640
 what we are going to do is take again 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.610
 a little bit of silicon we stick it on the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.430
 shore and we will place it in the area 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.099
 where we start where we left our 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:51.180
 pull and we do the same 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:53.730
 we wind up rolled up and at the end 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.640
 again a little touch of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.580
 silicon since we have it then we 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.220
 we took all we were going to open our 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.959
 little flower we are going to push with our 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 same roller with the back 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.290
 we are going to push the center and we have 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.290
 a little flower made 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.510
 Now what are we going to do? Let's 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.350
 start putting together our pages this is 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.350
 that we already have here lists 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.580
 they are cut out and perforated we are going to 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.920
 raise your arms in a curved shape 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.050
 let's make straight folds for 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.930
 lift in curved shape and let's 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.020
 push it down let this be 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.390
 curved and then one of the little arms that 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.529
 are drilled, we are going to lift them and 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.729
 we are going to them 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.039
 place like this 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.180
 before closing we're going to put some 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.580
 chocolates 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.860
 this is for christening memories of 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.720
 wedding on February 14 for the day 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.560
 of mothers for all the occasion we 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:04.240
 they are fabulous and we close the other 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.340
 side the ribbon that we had commented on 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.259
 a satin ribbon principle we are going to 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.479
 make a little bun and with this we are going to 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.639
 place it on our box to 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.460
 make it a little more concrete still 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.440
 we take cold silicone we put a little 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.750
 for the back and we're going to 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.530
 place on the lid that opens the one that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.570
 is up we hit it and on this 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.840
 let's put the filigree flower 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.389
 we did not put leaves 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.820
 because good with the tone of the ribbon that 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.190
 we put simulates as if they were the 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.180
 leaflets 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.610
 and we're going to put it on the bar and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.280
 ready this is not going to obstruct us for 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.720
 to be able to open our box with this 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.780
 to have all our guests 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.510
 happy and happy with a nice detail 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.390
 but if in addition to that you would like 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.630
 add some more detail they can put 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.470
 a label above with the message that 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.470
 you prefer 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:07.810
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.810
 in the next with more ideas until then 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.170
 one
