00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
you're wondering I'm doing a

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.599 
you're wondering I'm doing a
single-player<00:02:58.379> series<00:02:58.859> on<00:02:58.980> there<00:02:59.159> so<00:02:59.310> go<00:02:59.340> and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
single-player series on there so go and

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.720 
single-player series on there so go and
have<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> look<00:02:59.879> at<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:01.129> alright<00:03:02.129> then<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.400> looks

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
have a look at it alright then it looks

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.770 
have a look at it alright then it looks
like<00:03:02.909> it's<00:03:03.389> nearly<00:03:03.870> done<00:03:04.169> on<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.469> side<00:03:05.780> just

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
like it's nearly done on this side just

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.170 
like it's nearly done on this side just
loading<00:03:07.169> the<00:03:07.260> network<00:03:10.609> right<00:03:11.609> then<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.909> think

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
loading the network right then I think

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.879 
loading the network right then I think
that's<00:03:12.419> loaded<00:03:12.989> there<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.469> we're<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.650> going

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
that's loaded there so we're just going

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.149 
that's loaded there so we're just going
to<00:03:14.090> minimize<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.419> fart<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> bit<00:03:16.889> before

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
to minimize that fart for a bit before

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.000 
to minimize that fart for a bit before
you<00:03:17.609> can<00:03:17.729> see<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:17.970> down<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.799> this<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.979> a
