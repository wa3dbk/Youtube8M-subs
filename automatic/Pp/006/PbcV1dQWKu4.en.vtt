more about that in here in a minute and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.770 
more about that in here in a minute and
then<00:01:59.500> we<00:01:59.620> have<00:01:59.800> a<00:02:00.010> level<00:02:00.340> okay<00:02:01.330> let's<00:02:01.690> hear

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
then we have a level okay let's hear

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.600 
then we have a level okay let's hear

soloing<00:04:30.570> really<00:04:30.900> brings<00:04:31.110> everything<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
soloing really brings everything to the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.040 
soloing really brings everything to the
forefront<00:04:32.190> drives<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.789> tubes<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.210> lot<00:04:33.419> let's

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
forefront drives the tubes a lot let's

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.810 
forefront drives the tubes a lot let's
move<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.530> along<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:35.009> the<00:04:35.039> next<00:04:35.130> channel<00:04:35.639> here

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
move it along to the next channel here

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.520 
move it along to the next channel here
the<00:04:35.970> distortion<00:04:36.509> channel<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.050> highest<00:04:37.349> gain

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the distortion channel the highest gain

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.300 
the distortion channel the highest gain
of<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.860> three

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
of the three

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.279 
of the three
this<00:04:38.699> is<00:04:38.880> MOSFET<00:04:39.300> bass<00:04:39.449> distortion<00:04:39.660> as<00:04:40.080> well

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
this is MOSFET bass distortion as well

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.640 
this is MOSFET bass distortion as well
we've<00:04:41.220> got<00:04:41.430> distortion<00:04:42.090> knob<00:04:42.270> voice<00:04:42.990> knob<00:04:43.320> and

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
we've got distortion knob voice knob and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.860 
we've got distortion knob voice knob and
level<00:04:44.130> okay<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:44.550> distortion<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.630> amount<00:04:45.810> of

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
level okay so distortion the amount of

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.719 
level okay so distortion the amount of
distortion<00:04:46.169> in<00:04:46.470> there<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.860> level<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.639> know

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
distortion in there and level you know

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:48.409 
distortion in there and level you know
what<00:04:47.849> that<00:04:48.000> does

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
what that does

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.920 
what that does
so<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.080> voice<00:04:49.320> knob<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.759> nice<00:04:51.330> control

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
so this voice knob is a nice control

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.200 
so this voice knob is a nice control
over<00:04:52.409> the<00:04:52.740> transparency<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.520> your<00:04:53.699> tone<00:04:53.909> as

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
over the transparency of your tone as

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.290 
over the transparency of your tone as
you<00:04:55.169> turn<00:04:55.349> it<00:04:55.380> clockwise<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:56.460> get<00:04:56.639> less<00:04:56.940> gain

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
you turn it clockwise you get less gain

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.360 
you turn it clockwise you get less gain
so<00:04:57.870> if<00:04:58.260> you've<00:04:58.530> got<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.830> all<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.070> way<00:04:59.159> down

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
so if you've got this all the way down

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.540 
so if you've got this all the way down
here<00:04:59.760> it's<00:05:00.120> great<00:05:00.389> for<00:05:00.690> super<00:05:01.289> hot<00:05:01.530> solos<00:05:02.250> and

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
here it's great for super hot solos and

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.850 
here it's great for super hot solos and
if<00:05:03.060> you've<00:05:03.180> got<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.510> all<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.870> way<00:05:03.960> up<00:05:03.990> it's

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
if you've got it all the way up it's

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.700 
if you've got it all the way up it's
really<00:05:05.070> nice<00:05:05.370> for<00:05:05.400> good<00:05:06.150> clear<00:05:06.750> kind<00:05:07.590> of

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
really nice for good clear kind of

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.140 
really nice for good clear kind of
transparent<00:05:08.340> chord<00:05:08.580> crunch

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:34.380 

you

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.400 

okay<00:05:35.390> let's<00:05:35.540> bring<00:05:35.630> this<00:05:35.750> voice<00:05:35.960> all<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.200> way

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
okay let's bring this voice all the way

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.920 
okay let's bring this voice all the way
all<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:37.190> way<00:05:37.220> up<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.700> again<00:05:37.970> clockwise<00:05:38.660> is

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
all the way up and again clockwise is

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.110 
all the way up and again clockwise is
getting<00:05:39.140> us<00:05:39.260> less<00:05:39.590> gain<00:05:39.950> here<00:05:40.430> so<00:05:40.910> we're<00:05:41.030> gonna

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
getting us less gain here so we're gonna

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.690 
getting us less gain here so we're gonna
want<00:05:41.420> to<00:05:41.540> get<00:05:41.780> some<00:05:42.080> more<00:05:42.520> transparency<00:05:43.520> with

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
want to get some more transparency with

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:56.420 
want to get some more transparency with
cords<00:05:44.090> here

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.770 

distortion<00:05:57.430> channel<00:05:57.700> is<00:05:57.790> also<00:05:57.970> super<00:05:58.360> awesome

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
distortion channel is also super awesome

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.420 
distortion channel is also super awesome
because<00:05:58.900> you<00:05:59.230> can<00:05:59.470> get<00:05:59.680> your<00:05:59.860> good<00:06:00.010> hardrock

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
because you can get your good hardrock
