00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 is precisely one of the events of 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.089
 the guinea pigs not so much tomorrow is the day 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.510
 national of Cuvi but today we 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.610
 we have come to the institute of 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 agrarian research inia where 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.830
 they do all the improvement work 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.350
 genetic of guinea pigs here I present to you 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.640
 these friends are all females are 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.750
 pregnant and belong to the race called 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.010
 inti I'm here with the engineer emilia 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.660
 Chauca who is in charge of this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.759
 improvement program 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 the races as is what tomorrow will say 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.340
 celebrates the day of the cv and what is the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 importance of guinea pig 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 well I think the importance of jui 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 always has always had its space 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.879
 but today there is a recognition that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.860
 we should thank the state in this 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.250
 case to the Minister of Agriculture who 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 has already given a level to this species that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 in many cases it was not considered 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.079
 perfect and we see here for example that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 there is a very interesting part compañeras 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.140
 the guinea pigs are a breed that reproduces 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.270
 very quickly and I want to show you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.630
 some guinea pigs that have just been born today 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.360
 these strollers are born and anac 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 strollers also we already walked these 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.159
 they are fast recontra and here for example 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.770
 what do you do to them? 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.070
 putting special rings on the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.330
 ears and explain what is done here 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.380
 well really what they are doing is 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.800
 identifying the animals that just 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.259
 each group is born in each thing there is 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.569
 a parent with his group of females and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.280
 they are looking for in the morning 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.850
 who are those who were born to 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.800
 can do the identification weighing and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.840
 put all the features and 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.819
 then they are tracked 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.830
 it does not weigh him how much they weigh at weaning 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.990
 four weeks and at the time of selection 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.119
 when a guinea pig arrives to weigh 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.730
 truly be for consumption 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.340
 human and we estimate that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.160
 the animal should go to the market with 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.990
 one kilo old one kilo weight with 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.390
 kilo of pretendo how long of age 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190
 eight weeks eight weeks already 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.950
 can you eat tell me what what 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.890
 more are eaten are the males clear the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.650
 males are the ones that are needed less 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.680
 for multiplication then the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.890
 females use them to replace other 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.990
 schools and males are selected 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.090
 only the best the transfer have 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.260
 to go out to the market of course yes now 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.970
 Did you know that compañeras that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.820
 there are also guinea pigs that serve to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.980
 pets but for example these are not these 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.910
 they eat they know what is for pets 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.910
 this one here 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.230
 is that it is long hair and it generates to see 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 explain about the characteristics of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.040
 this neck that is for greater these 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.990
 culés have a characteristic that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 may have been generated by mutation 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.670
 it's like the angora rabbits 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 of long hair these are the guinea pigs 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.680
 long hair 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.959
 the hair quality is not very good but 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.830
 They are very nice to have them as 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.680
 companion animal 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.420
 hunter if I hear you how beneficial 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.110
 is the consumption of fire in relation to 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.510
 other meats good the protein of the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.940
 guinea pig meat is excellent not only for the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.730
 high level of your meat but because 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.319
 they have an excellent amino gram these 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.750
 works were done by the doctor 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.360
 before May one what he left well 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.630
 that as a native species they had 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.540
 them a better quality and amino acids 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.840
 now compañeras I will tell you that the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.970
 Peru is already exporting cuyes though 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.819
 You do not believe it, the doctor told me 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.870
 that there are guinea pigs all over the world but 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.900
 the guinea pigs that are eaten exist in countries 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.780
 Andean countries such as Ecuador and Colombia 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.989
 and to Colombia they are going to be few 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.970
 Well, these days the column has sold 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.770
 50 percent reproducers 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.880
 sorry 500 players 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.030
 of which we are going we will send 150 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.520
 because only by capacity in the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.860
 aircraft cabins that should be 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.260
 because they are going to travel by air 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.240
 riches that are those that we have sent 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280
 in what later on we have 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.950
 prepared we are the interracial that is 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.900
 what are the synthetic lines for a 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.510
 so much so that I go to one more animal 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.090
 tough because these go to dinner and 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.120
 they will play after being delivered 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.120
 to the communities of colombia now
