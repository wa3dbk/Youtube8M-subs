00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
pretty much the ejecta this is you gotta

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.920 
pretty much the ejecta this is you gotta
get<00:00:35.980> this<00:00:36.129> block<00:00:36.430> right<00:00:36.699> here<00:00:37.059> this<00:00:37.510> one<00:00:37.690> into

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930
