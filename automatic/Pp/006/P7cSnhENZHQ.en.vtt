these<00:00:17.250> trucks<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:17.670> everything<00:00:18.090> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
these trucks now everything is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.609 
these trucks now everything is
electronic<00:00:18.390> controlled<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.380> know<00:00:19.470> they

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
electronic controlled you know they

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.109 
electronic controlled you know they
would<00:00:19.740> last<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.279> month<00:00:20.400> without<00:00:20.820> us

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119

maintaining<00:00:21.689> him<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> got<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
maintaining him now you got to have a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.950 
maintaining him now you got to have a
computer<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.369> hook<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> these<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.510> diagnose

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
computer to hook up to these to diagnose

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
computer to hook up to these to diagnose
them<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.980> than<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.189> changing

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
them so it's more than just changing

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.540 
them so it's more than just changing
