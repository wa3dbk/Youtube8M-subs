we're going to torque that to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.140 
we're going to torque that to
approximately<00:03:07.160> 18<00:03:07.670> pounds<00:03:09.010> foot-pounds

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150

there's the oil filter cover and go

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.199 
there's the oil filter cover and go
ahead<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:21.860> remove<00:03:22.160> that

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.289

filter was mounted onto the cover go

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.920 
filter was mounted onto the cover go
ahead<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.760> replace<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.269> with<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.569> high

what we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.140 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:04:49.190> ahead<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.980> run<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.100> bike<00:04:52.280> for<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.670> few

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
go ahead and run the bike for a few

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:03.010 
go ahead and run the bike for a few
minutes

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.119 

now<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.199> we've<00:05:04.319> round<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.680> bike<00:05:04.830> we're

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
now that we've round the bike we're

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.540 
now that we've round the bike we're
going<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.310> check<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.360> oil<00:05:06.389> level<00:05:06.949> and<00:05:07.949> you

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
going to check the oil level and you

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.510 
going to check the oil level and you
unthread<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:10.520> dipstick<00:05:11.520> clean<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.449> off<00:05:12.629> and

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
unthread the dipstick clean it off and

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.100 
unthread the dipstick clean it off and
then<00:05:14.520> set<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.090> back<00:05:15.330> in<00:05:15.569> the<00:05:15.659> hole<00:05:15.840> without

and<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.610> how<00:05:21.730> you<00:05:21.790> get<00:05:21.970> your<00:05:22.090> correct<00:05:22.510> oil

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and this is how you get your correct oil

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.390 
and this is how you get your correct oil
