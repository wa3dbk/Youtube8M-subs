00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.120 
again what's cool about this is that the
ice<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:30.750> am<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.290> soft<00:01:31.560> pencil<00:01:31.710> it's

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
ice is actually am a soft pencil it's

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.760 
ice is actually am a soft pencil it's
like<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.370> picture<00:01:32.940> pieces<00:01:33.480> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> ice<00:01:33.870> so<00:01:34.620> I'm

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
like a picture pieces of the ice so I'm

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830 
like a picture pieces of the ice so I'm
actually<00:01:35.040> looking<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:36.000> accurate<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
actually looking more accurate to the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.090 
actually looking more accurate to the
character<00:01:37.470> from<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.710> game

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
character from the game

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.250 
character from the game
there's<00:01:38.430> no<00:01:38.550> one<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.760> here<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.570> her<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> kind

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
there's no one right here to her a kind

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.320 
there's no one right here to her a kind
of<00:01:40.320> total<00:01:40.860> body<00:01:41.010> air<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
of total body air you can see the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.000

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.640 
different camp outfit it's quite a
drastic<00:01:44.790> change<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.150> think<00:01:45.230> from<00:01:46.230> a<00:01:46.350> fantasy
