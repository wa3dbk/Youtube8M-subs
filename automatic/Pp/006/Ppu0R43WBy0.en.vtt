00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
Pokemon you want to battle up slowpoke

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.550 
Pokemon you want to battle up slowpoke
is<00:02:59.640> at<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> front<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.120> your<00:03:00.180> party<00:03:00.599> because

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
is at the front of your party because

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.680 
is at the front of your party because
otherwise<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.610> could<00:03:02.819> like<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.299> lose<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
otherwise you could like you lose the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.120 
otherwise you could like you lose the
battle<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.140> don't<00:03:04.319> know<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.590> resets<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
battle I don't know if that resets the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.500 
battle I don't know if that resets the
glitch<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.580> does<00:03:05.819> reset<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.239> glitch<00:03:06.390> I'm

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
glitch if it does reset the glitch I'm

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.910 
glitch if it does reset the glitch I'm
pretty<00:03:06.840> sure<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.049> could<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.530> again

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
pretty sure you could just do it again

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.740 
pretty sure you could just do it again
so<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.849> doesn't<00:03:09.060> even<00:03:09.150> matter<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> lose

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
so it doesn't even matter if you lose

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.199 
so it doesn't even matter if you lose
the<00:03:09.930> battle<00:03:10.110> or<00:03:10.260> not

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
the battle or not

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.120 
the battle or not
so<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.330> defeat<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.720> guy<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.560> youngster<00:03:14.010> who

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
so we defeat that guy that youngster who

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.380 
so we defeat that guy that youngster who
doesn't<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> name<00:03:14.730> we're<00:03:14.970> gonna<00:03:15.090> call<00:03:15.269> him
