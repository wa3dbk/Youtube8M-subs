00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.130
 that was playing around there a low 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.810

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.649

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.680
 pretty good test I'll take you with 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.510
 muffler and advantages good I always 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.829
 game I think I took to see I think 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.979
 that he was wearing hard line wearing line 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.940
 tough vest in the greens wore the 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:53.949
 muscle and and scavenger and in the red ones 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.229
 I carried practical magic if not bad 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.839
 I remember if he wore the technical mask and 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.460
 well, guys, I'm super excited 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.219
 I've seen a lot of gameplays 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.159
 many youtubers that are dedicated to call 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.960
 of duty, they had the opportunity to go 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.469
 to the gamescom 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.840
 from gamescom and from 3 they started 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.939
 to record many gameplay in the USA to their 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.439
 channels and I 've been watching them 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.380
 you know what julia color and it's a 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.959
 game that I like but then at 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 principle, not many of you 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:29.390
 you know that I started playing halo 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.869
 I was a halo fan boy a halo a boy 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.760
 hello know in first version suter was 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.100
 the combative halo of halo 1 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.080
 but honestly then good then 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.280
 I played halo 2 so I did not play the gel 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.840
 or not when it came out eye I played it on 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.790
 computer already afterwards when I was 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.410
 a little adolescent now is that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 right now it's very, very, very big 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.390
 good but good I played it a couple of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.720
 years nothing becomes a barÃ§a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 a few years ago no and then 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.730
 Well, I had a lot of fun with hello and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.000
 all this and play the one was first 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.040
 2 or 3 halo then I played after 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.680
 4 the gel or four toys as the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.240
 first halo in console was the halo reach 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.710
 but well let's stop talking about 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.350
 hey what here we are with an old man 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.360
 let yuri we are not with hello but yes 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.550
 then I liked that very much 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.700
 game but then I saw good thanks to 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.950
 other youtubers that I see often met 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.870
 this great game with yuri and the truth is 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.370
 Good thing, I saw it, it's cool 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.500
 no and I also played the gel call of duty 4 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.780
 on my computer I started playing there 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.250
 but good and I met my first comic 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.860
 in console was the call of duty black 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.299
 ops' 2 and from that moment I 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.580
 loved this I think my favorite color 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.560
 It is not approved because many go but 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.310
 those that I have tried and all that 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 I've seen better and white 2 is one of my 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.530
 favorite games besides my destiny 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.989
 so many of you follow me in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.430
 the channel just for dressing and it gives me 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.720
 very much taste because destiny is a 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.209
 great game is a pretty game 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.829
 fun that excites and hate I would say 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.319
 which is best preferred in the destination 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.400
 but my color and I love it and the white 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.799
 they are more like trailer games 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 then I am very excited very 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.310
 aerated as you who besides playing 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.379
 the black ops three noble three that will be 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.709
 leaving in November of this year to the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.989
 beta I do not think I can play it more than anything 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.030
 for economic reasons then 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.190
 I hope to buy the cause 3 and 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.419
 to play it and upload it to the channel that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.950
 I hope that you guys will also 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.850
 like judy if it's not like that there's no 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 no problem 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.970
 I will be uploading others uploading something 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.410
 of ice to the channel but it will be in gameplays 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.690
 very sporadically they are not going to do 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.120
 gameplays so he has put the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.980
 Friday are the honor or not and so with 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 Said he said to follow he usually climb the channel 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.280
 a little more often in this same and 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.250
 priority I love you film kim 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.140
 kim I see it awesome wow I think 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.480
 I will like very much me off 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.670
 a lot of time is what I do not like but 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.960
 it's going to be a great game and so the white 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.240
 is the one that 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.870
 so I can tell you 3 whites 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.080
 seen gameplays and everything and believe me that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.820
 I mean it looks like many whites 2 do not 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.300
 they have the classic jumps of the advance 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.890
 warfare that becomes a vertical combat 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.780
 instead of a horizontal combat it is not no 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.030
 you go to the map but it goes jumping and between 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.500
 you jump you kill that I do not like at all and 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.500
 I 've seen it from the little jumps in the black 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.350
 ops 3 is that it's more like a little jump 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.090
 Halter style of the jumping one 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.350
 it's little but it's somewhat limited 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.110
 then nothing else is like to go 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.420
 jumping towards structures trim 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.730
 spaces and so on is not to be that 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.240
 you jump and if you miss us well you do not kill that 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.639
 is what 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.110
 I like black ops 3 and I hope so 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.120
 try the guys I hope to buy it 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.590
 for when it comes out and good to play for 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.940
 percent this example was there is 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.949
 recorded cinema mode so see 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.630
 some half- rare deaths so the 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.759
 Streak took it out because they do not look good 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.110
 with when it rises like in real time but 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.910
 guys that's been all my comment 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.650
 I hope you liked it, stop here 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.720
 down in the comment box its 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.849
 opinion what is your color want 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.190
 preferred according to the purchase of black ops 3 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.430
 hemorrhagic many times because of him there is 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.009
 share it that helps the channel very much 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:21.520
 as he does not have an idea and see you in the 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.520
 next video see you soon guys
