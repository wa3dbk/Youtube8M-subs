00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.150
 what 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.159
 not 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.500
 hello gentlemen you are cute but no name 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.360
 r - that when I lose help 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.250
 and that the trends of the year for chrysanthemums 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
 we notice a trend is all the colors we have autumnal colors 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 so in orange tones in holiday camps 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 dubai laurent white rose and they wanted regret the pure white rose 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.609
 of all the colors so it may be necessary to add caroline is that 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.920
 for chrysanthemums it is of course used to bloom the graves with 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.299
 scc very well it's the flower of the memory must not forget also that 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.620
 16 7 m flowers that allow 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.110
 to still have a garden of their own which is very pleasant since one can 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.740
 use it to tell you in the garden but even on a terrace or balcony 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.410
 put a nice potter like that it brings a higher to leave some 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.300
 varieties that went after ten sometimes to the first freezes of holdings 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.700
 and who animated an employee of the great controversy him that the big boots 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.120
 past years in varieties that will know that they are 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.040
 very resistant there is still a little thing in general on November 1 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.259
 serrar when we were small a charles duster it's been a long time 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.180
 black who had stripped had lunch% at all that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 announced later in the calm and if we created this debate just the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.359
 ask for that 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.619
 to put a newspaper you can spread two sheets of newspaper the newspaper is 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.989
 refusing tons it protects the thawed you remove it again the 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:42.380
 morning what I also wanted to say compared to the big chrysanthemums 

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.940
 flowers 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.640
 an internal crisis a big fear is that it's the chrysanthemum king for 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.380
 put for example on a tandem bathes in a majesty cc entry and that's 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.360
 difficult to compare the two and that's also a matter of taste but I 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.250
 find that a chrysanthemum that is the expense of the protesters we do not know when 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.820
 even it was night walk on the edge of business has sacred evening in 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.100
 anyway not the chrysanthemums that looks like I find it is small 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.340
 daisy it's true that it's always useful 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.769
 but basin was saying well 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.120
 antennas is the bar eric dubois then we finally like this dec 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.099
 maintenance image and the chrysanthemum we leave a little of course of them 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.549
 cemeteries to go higher and higher in the gardens 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.220
 persistent very soon 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.290
 for the latecomers 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.500
 no to those who are struggling to jérémy amelin not should not be afraid of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 la France 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.399
 we celebrate with britain who fills us homes and vacations 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.749
 this summer and still blooming there would be strong first time that 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.199
 first to direct effects it may still be necessary to take advantage of 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.900
 you know you can re-enter even in a temperate room you the 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.839
 put your finger on the window and then you will enjoy caroline again to do 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.820
 finally not really because all sides 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.580
 to show how to store elsewhere 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.410
 you have to know the ivory geraniums so the Ottoman geraniums is very 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.150
 very very difficult to keep from one year to the next to keep the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.760
 young people are entitled the annals as they are called saleh no problem you 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.840
 can keep them in a light-filled room without forgetting the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.210
 water do not forget to water them from time to time in winter so go 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.030
 shorten harbors to his jailers for the holidays doing 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.680
 unblock 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.840
 so we're going to cut the stems a little bit so it's not about storing them like 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.729
 it would not matter but finally 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.459
 it was useless the flowers will dry the leaves 6 so we go 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.350
 listen 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.440
 it's a lot easier to store ben yes you can keep them and make 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.839
 a small bouquet 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.349
 so we will unfortunately all deleted here but I rabeats them in 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.639
 favor of the ideal temperature for this winter mostly throwing 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.799
 angels that's all good - if you put them in quarts the ditch skier from the 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.650
 light because otherwise they will tend 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.500
 to fend off it's one of the winter to my mom 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.480
 and enough that he was going to give in to make stems three fragile hotels is 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.820
 all white we call that kill them mans so there we go cut 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.520
 downright here the league cup if I see it then there it is almost 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.400
 foot he had been a little eaten by unheard of caterpillar outside he served 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.770
 two passes yes exactly so we can remove if we want the leaves that 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.870
 are damaged in others that will come alive during the winter so do not forget 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.870
 not you put it like that in the local and it will be necessary not to maintain 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.950
 the moist potting soil crumbs from time to time ie once every 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.940
 three weeks to give you some salt water to help maintain 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.640
 alive and then in spring it will restart we can copy it from 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.849
 new at that time that means it will develop more of 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.580
 branch and this more on the branch more on a floret that's what it 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.749
 implies here we made an observation yes yes absolutely oermingen pastore chaos
