all<00:00:01.829> right<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:02.730> massive<00:00:03.419> argon<00:00:03.990> gas<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.980> 75

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
all right so massive argon gas and 75

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
all right so massive argon gas and 75

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
gas law problem you see gas that's in

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
gas law problem you see gas that's in
one<00:00:15.360> clue<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.230> other<00:00:16.320> clue<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.890> see<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
one clue the other clue is you see the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.640 
one clue the other clue is you see the
words<00:00:17.310> STP<00:00:18.000> usually<00:00:18.660> indicates<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> gas<00:00:19.380> law

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650

problem<00:00:21.560> you<00:00:22.560> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> ask<00:00:23.010> yourself<00:00:23.519> is

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
problem you want to ask yourself is

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.480 
problem you want to ask yourself is
there<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.970> change<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> does<00:00:26.039> anything<00:00:26.279> change

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
there a change but does anything change

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.390 
there a change but does anything change
yeah<00:00:27.150> that's<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.539> key<00:00:27.810> question<00:00:28.400> volume

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
yeah that's your key question volume

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
yeah that's your key question volume
change<00:00:29.789> pressure<00:00:30.330> change<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:31.080> don't<00:00:31.109> see

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
change pressure change they don't see

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.030 
change pressure change they don't see
anything<00:00:31.820> it's<00:00:32.820> constant<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.200> there's<00:00:34.440> if

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
anything it's constant so there's if

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
anything it's constant so there's if
there<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.489> change<00:00:35.969> I'd<00:00:36.149> go<00:00:36.300> combine<00:00:36.719> against

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
there was change I'd go combine against

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
there was change I'd go combine against
line<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.500> there's<00:00:37.739> no<00:00:38.070> change<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.149> want<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
line if there's no change do you want to

pressure problem because there's only
one<00:00:44.100> gas<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.180> can't<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.420> partial<00:00:45.809> pressure

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
one gas so it can't be partial pressure

know<00:00:52.079> gram<00:00:52.440> flaw<00:00:52.770> possible<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.239> only<00:00:54.629> thing

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
know gram flaw possible so only thing

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.020 
know gram flaw possible so only thing
possible<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.379> feel<00:00:55.590> guess<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.730> we'll<00:00:56.879> go

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
possible is I feel guess one so we'll go

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
possible is I feel guess one so we'll go

milliliters or 0.075 liters
what<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> using<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.729> ideal<00:01:11.939> gas<00:01:12.000> law<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
what are you using the ideal gas law you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
what are you using the ideal gas law you
want<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> volume<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.380> liters

want the volume in liters

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.719 
want the volume in liters
we'll<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.840> our<00:01:16.080> we've<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:18.350> 0.08206

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
we'll do our we've got that one 0.08206

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.810 
we'll do our we've got that one 0.08206
liters<00:01:20.729> atmospheres<00:01:21.530> per<00:01:22.530> mole<00:01:25.520> okay<00:01:26.520> that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
liters atmospheres per mole okay that's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.990 
liters atmospheres per mole okay that's
good<00:01:27.530> temperature<00:01:28.640> well<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
good temperature well you have the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.319 
good temperature well you have the
temperature<00:01:30.420> hidden<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.900> STP<00:01:32.180> what's<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
temperature hidden in STP what's the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.090 
temperature hidden in STP what's the
temperature<00:01:33.659> st<00:01:34.970> 0<00:01:35.970> Celsius<00:01:36.470> which<00:01:37.470> equals

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
temperature st 0 Celsius which equals

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.250 
temperature st 0 Celsius which equals
yeah<00:01:39.640> well<00:01:42.150> we'll<00:01:43.150> be<00:01:43.270> really<00:01:43.479> fancy<00:01:43.810> him<00:01:44.110> for

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
yeah well we'll be really fancy him for

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.940 
yeah well we'll be really fancy him for
all<00:01:44.409> five<00:01:44.650> decimals<00:01:45.250> down<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.650> can<00:01:47.800> just

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
all five decimals down but you can just

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.870 
all five decimals down but you can just
put<00:01:48.130> 273<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.030> me<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:49.300> doesn't<00:01:49.479> matter<00:01:50.880> because

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
put 273 to me it doesn't matter because

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.400 
put 273 to me it doesn't matter because
see<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:52.570> one<00:01:52.810> only<00:01:53.170> has<00:01:53.290> 3<00:01:53.740> sig<00:01:53.979> figs<00:01:54.030> 275<00:01:55.410> so

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
see this one only has 3 sig figs 275 so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.490 
see this one only has 3 sig figs 275 so
you<00:01:56.470> really<00:01:57.100> only<00:01:57.130> need<00:01:57.900> 3<00:01:58.900> or<00:01:58.930> if<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.320> want<00:01:59.470> to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
you really only need 3 or if you want to

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.640 
you really only need 3 or if you want to
put<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.740> fourth<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.460> -<00:02:00.700> okay<00:02:01.660> that's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.130 

tp1<00:02:05.650> atm<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.340> got<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.750> need<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.020> know

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
tp1 atm you got that you need to know

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.550 
tp1 atm you got that you need to know
STP<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:09.100> need<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.429> know<00:02:09.580> what<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:09.759> means

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
STP you need to know what that means

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.420 
STP you need to know what that means
okay<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> heck<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.959> want<00:02:14.590> mass<00:02:17.430> you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
okay and what the heck I want mass you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.670 
okay and what the heck I want mass you
got<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.300> I'm<00:02:19.600> just<00:02:19.660> gonna<00:02:19.959> solve<00:02:20.320> her<00:02:20.470> end

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
got it so I'm just gonna solve her end

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.190 
got it so I'm just gonna solve her end
right<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.570> convert<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:22.989> mass

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
right now and then convert it to mass

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.229 
right now and then convert it to mass
and<00:02:23.680> there's<00:02:24.640> my<00:02:24.820> problem

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
and there's my problem

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.920 
and there's my problem
so<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.230> PV<00:02:26.860> over<00:02:27.160> RT<00:02:28.470> p<00:02:29.470> 1<00:02:30.130> atmosphere<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
so it's PV over RT p 1 atmosphere the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.240 
so it's PV over RT p 1 atmosphere the
volume<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:33.060> 0.075<00:02:34.060> 0<00:02:34.630> meters<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:36.720> point<00:02:37.720> 0<00:02:38.019> 8<00:02:38.440> -

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
volume is 0.075 0 meters on point 0 8 -

times<00:02:45.940> T<00:02:46.440> 273<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.989> then<00:02:50.640> after<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.760> get<00:02:51.940> this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
times T 273 and then after you get this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.240 
times T 273 and then after you get this
number<00:02:52.269> whatever<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.500> you're<00:02:54.130> gonna

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
number whatever that is you're gonna

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.060 
number whatever that is you're gonna
take<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.900> multiply<00:02:58.900> by<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.620> molar<00:02:59.890> mass

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
take this and multiply by the molar mass

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.280 
take this and multiply by the molar mass
to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.820> grams<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:03.100> T<00:03:03.310> well<00:03:04.079> since<00:03:05.079> we're

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
to get grams for T well since we're

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.789 
to get grams for T well since we're
being<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:05.769> four<00:03:06.160> sides<00:03:06.400> above<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.140> 39.95<00:03:08.140> but

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
being all four sides above the 39.95 but

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.240 
being all four sides above the 39.95 but
normally<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.280> just<00:03:09.370> use<00:03:09.610> 40<00:03:10.860> grams<00:03:11.860> per<00:03:12.130> mole

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
normally I just use 40 grams per mole

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.870 
normally I just use 40 grams per mole
and<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.630> convert<00:03:13.959> moles<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.500> grams<00:03:14.880> is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
and that will convert moles to grams is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.750 
and that will convert moles to grams is
that<00:03:16.060> okay<00:03:16.269> for<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.480> first<00:03:16.630> one
