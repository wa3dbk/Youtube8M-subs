00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
a chance and they can all beat the Elite

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.920 
a chance and they can all beat the Elite
Four<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.800> let's<00:00:38.280> start<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.610> Sydney<00:00:39.180> he's<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
Four so let's start with Sydney he's the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.200 
Four so let's start with Sydney he's the
master<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> dark<00:00:40.649> type<00:00:40.860> Pokemon<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.730> don't

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
master of dark type Pokemon and I don't

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760 
master of dark type Pokemon and I don't
have<00:00:42.360> any<00:00:42.540> fighting-type<00:00:43.079> moves<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.739> anything

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
have any fighting-type moves or anything

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.029 
have any fighting-type moves or anything
so<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:45.210> probably<00:00:45.600> shouldn't<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.800> easy

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
so it's probably shouldn't be that easy

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
so it's probably shouldn't be that easy
but<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:48.329> should<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> good<00:00:48.899> challenge<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
but it should be a good challenge so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.520 
but it should be a good challenge so

non attacking move it just doesn't make
sense

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590

so that's good so double-team again and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.660 
so that's good so double-team again and
luckily<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.500> fly<00:03:27.860> on<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.250> thing<00:03:28.489> which

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
luckily I have fly on this thing which

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.810 
luckily I have fly on this thing which
um<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.720> super<00:03:30.049> effective<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:30.860> I'm<00:03:31.670> actually

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
um is super effective so I'm actually

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.039 
um is super effective so I'm actually
not<00:03:32.030> going<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.329> do<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.630> though<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:32.900> want

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
not going to do that though I just want

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.560 
not going to do that though I just want
to<00:03:33.260> confuse<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.890> thing<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:34.310> because<00:03:34.610> like

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
to confuse the thing just because like

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.539 
to confuse the thing just because like
my<00:03:35.780> fly<00:03:36.079> still<00:03:36.440> isn't<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.799> powerful<00:03:37.370> because

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
my fly still isn't that powerful because

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.660 
my fly still isn't that powerful because
pelipper<00:03:38.180> has<00:03:38.299> like<00:03:38.480> base<00:03:38.720> 50<00:03:39.320> attack<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.070> we

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
pelipper has like base 50 attack but we

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.130 
pelipper has like base 50 attack but we
have<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.880> do<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.120> eventually<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.570> guess<00:03:41.870> we

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
have to do it eventually I guess we

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.380 
have to do it eventually I guess we
might<00:03:42.350> as<00:03:42.440> well<00:03:42.470> now<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.730> since<00:03:44.209> it's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
might as well now and since it's

really be a pain if it uses it like
three<00:04:35.770> times<00:04:36.100> but<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:36.940> don't<00:04:37.510> think<00:04:37.810> it's

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
three times but I don't think it's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.390 
three times but I don't think it's
really<00:04:38.170> gonna<00:04:38.260> matter<00:04:38.470> because<00:04:38.800> hustle<00:04:39.280> out

really gonna matter because hustle out

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.370 
really gonna matter because hustle out
squeezes<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.060> thing<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.600> another<00:04:40.930> Thunder

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
should knock it out where I guess

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.270 
should knock it out where I guess
Thunderbolt<00:04:44.050> would<00:04:44.380> still<00:04:44.800> do<00:04:44.920> it<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.160> let's

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
just because I can probably use fly on

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.000 
just because I can probably use fly on
it<00:05:03.520> or<00:05:03.669> something<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.210> don't<00:05:04.600> know<00:05:04.750> so<00:05:05.590> let's

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
it or something I don't know so let's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.460 
it or something I don't know so let's
see<00:05:06.750> levels<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.930> thing<00:05:08.140> in<00:05:09.780> 46<00:05:10.780> now<00:05:11.020> this

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
see levels this thing in 46 now this

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.650 
see levels this thing in 46 now this
thing<00:05:11.650> also<00:05:11.830> doesn't<00:05:12.220> have<00:05:12.340> too<00:05:13.030> many<00:05:13.150> super

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
thing also doesn't have too many super

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.780 
thing also doesn't have too many super
high<00:05:14.110> miss<00:05:14.470> darn<00:05:14.830> yeah<00:05:15.220> this<00:05:15.370> thing<00:05:15.490> is<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.669> have

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
high miss darn yeah this thing is I have

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.520 
high miss darn yeah this thing is I have
too<00:05:16.000> many<00:05:16.090> super<00:05:16.570> powerful<00:05:16.870> attacks<00:05:17.290> I<00:05:17.500> think

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
too many super powerful attacks I think

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.800 
too many super powerful attacks I think
it<00:05:17.740> knows<00:05:17.860> like<00:05:18.010> needle<00:05:18.460> arm<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:18.970> maybe<00:05:19.450> faint

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
it knows like needle arm and maybe faint

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.210 
it knows like needle arm and maybe faint
attack<00:05:20.110> but<00:05:20.350> other<00:05:20.560> than<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:21.040> can't

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
attack but other than that it can't

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.310 
attack but other than that it can't
really<00:05:21.340> do<00:05:21.520> too<00:05:21.820> much<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.510> so<00:05:23.169> I'm<00:05:23.290> just

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
really do too much to you so I'm just

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.100 
really do too much to you so I'm just
gonna<00:05:23.500> try<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.270> confuse<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.450> thing<00:05:25.630> so<00:05:25.990> it

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
gonna try to confuse the thing so it

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.640 
gonna try to confuse the thing so it
hits<00:05:26.320> itself<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.800> few<00:05:26.950> times<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:28.330> yeah<00:05:28.810> so

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
hits itself a few times and yeah so

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.770 
hits itself a few times and yeah so
there<00:05:30.220> we<00:05:30.340> go<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.730> I<00:05:31.180> should<00:05:31.330> probably<00:05:31.419> heal

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
there we go and I should probably heal

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.140 
there we go and I should probably heal
after<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:32.200> faint<00:05:32.410> attack<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:35.790> but<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:37.000> could

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
after that faint attack so but I could

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.310 
after that faint attack so but I could
probably<00:05:37.300> just<00:05:37.480> do<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.660> after<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.020> battle

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
probably just do it after the battle

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.790 
probably just do it after the battle
which<00:05:39.160> is<00:05:39.190> fine<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:40.450> needle<00:05:40.840> arm<00:05:40.960> again<00:05:41.470> and

which is fine so needle arm again and

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.970 
which is fine so needle arm again and
then<00:05:42.960> darn<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.110> should've<00:05:44.140> just<00:05:44.440> heal<00:05:44.710> bright
