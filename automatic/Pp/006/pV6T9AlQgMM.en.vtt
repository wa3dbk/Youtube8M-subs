00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.369
 hello again I'm arturo since we're 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.009
 to do another video tutorial in this 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.779
 case concerning the iceberg model 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.050
 Well, just to give some small 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 brush strokes on some previous occasion 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.640
 we have dealt with the wheel of life and a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.439
 very simply we have established a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 series of objectives in a period of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.660
 determined time we have also seen 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.680
 some of the techniques to facilitate 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.890
 the achievement of objectives such as 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 smart but today we are going to work 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.070
 with the model of the iceberg the iceberg 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.830
 all semis in mind and you have gone 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 repeated times only points towards 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.830
 out or out from sea level 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.720
 it's a small part compared to 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.270
 what is below 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.220
 when we and here is the key that 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.820
 we need to go if trying fijaros 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.370
 we have the theme of the truth of life 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.700
 in Bolivia 24 targets that stay in 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.090
 three and that those three can be specified 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 in one that would be the axis of that of that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.420
 world for that year or for that period of 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.880
 particular time but it usually happens 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.540
 that when we are we said when 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.540
 we act more 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.430
 spontaneously or without thinking too much or 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.230
 of what we are aware of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.080
 they always appear the same 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.390
 objectives or almost always or very similar 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.160
 variations of them however what 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.470
 we try to do with the model of 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.630
 enneagram is to realize that what 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.050
 fundamental what is really important 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.810
 it is not within the reach of each day not what 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.729
 we are so clear and it is the difference 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.220
 with which we have to go deeper 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.280
 down you go to those depths 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.010
 those under water so there 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 to feel intimately and in there 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.140
 under the water in the unconscious it 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.479
 I could say in the lunar also for 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.239
 another kind of language there is our 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.510
 view our true purpose by 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.489
 so it's not obvious and you have to dive 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.940
 in the privacy within us 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.520
 same to rediscover what to be 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.840
 is with which it would be about 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 wreck it 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.980
 from outside those who think that 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.660
 they are going to say what is their goal what is 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.290
 your purpose in life what is your 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.300
 mission they have it clear they are not going to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.190
 say and if we pay attention to those sources 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.250
 externally we will fall into certain 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.400
 dependencies from which it is better to forget 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.470
 whereby 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.930
 we have to think with this model with 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.510
 the model of the iceberg that we're going to go to 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.550
 dive in the most intimate of us to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 so to find 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.930
 then it would be find our own 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.300
 view our own purpose our 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.150
 own purpose of life vocation 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.460
 also our ambition in the company 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.040
 we are used to working with the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.610
 mission preserve the preponderant role 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.510
 that we have in that development of the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.640
 view 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.519
 it is not what precisely the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.519
 card this I say many times and 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.010
 It sounds like it is very easy but not 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.379
 is a hierarchical identification the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.120
 identification in view of others what 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.519
 what it's about is looking for that role 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.069
 fundamental in our life and then 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.890
 also find what the values ​​are 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.560
 the guiding values ​​the values ​​that the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.750
 company also have another name that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.849
 be the motivators what we 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.579
 starts up that puts us in motion 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.489
 so that precisely for 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.359
 get up every morning wearing the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.370
 paper or vision that we have to 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:00.239
 play to achieve that purpose 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.310
 or vision of the company and in this case 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.980
 also from our own company 's 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.329
 we leave it here and continue in 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.329
 another video thanks 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.330
 yes
