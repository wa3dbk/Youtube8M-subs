00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
i'm going to say right now i don't the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.770 
i'm going to say right now i don't the
two<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.010> compare<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.489> these<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.540> like

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
two to compare but these have this like

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.020 
two to compare but these have this like
nice<00:03:39.959> padded<00:03:40.440> collar<00:03:40.650> some<00:03:41.579> of<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.700> basics

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
nice padded collar some of the basics

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.759 
nice padded collar some of the basics
also<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.420> collar<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.049> in<00:03:43.320> terms<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
also have the collar but in terms of the

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.130 
also have the collar but in terms of the
fit<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:44.489> way<00:03:44.760> thicker<00:03:45.150> there's<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.109> lot

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
fit it's just way thicker there's a lot

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.370 
fit it's just way thicker there's a lot
more<00:03:46.380> insulation<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:48.060> build<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.170> much

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
more insulation the build is so much

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.680 
more insulation the build is so much
better<00:03:49.560> don't<00:03:50.220> need<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.579> guess<00:03:50.880> drawback<00:03:51.390> block

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
better don't need I guess drawback block

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.420 
better don't need I guess drawback block
considerate<00:03:52.109> one<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.890> these<00:03:53.010> are<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> lot

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
considerate one is that these are a lot

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.910 
considerate one is that these are a lot
heavier<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.150> don't<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:54.780> that's<00:03:55.590> not<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.829> big

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
heavier I don't know that's not a big

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.360 
heavier I don't know that's not a big
deal<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.160> me<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.870> maybe<00:03:57.870> some<00:03:58.170> people<00:03:58.470> will

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
deal to me but maybe some people will

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.319 
deal to me but maybe some people will
find<00:03:59.609> that<00:04:00.140> like<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.200> drawback<00:04:01.709> right<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:02.609> now

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
find that like a drawback right here now
