00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.279 
oh no oh Wilson what have you done oh
it's<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.520> second<00:05:28.970> yellow<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.630> red<00:05:29.660> damn

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
it but I take it it's better than

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:40.530 
it but I take it it's better than
conceding<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.770> goal

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540
