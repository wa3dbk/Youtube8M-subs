bottom graphic let's check out some of
the<00:00:19.550> features<00:00:19.669> of<00:00:19.849> the<00:00:19.939> board<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:20.720> like

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
the features of the board so like

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.530 
the features of the board so like
already<00:00:21.649> mentioned<00:00:21.950> thirty<00:00:22.669> eight<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.239> a

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
already mentioned thirty eight and a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.339 
already mentioned thirty eight and a
half<00:00:23.570> inches<00:00:23.930> long<00:00:24.349> it<00:00:24.590> is<00:00:25.180> 9.875<00:00:26.180> inches<00:00:26.989> wide

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
half inches long it is 9.875 inches wide

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.850 
half inches long it is 9.875 inches wide
this<00:00:28.250> is<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.460> directional<00:00:29.390> rocker<00:00:29.840> board<00:00:30.380> which

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
this is a directional rocker board which

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.920 
this is a directional rocker board which
as<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:31.219> can<00:00:31.250> see<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:32.210> front<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:32.599> going<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.809> be

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
as you can see the front is going to be

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.049 
as you can see the front is going to be
a<00:00:32.960> little<00:00:33.440> bit<00:00:33.590> bigger<00:00:33.800> than<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.399> back<00:00:34.579> so

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
a little bit bigger than the back so

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.669 
a little bit bigger than the back so
it's<00:00:35.179> good<00:00:35.420> for<00:00:35.629> just<00:00:35.809> pointing<00:00:36.350> down<00:00:36.500> those

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
it's good for just pointing down those

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.189 
it's good for just pointing down those
hills<00:00:36.890> bottom<00:00:37.670> in<00:00:37.760> those<00:00:37.850> hills<00:00:38.199> sliding

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
hills bottom in those hills sliding

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:40.630 
hills bottom in those hills sliding
cruising<00:00:39.769> kind<00:00:40.039> of<00:00:40.100> doing<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.309> little<00:00:40.429> bit<00:00:40.550> of

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
cruising kind of doing a little bit of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.470 
cruising kind of doing a little bit of
everything<00:00:40.730> this<00:00:41.480> board<00:00:41.839> will<00:00:42.019> handle<00:00:42.589> it<00:00:43.480> it

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
everything this board will handle it it

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.680 
everything this board will handle it it
is<00:00:45.109> nine<00:00:45.440> plies<00:00:45.980> thick<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.149> it's<00:00:47.269> a<00:00:47.329> really

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
is nine plies thick so it's a really

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.930 
is nine plies thick so it's a really
stiff<00:00:48.079> board<00:00:48.320> really<00:00:48.769> responsive<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.730> not

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
stiff board really responsive it's not

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.279 
stiff board really responsive it's not
like<00:00:50.149> gonna<00:00:50.269> be<00:00:50.359> bouncing<00:00:50.749> around<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:51.140> some

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
like gonna be bouncing around like some

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.290 
like gonna be bouncing around like some
other<00:00:51.469> boards<00:00:51.769> when<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.519> lean<00:00:52.730> on<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.179> edge

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
other boards when you lean on the edge

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.910 
other boards when you lean on the edge
you're<00:00:53.659> going<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.870> be<00:00:53.960> turning<00:00:54.140> it's<00:00:54.739> going<00:00:54.890> to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
you're going to be turning it's going to

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
it so that's really cool and then micro

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.229 
it so that's really cool and then micro
dimension<00:01:00.019> drop<00:01:00.409> through<00:01:00.829> trucks<00:01:01.399> these<00:01:02.059> are

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
dimension drop through trucks these are

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.210 
dimension drop through trucks these are
your<00:01:02.390> caliber<00:01:03.140> 44<00:01:04.010> degrees<00:01:04.239> 10<00:01:05.239> inch<00:01:05.449> trucks

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
your caliber 44 degrees 10 inch trucks

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.560 
your caliber 44 degrees 10 inch trucks
really<00:01:07.220> wide<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.700> then<00:01:07.820> mount<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.360> those

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
really wide and then mount it on those

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.820 
really wide and then mount it on those
trucks<00:01:08.840> or<00:01:09.080> your<00:01:09.650> orangatang<00:01:10.400> 70<00:01:11.330> millimeter

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
trucks or your orangatang 70 millimeter

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.890 
trucks or your orangatang 70 millimeter
83a<00:01:12.830> wheels<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.610> then<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.120> cool<00:01:14.360> thing<00:01:14.600> that

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
83a wheels and then the cool thing that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.990 
83a wheels and then the cool thing that
orangatang<00:01:15.470> does<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.890> they<00:01:16.340> give<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
orangatang does is they give you the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.320 
orangatang does is they give you the
contact<00:01:17.660> surface<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.490> wheel<00:01:19.820> is<00:01:20.000> actually

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
contact surface so the wheel is actually

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.290 
contact surface so the wheel is actually
50<00:01:20.510> 3<00:01:20.870> millimeters<00:01:21.440> wide<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.430> grippy<00:01:23.000> but

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
50 3 millimeters wide so grippy but

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.850 
50 3 millimeters wide so grippy but
still<00:01:23.510> allows<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.870> slide<00:01:24.050> over<00:01:24.350> all<00:01:24.650> just

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
still allows you to slide over all just

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.340 
still allows you to slide over all just
just<00:01:25.580> great<00:01:25.760> wheels<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.240> then<00:01:26.780> mount<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.200> in

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
just great wheels and then mount it in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.030 
just great wheels and then mount it in
those<00:01:27.620> wheels<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:30.140> bearings<00:01:30.470> don't<00:01:30.680> actually

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
those wheels the bearings don't actually

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.620 
those wheels the bearings don't actually
have<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.190> rating<00:01:31.550> system<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:32.060> think<00:01:32.510> they<00:01:32.600> just

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
have a rating system I think they just

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.720 
have a rating system I think they just
say<00:01:32.870> like<00:01:32.990> vbx<00:01:33.530> calm<00:01:33.950> skate<00:01:34.310> something<00:01:34.550> like

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
say like vbx calm skate something like

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.270 
say like vbx calm skate something like
that<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.330> really<00:01:36.050> fast<00:01:36.350> wheels<00:01:36.620> really
