spinach is so dense and filled with
vitamins<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.100> nutrients<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:43.750> lot<00:01:44.500> of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
vitamins and nutrients that a lot of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.940 
vitamins and nutrients that a lot of
this<00:01:45.610> spinach<00:01:46.450> gets<00:01:46.689> broken<00:01:46.990> down<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:47.770> you're

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
this spinach gets broken down so you're

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.889 
this spinach gets broken down so you're
still<00:01:48.250> using<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.759> same<00:01:48.970> volume<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.479> actual

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899

greens<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.440> just<00:01:50.619> gets<00:01:50.770> broken<00:01:51.039> down

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
greens it just gets broken down

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.330 
greens it just gets broken down
differently<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.149> then<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:53.049> course<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:54.130> ice

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
differently and then of course the ice
