00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
This tutorial shows how to switch between different Knife Skins.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.600
You need a knife with a skin. That means that Vanilla Knives do not work.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.460
I am going to replace this Slaughter Knife with a Case Hardened Knife. The Exterior will not change.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.880
You go to this directory and make a copy of that file. So you can restore it later when you want to play online again.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.600
You open the file and search for: "paint_kits".

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.000
Under "paint_kits" all the Skins which are in the game are listed. They all start with a number.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.920
Because all Knife Skins share the same set of skins the numbers are allways the same

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.360
The numbers for the Knife Skins are shown on the right side. I will put this in the description of this video.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:09.500
In this example i am going to replace my Slaugther Knife with a Case Hardened Knife. So I will scroll down to number "44"

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.980
*scrolling sound*

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:24.300
Copy the text from the Case Hardened Knife and paste it to the Slaugher Knife (number 59)

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.340
You save the file and start CS:GO

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:49.360
I had two different Slaughter Knives and because all knives share the same set of skin files, i got two Case Hardened Knives now.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.760
Start offline with bots to see them ingame.
