00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
grueling the road to London will be the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
grueling the road to London will be the
cutoff<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> rankings<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.949> it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
cutoff for the rankings is I think it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.179 
cutoff for the rankings is I think it's
end<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> May<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.350> depending<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.159> she

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
end of May and so depending on how she

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
end of May and so depending on how she
gets<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> tournaments<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.570> between

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
gets on in the tournaments think between

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.530 
gets on in the tournaments think between
now<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> May<00:01:07.500> she's<00:01:07.909> think<00:01:08.909> seven<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.390> eight

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
now and May she's think seven or eight

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
now and May she's think seven or eight
tournaments<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.409> depending<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.130> she

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
tournaments and so depending on how she

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
tournaments and so depending on how she
does<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.549> those<00:01:11.640> tournaments<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> where<00:01:12.479> she

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
does in those tournaments to where she

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.170 
does in those tournaments to where she
can<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> ranking<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.979> depend<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.549> whether

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
can get a ranking will depend on whether

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.460 
can get a ranking will depend on whether
she<00:01:15.390> gets<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> Paralympics<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
she gets in the Paralympics or not I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
she gets in the Paralympics or not I
mean<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.770> definitely<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.100> possibility<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
mean it's definitely a possibility I

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
mean it's definitely a possibility I
think<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.659> depends<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> drawer<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
think it just depends on the drawer and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.710 
think it just depends on the drawer and
how<00:01:20.070> she<00:01:20.130> does<00:01:20.400> how<00:01:20.549> she<00:01:20.610> performs<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.360> mean

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
how she does how she performs I mean

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.149 
how she does how she performs I mean
obviously<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:22.259> goals<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> her<00:01:22.770> goals<00:01:22.979> must

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
obviously your goals and her goals must

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
obviously your goals and her goals must
be<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.490> similar<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.939> terms<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.450> her

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
be very similar in terms of how her

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.940 
be very similar in terms of how her
developments<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> progress<00:01:25.680> over<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
developments got to progress over the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
developments got to progress over the
next<00:01:26.100> couple<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> years<00:01:26.490> where<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.299> see

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
next couple of years where do you see

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.899

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
her in say two or three years time two
or<00:01:29.970> three<00:01:30.119> years<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.509> I'd<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.619> her

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
I mean she's number 80 in the world at
the<00:01:34.290> moment<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:34.770> last<00:01:35.579> time<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.820> looked<00:01:36.090> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the moment I think last time I looked I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350 
the moment I think last time I looked I
think<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.470> three<00:01:37.740> years<00:01:37.920> time<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> long
