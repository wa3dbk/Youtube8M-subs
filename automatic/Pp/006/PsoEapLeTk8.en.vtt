good but that's what you're going to get

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.990 
good but that's what you're going to get
with<00:01:05.400> 24/7<00:01:06.390> TV<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> saw<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> team<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
with 24/7 TV what I saw was a team that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870 
with 24/7 TV what I saw was a team that
was<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.840> fully<00:01:10.470> riveted<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> coach<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
was not fully riveted on the coach and I

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
was not fully riveted on the coach and I
think<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.750> would<00:01:12.930> take<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> as

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
think that would I would take that as

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
think that would I would take that as
like<00:01:14.070> another<00:01:14.280> killer<00:01:14.729> sign<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
like another killer sign of all but a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
like another killer sign of all but a
not<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> good<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.040> eyes<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> coach

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
not a good one all eyes are on the coach

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
not a good one all eyes are on the coach
