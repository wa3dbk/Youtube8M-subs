00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello, your brother, palo romÃ¡n 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.120
 gentleman from berlin germany and I want 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.980
 this time invite you to a new 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.880
 seminar that we will be dictating 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.760
 about angels and demons you know how 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 Christians we talk a lot about 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.730
 the angels the people say 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.730
 the angels kept him cared for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.189
 we speak we ask God to send to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.160
 your angels who take care of us too 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.129
 we talk a lot about demons we talk about 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.879
 about spiritual warfare we talk about 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:42.839
 about rebuking demons but I want that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.980
 for a moment you ask yourself how many 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.200
 you really know about angels and about 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 got damn 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.010
 this is a very common situation between 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.410
 Christian people we talk a lot about a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.370
 subject but only basically 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.120
 we repeat what we have heard from others 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.790
 say why God tells us in his 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.660
 word that we scrutinize the scriptures 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.130
 that we take time to study it clearly 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.770
 It is good to listen to others 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.820
 preachers clear that it is good the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.220
 learn a doctrine that we repeat is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.700
 good because it gives us a base gives us a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.130
 trust we do things no longer as 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 we lived before but now with a new 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.009
 language with a new way of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 express ourselves of new knowledge 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.570
 but it is not enough only 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.950
 repeat what another is telling us 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.979
 we must study it with us 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.890
 themselves and a big problem that we have 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.700
 the Christians 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.740
 the lack of study so I invite you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.460
 to this time that you have this 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 opportunity to study this course on 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.850
 angels and about demons a course that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.950
 consists of only four classes something that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.970
 let's study in a simple way 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 but at the same time quite deep and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.600
 something that you can do from the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.239
 comfort of your home so in this 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.150
 moment without losing more time go to 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.900
