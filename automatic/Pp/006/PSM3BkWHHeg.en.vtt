00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
tours now a lot of people come to me and

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.589 
tours now a lot of people come to me and
ask<00:00:18.800> about<00:00:19.099> fitting<00:00:19.520> uh<00:00:19.670> performance<00:00:20.180> exhaust

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
ask about fitting uh performance exhaust

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.359 
ask about fitting uh performance exhaust
system<00:00:21.109> to<00:00:21.140> their<00:00:21.380> four-wheel-drive<00:00:21.770> I

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
system to their four-wheel-drive I

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.769 
system to their four-wheel-drive I
haven't<00:00:22.939> done<00:00:23.029> that<00:00:23.210> before

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
haven't done that before

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.689 
haven't done that before
so<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.169> decided<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.800> try<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.070> give<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.340> really

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
so I decided to try and give a really

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.370 
so I decided to try and give a really
good<00:00:25.730> true<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.329> proper<00:00:26.509> answer<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.050> them<00:00:27.230> that

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
good true and proper answer to them that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.229 
good true and proper answer to them that
I<00:00:27.590> would<00:00:27.739> do<00:00:28.070> exactly<00:00:28.520> that<00:00:28.610> fitted

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
I would do exactly that fitted

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.120 
I would do exactly that fitted
performance<00:00:29.720> exhaust<00:00:30.019> I'm<00:00:30.529> putting<00:00:31.009> on<00:00:31.099> a

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
performance exhaust I'm putting on a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.880 
performance exhaust I'm putting on a
Taipan<00:00:31.730> exhaust<00:00:32.119> system<00:00:32.570> before<00:00:33.500> we<00:00:33.680> do<00:00:33.860> that

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
Taipan exhaust system before we do that

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.070 
Taipan exhaust system before we do that
I'm<00:00:34.309> going<00:00:34.580> to<00:00:34.730> get<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:34.970> car<00:00:35.180> Dino<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.720> see

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
I'm going to get the car Dino to see

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.170 
I'm going to get the car Dino to see
just<00:00:36.379> what<00:00:36.650> power<00:00:37.040> we<00:00:37.309> are<00:00:37.460> putting<00:00:37.790> out<00:00:38.000> at

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
just what power we are putting out at

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.840 
just what power we are putting out at
the<00:00:38.300> wheels<00:00:38.540> in<00:00:38.809> normal<00:00:39.470> configuration<00:00:40.280> after

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
the wheels in normal configuration after

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.000 
the wheels in normal configuration after
we<00:00:41.120> put<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.420> exhaust<00:00:41.660> on<00:00:41.960> I'll<00:00:42.170> then<00:00:42.710> come

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
we put the exhaust on I'll then come

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.890 
we put the exhaust on I'll then come
back<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.400> get<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.519> Dino<00:00:43.820> de<00:00:44.030> game<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.570> then

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
back and get a Dino de game and then

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.689 
back and get a Dino de game and then
we'll<00:00:45.019> see<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.260> difference<00:00:45.409> but<00:00:46.370> on<00:00:46.460> top<00:00:46.640> of

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
we'll see the difference but on top of

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.549 
we'll see the difference but on top of
that<00:00:46.910> actually<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.539> to<00:00:47.690> put<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.840> uni<00:00:48.199> chip<00:00:48.410> in

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
that actually going to put a uni chip in

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.400 
that actually going to put a uni chip in
it<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:48.710> have<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.250> tuned<00:00:49.809> perfectly<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:51.379> that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
it and have it tuned perfectly to that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.680 
it and have it tuned perfectly to that
to<00:00:51.829> get<00:00:51.949> best<00:00:52.219> performance<00:00:52.879> then<00:00:53.390> we'll<00:00:53.539> put

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
to get best performance then we'll put

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.389 
to get best performance then we'll put
on<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.870> dyno<00:00:54.109> again<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.070> we'll<00:00:55.190> get<00:00:55.309> the

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
on the dyno again and we'll get the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.520 
on the dyno again and we'll get the
results<00:00:55.820> from<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:56.960> I'm<00:00:57.350> going<00:00:57.469> to

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
results from that and then I'm going to

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.110 
results from that and then I'm going to
take<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:57.980> run<00:00:58.129> all<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.399> way<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.519> birds<00:00:58.879> full

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
take it to run all the way to birds full

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.029 
take it to run all the way to birds full
of<00:00:59.239> back<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.660> we'll<00:00:59.989> get<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.320> real<00:01:00.620> hands-on

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
of back and we'll get a real hands-on

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.310 
of back and we'll get a real hands-on
feel<00:01:01.550> for<00:01:01.579> what<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.390> difference<00:01:02.750> is<00:01:02.930> better

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
feel for what the difference is better

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.229 
feel for what the difference is better
performance<00:01:03.500> better<00:01:04.339> economy<00:01:04.729> that's<00:01:05.119> what

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
performance better economy that's what

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.970 
performance better economy that's what
I'm<00:01:05.330> aiming<00:01:05.509> for

actually<00:01:25.990> go<00:01:26.230> through<00:01:26.440> a<00:01:26.530> piece<00:01:26.770> by<00:01:26.890> piece

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
actually go through a piece by piece

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually go through a piece by piece
about<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.670> exhaust<00:01:27.910> system<00:01:28.150> where<00:01:28.510> it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
about the exhaust system where it

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.430 
about the exhaust system where it
differs<00:01:28.960> from<00:01:29.460> standard<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.820> also<00:01:31.440> what

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
differs from standard and also what

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.100 
differs from standard and also what
we've<00:01:32.590> done<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.920> improve<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.490> for<00:01:33.970> longevity

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we've done to improve it for longevity

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.390 
we've done to improve it for longevity
for<00:01:35.110> those<00:01:35.260> Torre's<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.130> they<00:01:36.250> can

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
for those Torre's and that so they can

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.220 
for those Torre's and that so they can
actually<00:01:36.520> put<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:37.210> peace<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.750> mind<00:01:37.930> you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
actually put it on peace of mind you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.780 
actually put it on peace of mind you
know<00:01:38.470> something<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:38.890> fall-off<00:01:39.100> down<00:01:39.460> over

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
know something a fall-off down over

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.060 
know something a fall-off down over
corrugated<00:01:40.690> realize<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.260> now<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.740> rough

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
corrugated realize that now and rough

terrain that you four drivers push the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.600 
terrain that you four drivers push the

good traits people to handle that
product<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.790> don't<00:02:09.940> take<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.240> first

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
product so we just don't take the first

person that comes along we want to make
sure<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> workshops<00:02:13.360> are<00:02:13.540> really

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
sure that the workshops are really

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
sure that the workshops are really
skilled<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.770> can<00:02:15.310> put<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> system<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.270> it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
skilled and can put the system on and it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.770 
skilled and can put the system on and it
stays<00:02:16.570> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.050 

so<00:02:20.780> yeah<00:02:20.930> with<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> 200<00:02:21.650> series<00:02:21.830> system<00:02:22.310> what<00:02:22.940> we

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
so yeah with a 200 series system what we

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.730 
so yeah with a 200 series system what we
try<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.360> do<00:02:23.450> when<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:23.720> design<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> system<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.620> to

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
try and do when we design a system is to

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.820 
try and do when we design a system is to
actually<00:02:25.100> get<00:02:25.310> part<00:02:26.060> sitting<00:02:26.600> up<00:02:26.720> higher<00:02:26.990> then

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
actually get part sitting up higher then

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.860 
actually get part sitting up higher then
standard<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:28.730> these<00:02:28.910> are<00:02:29.120> sort<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.390> parts<00:02:29.750> that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
standard so these are sort of parts that

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.510 
standard so these are sort of parts that
we<00:02:29.960> look<00:02:30.200> at<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.590> then<00:02:30.800> we<00:02:30.830> want<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.160> try<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
we look at and then we want to try and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.070 
we look at and then we want to try and
actually<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.060> whole<00:02:32.210> system<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.750> higher

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
actually get the whole system up higher

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.990 
actually get the whole system up higher
so<00:02:33.410> when<00:02:33.890> you're<00:02:34.040> out<00:02:34.160> for<00:02:34.310> driving<00:02:34.880> you're

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
so when you're out for driving you're

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.210 
so when you're out for driving you're
not<00:02:35.090> going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.300> catch<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:36.070> already<00:02:37.070> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
not going to catch it up already the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.330 
not going to catch it up already the
scuff<00:02:37.700> marks<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.270> two<00:02:38.510> low<00:02:38.690> points<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
scuff marks on the two low points the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.590 
scuff marks on the two low points the
muck<00:02:40.520> will<00:02:40.670> get<00:02:40.820> tucked<00:02:41.060> up<00:02:41.240> as<00:02:41.390> high<00:02:41.570> as

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
muck will get tucked up as high as

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.840 
muck will get tucked up as high as
possible<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.890> does<00:02:43.130> have<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> long<00:02:43.610> range

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
possible this does have a long range

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.970 
possible this does have a long range
fuel<00:02:44.120> tank<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.750> camera<00:02:45.140> rear<00:02:45.350> bar<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.920> is

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
fuel tank and a camera rear bar it is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.740 
fuel tank and a camera rear bar it is
important<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.550> let<00:02:46.730> us<00:02:46.850> know<00:02:47.030> if<00:02:47.210> your<00:02:47.330> car<00:02:47.510> has

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
important to let us know if your car has

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.450 
important to let us know if your car has
got<00:02:48.110> aftermarket<00:02:48.740> products<00:02:49.070> on<00:02:49.190> it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
got aftermarket products on it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.890 
got aftermarket products on it
so<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> place<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.300> going<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.480> be<00:02:50.570> fitting

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
so the place that's going to be fitting

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
so the place that's going to be fitting
up<00:02:51.050> your<00:02:51.260> system<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.280> do<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.640> trouble-free

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
up your system can do it trouble-free

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.390 
up your system can do it trouble-free
okay<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.260> explaining<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.100> difference

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
okay so just explaining the difference

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.740 
okay so just explaining the difference
between<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.820> standard<00:02:56.060> system<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.660> our

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
between the standard system and our

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.780 
between the standard system and our
aftermarket<00:02:57.170> one<00:02:57.650> there's<00:02:58.250> obviously<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
aftermarket one there's obviously the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.720 
aftermarket one there's obviously the
first<00:02:59.030> part<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.420> dump<00:02:59.690> pipe<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.740> this<00:03:01.460> part

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
first part is the dump pipe so this part

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.490 
first part is the dump pipe so this part
here<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.000> can<00:03:02.270> see<00:03:02.480> we're<00:03:02.840> only<00:03:02.930> got<00:03:03.110> about<00:03:03.170> an

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
here you can see we're only got about an

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.590 
here you can see we're only got about an
inch<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.770> three<00:03:03.920> quarter<00:03:04.250> pipe<00:03:04.460> what<00:03:05.450> we've

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
inch and three quarter pipe what we've

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.210 
inch and three quarter pipe what we've
done<00:03:05.780> here<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.110> made<00:03:06.290> our<00:03:06.440> own<00:03:06.470> dump<00:03:06.980> pipe

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
done here is made our own dump pipe

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.190 
done here is made our own dump pipe
we've<00:03:07.910> stepped<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.360> up<00:03:08.450> with<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> bit<00:03:09.170> of

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
we've stepped it up with a bit of

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.690 
we've stepped it up with a bit of
stainless<00:03:09.620> steel<00:03:09.830> here<00:03:10.100> then<00:03:10.340> there's<00:03:10.520> rot

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
stainless steel here then there's rot

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.360 
stainless steel here then there's rot
mild<00:03:10.940> steel<00:03:11.350> then<00:03:12.350> we<00:03:12.470> coat<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:12.770> in<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.130> ceramic

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
mild steel then we coat it in a ceramic

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.430 
mild steel then we coat it in a ceramic
coating<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.690> does<00:03:14.960> a<00:03:14.990> couple<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.380> things

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
coating and this does a couple of things

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.500 
coating and this does a couple of things
for<00:03:16.100> us<00:03:16.130> basically<00:03:16.640> gives<00:03:16.970> us<00:03:17.060> better<00:03:17.270> gas

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
for us basically gives us better gas

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.630 
for us basically gives us better gas
flow<00:03:17.780> out<00:03:17.990> it<00:03:18.890> actually<00:03:19.220> helps<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.490> material

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
flow out it actually helps the material

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.360 
flow out it actually helps the material
hold<00:03:20.300> up<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> extreme<00:03:21.410> heat<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.220> it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
hold up in the extreme heat so it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.520 
hold up in the extreme heat so it
doesn't<00:03:22.400> crystallize<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.240> break<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.810> then

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
doesn't crystallize and break and then

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.800 
doesn't crystallize and break and then
the<00:03:24.620> other<00:03:24.770> advantages<00:03:25.490> helps<00:03:25.970> keep<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> heat

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
the other advantages helps keep the heat

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.350 
the other advantages helps keep the heat
off<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.440> floor<00:03:27.710> as<00:03:27.890> well<00:03:28.130> up<00:03:28.700> by<00:03:28.940> around<00:03:29.210> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
off the floor as well up by around the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.820 
off the floor as well up by around the
firewall<00:03:30.140> where<00:03:30.320> your<00:03:30.440> feet<00:03:30.620> are<00:03:30.770> and

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
firewall where your feet are and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.130 
firewall where your feet are and
passengers<00:03:31.670> feeder<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.660> doesn't<00:03:32.930> transfer

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
passengers feeder so it doesn't transfer

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.410 
passengers feeder so it doesn't transfer
through<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.800> body<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.130> vehicle<00:03:34.420> our

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
through the body of the vehicle our

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.660 
through the body of the vehicle our
engine<00:03:35.810> pipes<00:03:36.050> come<00:03:36.500> back<00:03:36.680> into<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.010> really

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
engine pipes come back into a really

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.940 
engine pipes come back into a really
well<00:03:37.850> designed<00:03:38.030> merge<00:03:38.480> collector<00:03:39.110> for<00:03:39.650> flow

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
well designed merge collector for flow

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.830 
well designed merge collector for flow
so<00:03:40.520> what<00:03:40.670> we've<00:03:40.820> done<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.090> actually<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.660> help

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
so what we've done is actually to help

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.140 
so what we've done is actually to help
speed<00:03:42.200> up<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.410> exhaust<00:03:42.890> flow<00:03:43.190> we've<00:03:44.000> actually

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
speed up the exhaust flow we've actually

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.540 
speed up the exhaust flow we've actually
hooked<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.540> into<00:03:44.630> our<00:03:44.960> vortex<00:03:45.200> muffler<00:03:45.860> well

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
hooked it into our vortex muffler well

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.490 
hooked it into our vortex muffler well
this<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.760> our<00:03:46.880> sports<00:03:47.150> muffler<00:03:47.630> basically

the<00:04:01.460> standard<00:04:01.880> muffler<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:02.900> actually<00:04:03.530> reduces

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
the standard muffler it actually reduces

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.530 
the standard muffler it actually reduces
down<00:04:04.370> where<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.640> goes<00:04:04.730> into<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.300> actual

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
down where it goes into the actual

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.020 
down where it goes into the actual
muffler<00:04:05.990> it's<00:04:06.710> quite<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> lot<00:04:07.460> of<00:04:07.550> restriction

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
muffler it's quite a lot of restriction

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.940 
muffler it's quite a lot of restriction
and<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.360> mate<00:04:08.780> main<00:04:09.260> muffler<00:04:09.710> on<00:04:09.830> the

standard 200 series and over over the
years<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.830> last<00:04:13.010> couple<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.430> years<00:04:13.490> they've

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
years the last couple of years they've

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.030 
years the last couple of years they've
actually<00:04:14.450> reduced<00:04:14.690> this<00:04:15.110> muffler<00:04:15.410> down<00:04:15.740> it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
actually reduced this muffler down it

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.550 
actually reduced this muffler down it
used<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:16.580> long<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.120> basically<00:04:18.049> it's

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
used to be this long and basically it's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440 
used to be this long and basically it's
shrunk<00:04:18.980> for<00:04:19.280> some<00:04:19.459> unknown<00:04:19.640> reason<00:04:20.239> obviously

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
shrunk for some unknown reason obviously

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.410 
shrunk for some unknown reason obviously
maybe<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.440> save<00:04:21.890> more<00:04:22.130> money<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:23.120> you're<00:04:23.300> out

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
maybe to save more money so you're out

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.000 
maybe to save more money so you're out
our<00:04:23.660> pipe<00:04:23.900> here's<00:04:24.140> three<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> half<00:04:24.770> inch

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
our pipe here's three and a half inch

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.230 
our pipe here's three and a half inch
and<00:04:25.190> as<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.400> can<00:04:25.520> see<00:04:25.640> we've<00:04:25.790> got<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.940> couple<00:04:26.150> of

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
and as you can see we've got a couple of

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.969 
and as you can see we've got a couple of
joins<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.900> that's<00:04:27.380> basically<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.890> go

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
joins in it that's basically to go

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.560 
joins in it that's basically to go
around<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.400> long<00:04:28.550> range<00:04:28.760> fuel<00:04:29.090> tank<00:04:29.360> that's

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
around the long range fuel tank that's

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.780 
around the long range fuel tank that's
so<00:04:29.720> tight<00:04:30.050> our<00:04:30.320> man

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
so tight our man

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.000 
so tight our man
into<00:04:30.970> won't<00:04:31.150> pull<00:04:31.420> those<00:04:31.600> bends<00:04:32.440> there<00:04:32.740> so

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
into won't pull those bends there so

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.300 
into won't pull those bends there so
with<00:04:33.730> our<00:04:33.940> bender<00:04:34.840> we<00:04:35.290> need<00:04:35.500> at<00:04:35.650> least<00:04:35.680> about

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
with our bender we need at least about

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.480 
with our bender we need at least about
120<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.060> 130<00:04:37.660> between<00:04:38.080> bends<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:39.040> what<00:04:39.220> we<00:04:39.340> do

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
120 to 130 between bends so what we do

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.130 
120 to 130 between bends so what we do
is<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:39.790> just<00:04:39.970> hand<00:04:40.180> make<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.570> piece<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.020> go

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
is we just hand make this piece to go

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.050 
is we just hand make this piece to go
around<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.500> long-range<00:04:41.800> fuel<00:04:42.040> tank<00:04:42.370> if<00:04:42.850> it's

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
around the long-range fuel tank if it's

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.100 
around the long-range fuel tank if it's
a<00:04:43.120> car<00:04:43.330> that's<00:04:43.360> not<00:04:43.630> going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.900> have<00:04:43.990> our

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
a car that's not going to have our

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.540 
a car that's not going to have our
long-range<00:04:44.500> fuel<00:04:44.710> tank<00:04:45.010> on<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:45.430> can

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
long-range fuel tank on it we can

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.980 
long-range fuel tank on it we can
actually<00:04:45.670> pull<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.030> in<00:04:46.300> one<00:04:46.450> piece

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
actually pull that in one piece

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.080 
actually pull that in one piece
that's<00:04:47.260> consequently<00:04:47.950> why<00:04:48.190> this<00:04:48.670> has<00:04:48.880> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
that's consequently why this has the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:57.020 
that's consequently why this has the
couple<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.660> joins<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.170> it

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.180 

there<00:04:57.600> we<00:04:57.690> go<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.050> Taipan<00:04:58.440> exhaust<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:59.070> now

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
there we go the Taipan exhaust is now

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.310 
there we go the Taipan exhaust is now
been<00:04:59.430> fitted<00:04:59.820> its<00:05:00.030> up<00:05:00.180> nice<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.570> high

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
been fitted its up nice and high

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.750 
been fitted its up nice and high
fact<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.710> reckon<00:05:01.920> I've<00:05:02.010> got<00:05:02.070> more<00:05:02.340> clearance

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
fact I reckon I've got more clearance

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.310 
fact I reckon I've got more clearance
now<00:05:03.030> than<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.270> did<00:05:03.330> with<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.660> original<00:05:03.690> exhaust

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
now than I did with the original exhaust

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.500 
now than I did with the original exhaust
I'm<00:05:04.890> going<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.130> go<00:05:05.220> back<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.490> Auto<00:05:05.970> Tech<00:05:06.330> now

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
I'm going to go back to Auto Tech now

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.450 
I'm going to go back to Auto Tech now
put<00:05:06.990> on<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.230> dyno<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.740> we'll<00:05:07.950> see<00:05:08.190> what<00:05:08.340> the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
put on the dyno and we'll see what the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.760 
put on the dyno and we'll see what the
powder<00:05:14.630> okay<00:05:15.630> Victor<00:05:16.020> there<00:05:16.170> we<00:05:16.290> go<00:05:16.440> there's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
powder okay Victor there we go there's

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.160 
powder okay Victor there we go there's
the<00:05:16.920> three<00:05:17.160> runs<00:05:17.400> there<00:05:17.700> we<00:05:18.270> had<00:05:18.450> before<00:05:18.720> run

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
the three runs there we had before run

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.810 
the three runs there we had before run
when<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.440> car<00:05:19.650> was<00:05:19.800> totally<00:05:20.190> extended<00:05:20.670> if

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
when the car was totally extended if

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.350 
when the car was totally extended if
we've<00:05:21.210> got<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.720> after<00:05:22.320> run<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.970> run<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.270> the

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
we've got the after run the run of the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.060 
we've got the after run the run of the
power<00:05:24.570> run<00:05:24.750> after<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.260> exhaust<00:05:25.620> was<00:05:25.800> fitted

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
power run after the exhaust was fitted

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.070 
power run after the exhaust was fitted
now<00:05:26.220> we've<00:05:26.370> got<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.790> complete<00:05:27.630> package<00:05:27.870> with

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
now we've got the complete package with

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.170 
now we've got the complete package with
the<00:05:28.410> exhaust<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.340> custom<00:05:29.760> tune<00:05:29.970> they're

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
the exhaust and the custom tune they're

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.570 
the exhaust and the custom tune they're
using<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.690> Unity<00:05:31.200> yeah<00:05:31.500> as<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:32.040> can<00:05:32.070> see<00:05:32.220> here

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
using the Unity yeah as you can see here

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.040 
using the Unity yeah as you can see here
once<00:05:32.730> you<00:05:32.850> bolt<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.270> up<00:05:33.330> your<00:05:33.570> type<00:05:33.780> and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
once you bolt it up your type and

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.840 
once you bolt it up your type and
exhaust<00:05:34.410> sells<00:05:34.620> an<00:05:34.740> increase<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.310> about<00:05:35.430> 10

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
exhaust sells an increase of about 10

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.790 
exhaust sells an increase of about 10
kilowatts<00:05:36.330> at<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.570> wheels<00:05:36.780> so<00:05:37.200> it's<00:05:37.650> not<00:05:37.740> a

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
kilowatts at the wheels so it's not a

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.410 
kilowatts at the wheels so it's not a
huge<00:05:38.130> increase<00:05:38.340> but<00:05:38.790> what<00:05:38.910> people<00:05:39.210> have<00:05:39.300> got

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
huge increase but what people have got

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.910 
huge increase but what people have got
to<00:05:39.510> understand<00:05:39.930> it's<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.410> power<00:05:40.590> that

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
to understand it's not the power that

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.260 
to understand it's not the power that
they're<00:05:41.100> looking<00:05:41.220> for<00:05:41.640> as<00:05:41.820> well

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
they're looking for as well

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.840 
they're looking for as well
it's<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.990> dropping<00:05:43.530> exhaust<00:05:44.340> temperatures

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
it's the dropping exhaust temperatures

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.690 
it's the dropping exhaust temperatures
and<00:05:45.030> EEG<00:05:45.510> T's<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.830> that's<00:05:47.130> also<00:05:47.310> going<00:05:47.640> to

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
and EEG T's so that's also going to

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.760 
and EEG T's so that's also going to
contribute<00:05:48.420> to<00:05:48.630> longevity<00:05:49.230> of<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.440> engine

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
contribute to longevity of the engine

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.320 
contribute to longevity of the engine
and<00:05:49.920> allow<00:05:50.130> you<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.430> load<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.880> car<00:05:51.120> up<00:05:51.300> more

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
and allow you to load the car up more

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.140 
and allow you to load the car up more
without<00:05:51.840> causing<00:05:52.590> any<00:05:52.650> engine<00:05:53.100> damage<00:05:53.310> so

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
without causing any engine damage so

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.510 
without causing any engine damage so
once<00:05:54.690> we<00:05:54.900> tuned<00:05:55.200> it<00:05:55.380> and<00:05:55.530> we<00:05:55.980> installed<00:05:56.370> the

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
once we tuned it and we installed the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.820 
once we tuned it and we installed the
unity<00:05:57.000> between<00:05:57.180> we've<00:05:57.750> custom<00:05:58.290> tuned<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:58.710> now

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
unity between we've custom tuned and now

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.470 
unity between we've custom tuned and now
it's<00:05:59.040> gone<00:05:59.190> -<00:05:59.370> one<00:05:59.520> sixty<00:05:59.880> eight<00:06:00.000> point<00:06:00.210> five

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
it's gone - one sixty eight point five

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.870 
it's gone - one sixty eight point five
so<00:06:00.690> that's<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:00.930> total<00:06:01.320> improvement<00:06:01.950> roughly

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
so that's a total improvement roughly

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.440 
so that's a total improvement roughly
50%<00:06:03.470> yeah<00:06:04.470> that's<00:06:04.800> right<00:06:04.950> I'm<00:06:05.100> real<00:06:05.370> yeah<00:06:05.700> well

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
50% yeah that's right I'm real yeah well

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.770 
50% yeah that's right I'm real yeah well
so<00:06:07.290> and<00:06:07.740> in<00:06:08.190> saying<00:06:08.730> that<00:06:08.940> -<00:06:09.120> we've<00:06:09.300> also<00:06:09.480> had<00:06:09.750> a

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
so and in saying that - we've also had a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.960 
so and in saying that - we've also had a
dramatic<00:06:10.440> increasing<00:06:11.280> torque<00:06:11.520> as<00:06:11.700> you<00:06:11.820> can

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
dramatic increasing torque as you can

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.390 
dramatic increasing torque as you can
see<00:06:12.150> here<00:06:12.390> so<00:06:12.660> they've<00:06:13.200> gone<00:06:13.380> from<00:06:13.680> four

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
see here so they've gone from four

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.430 
see here so they've gone from four
roughly<00:06:14.850> four<00:06:15.690> and<00:06:15.810> a<00:06:15.840> half<00:06:15.900> thousand

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
roughly four and a half thousand

roughly four and a half thousand

if<00:06:19.470> that<00:06:19.680> isn't<00:06:19.950> probably<00:06:20.430> 25<00:06:21.420> to<00:06:21.450> 30<00:06:21.840> plenty

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
if that isn't probably 25 to 30 plenty

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.770 
if that isn't probably 25 to 30 plenty
by<00:06:22.290> over<00:06:22.470> 30<00:06:22.620> percent<00:06:22.710> oh<00:06:23.100> yeah<00:06:23.280> yeah<00:06:23.640> is<00:06:24.570> it

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
by over 30 percent oh yeah yeah is it

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.540 
by over 30 percent oh yeah yeah is it
isn't<00:06:25.020> right<00:06:25.380> that<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:25.920> should<00:06:25.950> just<00:06:26.250> do<00:06:26.400> the

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
isn't right that you should just do the

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.880 
isn't right that you should just do the
exhaust<00:06:26.940> or<00:06:27.180> do<00:06:27.720> everything<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.230> got<00:06:28.440> down<00:06:28.650> here

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
exhaust or do everything I got down here

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.890 
exhaust or do everything I got down here
now<00:06:29.520> I've<00:06:29.640> done<00:06:29.790> the<00:06:29.940> exhaust<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.540> type<00:06:30.720> that

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
now I've done the exhaust to type that

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.490 
now I've done the exhaust to type that
exhaust<00:06:31.260> and<00:06:31.530> and<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:32.660> Uni<00:06:33.660> chip<00:06:33.900> and<00:06:34.110> dyno

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.050 
exhaust and and the Uni chip and dyno
tune<00:06:34.800> yeah<00:06:34.950> yeah<00:06:35.340> can<00:06:35.490> you<00:06:35.580> get<00:06:35.700> away<00:06:35.820> with

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
tune yeah yeah can you get away with

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.430 
tune yeah yeah can you get away with
just<00:06:36.090> doing<00:06:36.330> the<00:06:36.570> exhaust<00:06:36.720> yeah<00:06:37.200> a<00:06:37.230> lot<00:06:37.410> of

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
just doing the exhaust yeah a lot of

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.350 
just doing the exhaust yeah a lot of
people<00:06:37.770> do<00:06:37.920> they<00:06:38.190> do<00:06:38.250> it<00:06:38.490> for<00:06:38.730> the<00:06:38.820> very<00:06:38.970> reason

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
people do they do it for the very reason

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.700 
people do they do it for the very reason
that<00:06:39.390> I<00:06:39.510> mentioned<00:06:39.900> earlier<00:06:40.140> they<00:06:40.290> just<00:06:40.530> want

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
that I mentioned earlier they just want

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.530 
that I mentioned earlier they just want
to<00:06:40.770> put<00:06:40.920> an<00:06:41.010> exhaust<00:06:41.280> on<00:06:41.520> there<00:06:41.700> to<00:06:41.790> reduce<00:06:42.390> the

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
to put an exhaust on there to reduce the

to put an exhaust on there to reduce the
restriction<00:06:43.080> yeah<00:06:43.790> look<00:06:44.790> what<00:06:45.120> we<00:06:45.300> saw<00:06:45.510> on<00:06:45.540> the

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
restriction yeah look what we saw on the

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.290 
restriction yeah look what we saw on the

you've<00:06:52.740> got<00:06:52.890> to<00:06:52.980> remember<00:06:53.160> to<00:06:53.460> especially<00:06:53.910> for

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
you've got to remember to especially for

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.940 
you've got to remember to especially for
someone<00:06:54.420> like<00:06:54.540> you<00:06:54.810> that's<00:06:55.050> really<00:06:55.200> using

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
someone like you that's really using

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.830 
someone like you that's really using
this<00:06:56.040> as<00:06:56.250> an<00:06:56.340> off-road<00:06:56.670> vehicle<00:06:56.700> not<00:06:57.210> Road<00:06:57.420> not

as<00:06:57.990> a<00:06:58.020> road<00:06:58.320> car<00:06:58.350> you<00:06:59.310> know<00:06:59.460> by<00:06:59.670> reducing<00:07:00.150> the

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
as a road car you know by reducing the

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.000 
as a road car you know by reducing the
GTS<00:07:00.870> which<00:07:01.050> is<00:07:01.200> your<00:07:01.440> exhaust<00:07:01.770> gas

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
GTS which is your exhaust gas

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.070 
GTS which is your exhaust gas
temperatures<00:07:02.580> you're<00:07:03.210> increasing<00:07:04.020> the

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
temperatures you're increasing the

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.290 
temperatures you're increasing the
longevity<00:07:04.230> of<00:07:04.620> the<00:07:04.800> engines<00:07:05.220> so<00:07:05.460> yeah<00:07:05.880> it's<00:07:06.180> a

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
longevity of the engines so yeah it's a

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.470 
longevity of the engines so yeah it's a
good<00:07:06.480> idea<00:07:06.540> that<00:07:07.110> if<00:07:07.530> you<00:07:07.650> do<00:07:08.120> to<00:07:09.120> get<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.330> best

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
good idea that if you do to get the best

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.030 
good idea that if you do to get the best
benefit<00:07:09.870> out<00:07:09.990> of<00:07:10.020> the<00:07:10.200> exhaust<00:07:10.470> system<00:07:10.590> it's

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
benefit out of the exhaust system it's

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.860 
benefit out of the exhaust system it's
always<00:07:11.280> a<00:07:11.310> good<00:07:11.520> idea<00:07:11.640> to<00:07:11.910> tune<00:07:12.210> it<00:07:12.360> as<00:07:12.480> well<00:07:12.660> I

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
always a good idea to tune it as well I

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.330 
always a good idea to tune it as well I
mean<00:07:13.020> you<00:07:13.140> can<00:07:13.260> certified<00:07:13.800> professional

dramatic increase in you know the result

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.300 
dramatic increase in you know the result
that's<00:07:18.180> just<00:07:18.510> amazing<00:07:18.750> I<00:07:19.110> can't<00:07:19.740> wait<00:07:19.950> to<00:07:20.130> put
