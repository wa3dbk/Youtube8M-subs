and<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.650> sure<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.009> what's<00:01:23.250> going

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and I'm pretty sure this is what's going

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.679 
and I'm pretty sure this is what's going
to<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.180> they<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.479> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to be on all of them they have this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.039 
to be on all of them they have this
yellow<00:01:25.020> band<00:01:25.430> running<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:27.360> around<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.840> box

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
yellow band running right around the box

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.060 
yellow band running right around the box
so<00:01:28.860> expect<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.720> more

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
so expect that to be on a lot more

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.149 
so expect that to be on a lot more
merchandise<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> future<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.210> has<00:01:33.540> been<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
merchandise in the future it has been on

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
merchandise in the future it has been on
merchandise<00:01:35.159> since<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.790> Pandorica<00:01:36.710> wave<00:01:37.710> of

merchandise since the Pandorica wave of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
merchandise since the Pandorica wave of
figures<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.000> although<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.509> figure

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
figures you know although the figure

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.139 
figures you know although the figure
does<00:01:39.960> come<00:01:40.350> fully<00:01:40.619> constructed<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
does come fully constructed in the

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.210 
does come fully constructed in the
actual<00:01:42.540> sets<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.939> obviously<00:01:45.360> here

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
actual sets you can obviously here

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
actual sets you can obviously here
deconstruct<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.479> very<00:01:48.630> easy<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
deconstruct it and it is very easy to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
deconstruct it and it is very easy to
put<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:49.380> together<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.970> face

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
put back together as you can see face

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.820 
put back together as you can see face
and<00:01:56.659> like

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.940 

so<00:02:02.370> it<00:02:03.370> obviously<00:02:03.790> as<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.510> can<00:02:04.630> see<00:02:04.840> easily<00:02:05.470> is

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
so it obviously as you can see easily is

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.359 
so it obviously as you can see easily is
put<00:02:06.340> together<00:02:06.550> once<00:02:07.000> again<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:08.190> here's<00:02:09.190> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
put together once again so here's the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.160 
put together once again so here's the
figure<00:02:09.670> I'm<00:02:09.880> just<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.390> quick<00:02:10.600> rundown<00:02:10.810> on

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
figure I'm just a quick rundown on

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.700 
figure I'm just a quick rundown on
articulation<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.810> basic<00:02:14.230> head

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
articulation we have the basic head

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.210 
articulation we have the basic head
swivel<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.230> neck<00:02:17.470> also<00:02:17.710> swivels<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.980> does

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
swivel the neck also swivels and so does

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.540 
swivel the neck also swivels and so does
this<00:02:21.280> center<00:02:22.060> section<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.630> red<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.400> can

this center section of red if you can

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.140 
this center section of red if you can
see<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:25.000> round<00:02:26.250> basically<00:02:27.250> anything<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.790> is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
see all round basically anything that is

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.140 
see all round basically anything that is
made<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> little<00:02:29.470> sort<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.890> ball<00:02:30.730> joint

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
made on a little sort of ball joint

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.070 
made on a little sort of ball joint
socket<00:02:31.750> sort<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.050> thing<00:02:32.260> we'll<00:02:33.130> move<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.900> would

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
socket sort of thing we'll move it would

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
within that um but overall it is a great

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.720 
within that um but overall it is a great
figure<00:02:49.570> because<00:02:50.050> well<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.920> don't<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.490> any

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730

other<00:02:51.940> character<00:02:52.209> options<00:02:52.840> things<00:02:53.230> apart

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
other character options things apart

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.699 
other character options things apart
from<00:02:53.770> these<00:02:54.310> two<00:02:54.550> things<00:02:54.820> which<00:02:55.350> will<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.530> up

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
from these two things which will be up

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.900 
from these two things which will be up
next<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.380> great<00:02:59.650> way<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.830> start<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
next and it is a great way to start and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.720 
next and it is a great way to start and
obviously<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.050> Dalek<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:03.040> need<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.370> Dalek

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
obviously it's a Dalek you need a Dalek

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.350 
obviously it's a Dalek you need a Dalek
at<00:03:03.940> least<00:03:04.300> once<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:06.250> here<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.850> get<00:03:07.030> five

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
at least once and here you get five

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.000 
at least once and here you get five
which<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.290> great<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.480> if<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.170> do<00:03:11.530> want<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.830> get
