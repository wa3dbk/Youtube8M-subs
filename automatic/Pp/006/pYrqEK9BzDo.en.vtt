generate color they had tons of chips

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.070 
generate color they had tons of chips
and<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.970> figured<00:00:24.420> out<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.960> with

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and I figured out a way to do it with

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.800 
and I figured out a way to do it with
one<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.619> dollar<00:00:25.890> chip<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
one little one dollar chip and I and it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.419 
one little one dollar chip and I and it
was<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.260> strange<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> happened<00:00:29.279> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
was really strange how it happened but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.669 
was really strange how it happened but
this<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:29.970> apply<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> young<00:00:30.420> children<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.990> was

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this would apply to young children I was

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.380 
this would apply to young children I was
without<00:00:31.859> sleep<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.550> four<00:00:32.850> days<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.059> nights

because<00:00:34.200> Steve<00:00:34.890> Jobs<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> project

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
because Steve Jobs and I got a project

to<00:00:36.180> design<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.480> game<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.960> Atari<00:00:37.230> called

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to design a game for Atari called

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400 
to design a game for Atari called
breakout<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.180> he<00:00:39.690> said<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.050> Evie<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.959 
breakout and we and he said it's Evie to
the<00:00:40.530> money<00:00:40.710> quick<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.219> had<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.790> days

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the money quick so we had do it for days

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and nights I didn't think it was

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
and nights I didn't think it was
possible<00:00:43.730> back<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.059> games<00:00:45.239> weren't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
possible back then and games weren't

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
software they were hardware little chips

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
software they were hardware little chips
and<00:00:47.820> voltages<00:00:48.270> two<00:00:48.539> wires<00:00:49.020> from<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and voltages two wires from here to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.439 
and voltages two wires from here to
there<00:00:49.739> make<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> work<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.670> didn't<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
there make it work and I didn't think it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
there make it work and I didn't think it
was<00:00:51.510> possible<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> said<00:00:52.410> I'll<00:00:52.500> try<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
was possible but I said I'll try it and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
was possible but I said I'll try it and
I<00:00:53.430> designed<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> whole<00:00:54.030> thing<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I designed the whole thing and we got it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.750 
I designed the whole thing and we got it
done<00:00:55.860> four<00:00:56.100> days<00:00:56.129> nights<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.489> when<00:00:56.640> you're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
done four days nights but when you're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
done four days nights but when you're
without<00:00:56.969> sleep<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.289> sleep

you're waking up your heads a little
like<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> well<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.350> head<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> in

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070

or something and they just put little

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
what bench I was that Steve was was
wiring<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> board<00:01:37.110> over<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> I'm

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
wiring up the board over there and I'm

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.410 
wiring up the board over there and I'm
reg<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.280> bench<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.240> started

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
reg this one bench I just started

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.080 
reg this one bench I just started
drifted<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.960> thought<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.090> signals

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
drifted and I thought you know signals

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
drifted and I thought you know signals
for<00:01:42.299> color<00:01:42.509> TVs<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.259> remember<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:43.890> high

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
for color TVs I remember from high

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.530 
for color TVs I remember from high
school<00:01:44.369> electronics<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.970> go<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.420> down

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
school electronics they go up and down

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
school electronics they go up and down
and<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> certain<00:01:46.680> speed<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and up and down at a certain speed and I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.490 
and up and down at a certain speed and I
thought<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.299> made<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> signal<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
thought what if you made a signal that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.660 
thought what if you made a signal that
went<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
went up and down and up and down a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
went up and down and up and down a
different<00:01:51.030> rate<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> look<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.079> color

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
different rate would it look like color

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.920 
different rate would it look like color
just<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> digital<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.090> normal<00:01:54.450> simple<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
just a digital the normal simple thing I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
just a digital the normal simple thing I
can<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.590> almost<00:01:55.920> no<00:01:56.130> parts<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.700> would

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
can do with almost no parts at all would

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
can do with almost no parts at all would
it<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.540> color<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.740> oh<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.460> gosh<00:01:59.670> I

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it look like color and then oh my gosh I

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.249 
it look like color and then oh my gosh I
figured<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> way<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.780> could<00:02:01.140> have

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
figured out a way that I could have

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
figured out a way that I could have
little<00:02:01.530> Ford<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.310> 01<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.090> circling

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
little Ford little 01 bit circling

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
little Ford little 01 bit circling
around<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.380> could<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.219> down<00:02:05.369> at

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
around and it could go up and down at

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
around and it could go up and down at
different<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> red<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.140> become<00:02:07.350> blue

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
different time and red would become blue

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.499 
different time and red would become blue
I<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.459> put<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> different<00:02:09.000> pattern<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.360> ones

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
I can put in a different pattern of ones

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.510 
I can put in a different pattern of ones
and<00:02:09.599> zeros<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.050> had<00:02:10.140> 16<00:02:10.530> patterns<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> could

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and zeros I had 16 patterns and it could

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.710 
and zeros I had 16 patterns and it could
become<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> different<00:02:12.000> shade<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> might<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
become a different shade I might be a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.340 
become a different shade I might be a
little<00:02:12.870> lighter

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
little lighter

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
little lighter
I<00:02:13.380> might<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.710> little<00:02:13.830> darker<00:02:14.070> would<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:14.970> work

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I might be a little darker would it work

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360 
I might be a little darker would it work
you<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.080> didn't<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.340> I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you know and didn't know but when I

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280 
you know and didn't know but when I
finally<00:02:17.640> wired<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.570> about<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.900> year<00:02:18.990> later

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
finally wired it up about a year later

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.670 
finally wired it up about a year later
um<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.790> brought<00:02:21.240> Steve<00:02:21.480> over<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.020> mean<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.470> saw

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
um and brought Steve over I mean we saw

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.220 
um and brought Steve over I mean we saw
it<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:23.130> was<00:02:23.220> Eureka<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.900> knew<00:02:25.050> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it that was Eureka you know we knew this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.190 
it that was Eureka you know we knew this
was<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> change<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.220> big<00:02:26.250> change<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.910> world

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
was a change a big change in the world

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
was a change a big change in the world
so<00:02:28.200> sometimes<00:02:28.500> sometimes<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.700> you're

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
so sometimes sometimes you just you're

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.940 
so sometimes sometimes you just you're
not<00:02:30.660> sure<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.110> going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.350> work<00:02:31.410> because

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
not sure if it's going to work because

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.640 
not sure if it's going to work because
it<00:02:32.220> didn't<00:02:32.490> follow<00:02:32.790> all<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.750> methodology<00:02:34.500> all

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
it didn't follow all the methodology all

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
it didn't follow all the methodology all
the<00:02:34.980> science<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> books<00:02:35.970> all<00:02:36.180> those

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the science it's in the books all those

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.900 
the science it's in the books all those
numbers<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.620> similar<00:02:38.040> enough<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.700> might

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
numbers get it's similar enough it might

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.230 
numbers get it's similar enough it might
work<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.720> case<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.050> did
