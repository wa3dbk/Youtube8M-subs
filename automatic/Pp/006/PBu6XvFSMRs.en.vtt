flat<00:00:03.210> major<00:00:03.720> scale<00:00:03.990> but<00:00:04.950> play<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.370> starting

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
flat major scale but play it starting

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:15.820 
flat major scale but play it starting
from<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.779> get<00:00:07.170> something<00:00:07.319> like<00:00:07.470> this

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:26.550 

again

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.710 

and<00:00:27.560> there'll<00:00:28.100> be<00:00:28.160> a<00:00:28.430> locket<00:00:29.000> which<00:00:29.300> is<00:00:29.510> you

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
and there'll be a locket which is you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.979 
and there'll be a locket which is you
said<00:00:30.439> mostly<00:00:31.189> in<00:00:31.340> jazz<00:00:31.660> one<00:00:32.660> thing<00:00:32.900> that's

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
said mostly in jazz one thing that's

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.120 
said mostly in jazz one thing that's
very<00:00:33.140> important<00:00:33.650> that<00:00:33.770> you<00:00:33.800> need<00:00:33.980> to

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
very important that you need to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.490 
very important that you need to
understand<00:00:34.790> is<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.420> relative<00:00:35.960> minor<00:00:36.200> and

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
understand is the relative minor and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.210 
understand is the relative minor and
major<00:00:37.870> scales<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.170> how<00:00:39.290> they<00:00:39.470> how<00:00:39.890> they<00:00:39.920> work

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
major scales and how they how they work

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.350 
major scales and how they how they work
together<00:00:40.400> relative<00:00:41.239> minor<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.960> major

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
together relative minor to the major

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.890 
together relative minor to the major
basically<00:00:44.360> if<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:44.870> take<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> major<00:00:45.559> chord<00:00:46.900> and

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
basically if you take a major chord and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.740 
basically if you take a major chord and
who<00:00:48.170> three<00:00:48.590> frets<00:00:48.980> back<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.330> play<00:00:50.479> a<00:00:50.510> minor

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
who three frets back and play a minor

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.290 
who three frets back and play a minor
chord<00:00:51.729> that's<00:00:52.729> G<00:00:53.140> any<00:00:54.140> minor<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.670> scales<00:00:56.000> of

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
chord that's G any minor the scales of

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.299 
chord that's G any minor the scales of
those<00:00:56.510> two<00:00:57.050> cores<00:00:57.320> are<00:00:57.650> interchangeable

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
those two cores are interchangeable

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.880 
those two cores are interchangeable
sochi<00:00:58.820> major<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.989> minor

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.399 

or<00:01:06.979> or<00:01:07.760> have<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.570> same<00:01:08.810> notes<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.380> are

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
or or have the same notes that are

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.430 
or or have the same notes that are
starting<00:01:09.979> from<00:01:10.159> different<00:01:10.490> intervals<00:01:11.440> so

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
starting from different intervals so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.050 
starting from different intervals so
this<00:01:12.560> can<00:01:12.740> work<00:01:12.860> in<00:01:13.070> another<00:01:13.250> position<00:01:13.520> say<00:01:14.000> C

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
this can work in another position say C

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:27.520 
this can work in another position say C
major<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:16.760> minor<00:01:25.810> all<00:01:26.810> those<00:01:27.140> know<00:01:27.380> it's

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
major and a minor all those know it's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.100 
major and a minor all those know it's
the<00:01:27.710> same<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.310> can<00:01:28.490> solo<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.300> if<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.900> want

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
the same so you can solo and if you want

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.980 
the same so you can solo and if you want
in<00:01:30.380> G<00:01:31.040> but<00:01:31.880> solo<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.400> key<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:34.700> G<00:01:34.820> but<00:01:35.330> solo<00:01:35.840> in

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
in G but solo in a key of G but solo in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.840 
in G but solo in a key of G but solo in
E<00:01:36.080> minor<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.680> I'll<00:01:36.950> give<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> different

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
E minor and I'll give you a different

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.380 
E minor and I'll give you a different
sort<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.300> flavor<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:39.880> then<00:01:40.880> just<00:01:41.119> if

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
sort of flavor and really then just if

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.700 
sort of flavor and really then just if
you<00:01:41.570> would<00:01:41.750> play<00:01:41.990> notes<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:43.210> G<00:01:44.210> major<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:45.530> not

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
you would play notes in G major it's not

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.700 
you would play notes in G major it's not
just<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.070> major<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.759> minor<00:01:47.060> chords<00:01:47.720> and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
just the major and minor chords and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.400 
just the major and minor chords and
scales<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.460> are<00:01:49.640> interchangeable<00:01:50.410> also

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
scales that are interchangeable also

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.400 
scales that are interchangeable also
other<00:01:51.770> modes<00:01:52.070> for<00:01:52.820> example<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.869> might<00:01:54.020> take

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
other modes for example you might take

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.800 
other modes for example you might take
take<00:01:54.679> be<00:01:54.950> Phrygian<00:01:55.429> which<00:01:56.300> happens<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.720> be

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
take be Phrygian which happens to be

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.900 
take be Phrygian which happens to be
exactly<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.440> same<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.920> e<00:01:58.369> minor<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.410> G<00:02:00.410> major

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
exactly the same as e minor and G major

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.210 
exactly the same as e minor and G major
it's<00:02:01.910> just<00:02:02.119> played<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.630> starting<00:02:03.440> from<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.770> so

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
it's just played in starting from be so

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.389 
it's just played in starting from be so
if<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.789> play<00:02:05.690> be<00:02:05.869> Phrygian<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.950> Phrygian

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
if you play be Phrygian the Phrygian

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:17.500 
if you play be Phrygian the Phrygian
position<00:02:07.789> which<00:02:07.970> we<00:02:08.119> learnt<00:02:08.300> out<00:02:08.509> here

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.610 

you're<00:02:18.510> afraid<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> me<00:02:19.170> c<00:02:20.010> d<00:02:20.730> e<00:02:21.150> f<00:02:21.900> sharp<00:02:22.620> g<00:02:23.690> 9<00:02:24.690> so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
you're afraid of me c d e f sharp g 9 so

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.350 
you're afraid of me c d e f sharp g 9 so
they're<00:02:26.040> exactly<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> same<00:02:26.550> noises<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:27.210> G

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
they're exactly the same noises in G

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.430 
they're exactly the same noises in G
major<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:27.990> Minor<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.540> basically

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
major and the Minor and so basically

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.140 
major and the Minor and so basically
they're<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:32.040> sort<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> interchangeable<00:02:32.970> was

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
they're all sort of interchangeable was

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.610 
they're all sort of interchangeable was
starting<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.630> different<00:02:33.930> positions<00:02:34.020> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
starting from different positions and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.460 
starting from different positions and
basically<00:02:35.460> if<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.960> what<00:02:37.290> knows

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
basically if you just know what knows

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.400 
basically if you just know what knows
you're<00:02:37.740> playing<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.810> playing<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.350> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you're playing you could be playing in a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.740 
you're playing you could be playing in a
moment<00:02:40.830> when<00:02:41.160> really<00:02:41.370> you're<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:41.640> playing<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
moment when really you're just playing a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.560 
moment when really you're just playing a
normal<00:02:43.110> major<00:02:43.320> scale<00:02:43.740> or<00:02:44.250> minor<00:02:44.550> scale<00:02:44.970> it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
normal major scale or minor scale it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.200 
normal major scale or minor scale it's
just<00:02:45.840> um<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.710> know<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.370> notes<00:02:48.000> are

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
just um but you know what the notes are

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:57.260 
just um but you know what the notes are
another<00:02:48.960> one<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.440> e<00:02:49.590> Lydian<00:02:55.550> Lydians<00:02:56.550> exactly

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
another one is e Lydian Lydians exactly

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.900 
another one is e Lydian Lydians exactly
the<00:02:57.390> same<00:02:57.600> as<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.910> be<00:02:59.910> major<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.110> also<00:03:01.800> was<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the same as so be major and also was the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.660 
the same as so be major and also was the
roads<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.210> minor<00:03:03.480> theory<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.230> G<00:03:05.190> sharp<00:03:05.400> minor

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
roads of minor theory and G sharp minor

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.810

so<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:07.020> play<00:03:07.230> B<00:03:07.560> major<00:03:07.740> would<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.580> shot

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
so you can play B major would you shot

so you can play B major would you shot
on<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:10.590> an<00:03:10.740> e<00:03:10.860> Lydian<00:03:11.450> your<00:03:12.450> Annie<00:03:12.660> backing

and i'll give you the Lydian effect

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.580 
and i'll give you the Lydian effect
rather<00:03:16.890> than<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.310> num<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:18.210> playing<00:03:18.480> e<00:03:18.810> Lydian

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
that with all the same basically um it's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.920 
that with all the same basically um it's
just<00:03:23.370> understanding<00:03:24.210> what<00:03:24.420> noise<00:03:24.660> you're

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
just understanding what noise you're

just understanding what noise you're
playing<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:27.150> use<00:03:27.330> them
