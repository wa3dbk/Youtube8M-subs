00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.150
 So good morning folks, I'll find out these 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.580
 days that every time I put my 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 iCloud account on any cell phone 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 both iphones and phone boom 65 s 54 s 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.220
 any model that I placed half 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.260
 iCloud point i could not get 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.380
 access to my contacts 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 how I used to go here and, for example, 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.530
 I tried to get in that on lawns he 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 latch can not access so 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 no to contact then what to do 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.000
 everything engineering to achieve 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.950
 make the call have knox ap start 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.430
 a conversation as if to start a conversation 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.649
 talk and play the part of connecting another 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.379
 thing that also happened was called g 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.809
 feels if I played here 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:09.890
 connection information that I just got 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.890
 work also works and 6 2 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.570
 I tried several methods have restore 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.939
 around the globe and tried to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.549
 ayrton I just needed to leave the account 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.509
 gmail but every time the longha go 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.689
 the club account on any cell phone 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.450
 he hangs up again then what was that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.619
 I discovered that I discovered that we 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.430
 settings 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.340
 specifically on the telephone part and 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.259
 lock it also fought 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.579
 and that was the key point for 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.899
 discover the error that is happening in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.600
 apple software 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.820
 at the time she created a block list 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.860
 contacts I've never put into the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.930
 my life then the only way I 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.590
 to have access to my 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.450
 contacts to my information and even 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.079
 receive calls is incredible that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 it looks like my iphone it was not 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.150
 receiving connections with huge delay 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 so when I looked, it was just the message 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.790
 of voice 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040
 was telling you to receive a message from 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.599
 if the person leaves your message and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 logical because the message was 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.290
 It took me 48 hours to get my 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.879
 appliance 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.629
 the first thing I advise you to do is 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.900
 do is change the locking time of the 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.120
 he is on average one minute 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 which is the factory default one man of the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.959
 and does not change for five years. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.880
 minutes because this is a process that 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.630
 it will require a lot of patience to open 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.970
 here you can see it is already happening in 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.440
 average almost one minute and has not yet opened 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.269
 the door in the lock 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.269
 Let's wait a little longer. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.160
 sometimes 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.470
 has not opened yet let's wait another one 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.470
 little 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.280
 it's been 42 minutes has not opened yet 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.510
 Like I said, you're going to have to have 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:49.659
 a lot of patience to fix goes 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.709
 this morning trying to correct and 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:59.060
 I started my process there at 10:30 p.m. 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:04.269
 I finished at 3.20 in the morning because 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.269
 on average to estoril and includes 23 contacts 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.140
 It's a problem the topic I have one 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:30.830
 season and since 2011 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.500
 I started with iphone 2g 3g and 3gs and 4 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.040
 while the 5 50's and had never seen 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.040
 nothing like 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.380
 That's why we have to police. 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.120
 I'm going to say something about it, is not it? 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.540
 locking everything but not succeeding in 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.920
 some specific devices like you 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.840
 can see we will spend almost three 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.750
 minutes and not yet opened the part 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.440
 blocking but is already opening a time 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.440
 little more patience 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.430
 open then as you can see there 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.219
 This list of contacts here that I never 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.490
 I put it in the list of mounted locks 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:44.889
 with ddd 51 worth stressing that only ddd 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:48.849
 8147 of 181 from other countries 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:51.460
 also available here plus 53 00 00 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.770
 then it is a totally random order and 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.419
 who never had access that we have 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:01.539
 what to do in this case you will have to edit 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.860
 unlock and unlock this even a 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.990
 for one 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.789
 It's worth stressing to you that every 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.840
 unlock this mode on average four 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.250
 minutes 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.139
 so I will not be filming here 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.150
 four minutes of locking each 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.909
 them because I do it now in the 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.710
 process another device 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.310
 but there it is the tip who has the 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.300
 same problem just do this test no 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.370
 I got 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.409
 the other way that I also discovered 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.180
 do this unblocking that was not 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.349
 I was very successful but some people 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.900
 may have is to change between contacts and 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:38.139
 calendars of the settings 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:42.250
 new ones that are scared favorites and recent 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.810
 you hide these two options and some 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.060
 cases back to work 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.060
 to help you with the image
