could do this video for you guys has a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.179 
could do this video for you guys has a
higher<00:01:09.330> fire<00:01:09.630> rate<00:01:09.869> practically<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.680> fast<00:01:11.010> as

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
higher fire rate practically as fast as

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
higher fire rate practically as fast as
you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.430> fire<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.790> weapon<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.510> fire

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you can fire this weapon it will fire

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
you can fire this weapon it will fire
and<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.409> even<00:01:13.740> better<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:14.070> using<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and that's even better when using a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
and that's even better when using a
Kimbo<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.420> fire<00:01:15.689> off<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.110> many

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Kimbo you can just fire off so many

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
Kimbo you can just fire off so many
bullets<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.920> quickly<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:18.240> has<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.810> high

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
bullets so quickly it has very high

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
bullets so quickly it has very high
recall<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.950> quite<00:01:20.159> predictable<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
recall but it's quite predictable and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399 
recall but it's quite predictable and
we're<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> detail<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.290> bit

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
we're going to detail in that little bit

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
we're going to detail in that little bit
later<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> video<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.549> higher<00:01:23.970> damage<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
later in the video a higher damage to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
later in the video a higher damage to
shot<00:01:24.900> kill<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.320> close<00:01:25.560> range<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> only<00:01:26.369> a

some horrendous recall very higher to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
some horrendous recall very higher to

the top right-hand corner both visually

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.389 
the top right-hand corner both visually
and<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.390> terms<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> accuracy<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.920> shot<00:01:50.220> will

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
and in terms of accuracy your shot will

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.710 
and in terms of accuracy your shot will
creep<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> top<00:01:51.270> right-hand<00:01:51.509> corner

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
creep up to the top right-hand corner

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.749 
creep up to the top right-hand corner
into<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> hits<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.530> ceiling<00:01:52.979> vertically<00:01:53.579> then

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
into it hits a ceiling vertically then

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.700 
into it hits a ceiling vertically then
it<00:01:54.180> won't<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.570> any<00:01:54.600> higher<00:01:55.049> bit<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> still

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
it won't go any higher bit it still

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
it won't go any higher bit it still
might<00:01:55.890> change<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.369> bit<00:01:56.490> horizontally

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
might change a little bit horizontally

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
might change a little bit horizontally
so<00:01:58.140> anyway<00:01:58.500> I've<00:01:58.619> set<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.189> scenario

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so anyway I've set up a little scenario

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
so anyway I've set up a little scenario
in<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.880> next<00:02:00.149> clip<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:01.049> me

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
in this next clip where you can see me

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
in this next clip where you can see me
shooting<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.710> gun<00:02:01.920> full<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:02.759> oh<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.210> this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
shooting the gun full or oh and this

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.270 
shooting the gun full or oh and this
will<00:02:03.509> show<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.960> natural<00:02:04.469> recoil<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
will show you the natural recoil of the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
will show you the natural recoil of the
gun<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> top<00:02:06.540> right<00:02:06.719> hand<00:02:06.899> corner

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
gun so it's to the top right hand corner

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
gun so it's to the top right hand corner
that<00:02:07.680> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.979> hits<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> ceiling<00:02:08.610> where<00:02:08.879> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that kind of hits the ceiling where it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180 
that kind of hits the ceiling where it
won't<00:02:09.149> go<00:02:09.300> any<00:02:09.330> higher<00:02:09.690> whoever<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.830> with

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
won't go any higher whoever with with

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100 
won't go any higher whoever with with
the<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.610> stick<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.239> actually<00:02:12.360> control

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the right stick you can actually control

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.910 
the right stick you can actually control
the<00:02:13.170> recoil

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the recoil

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.559 
the recoil
and<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.340> start<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.670> controlled<00:02:15.180> weapon

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
and you can start to controlled weapon

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.720 
and you can start to controlled weapon
so<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.110> second<00:02:16.620> clip<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.640> I

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
so there in that second clip that I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.190 
so there in that second clip that I
fired<00:02:18.030> I've<00:02:18.239> controlled<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.840> pulled<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
fired I've controlled it I pulled the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.589 
fired I've controlled it I pulled the
right<00:02:19.380> stick<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:20.940> left<00:02:21.180> hand

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
right stick down and to the left hand

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.510 
right stick down and to the left hand
side<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.870> little<00:02:22.110> bit<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> actually<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.130> can

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
side a little bit and actually you can

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.800 
side a little bit and actually you can
see<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> bullets<00:02:24.090> they<00:02:24.270> are<00:02:24.390> actually<00:02:24.540> in

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
see the bullets they are actually in

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.320 
see the bullets they are actually in
quite<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> close<00:02:25.500> range<00:02:25.860> together<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:26.910> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
quite a close range together so if you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.510 
quite a close range together so if you
can<00:02:27.540> control<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.200> recoil<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.800> becomes<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.340> lot

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
can control the recoil it becomes a lot

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.010 
can control the recoil it becomes a lot
better<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.360> are<00:02:30.569> going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.810> use<00:02:30.900> this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
better so if you are going to use this

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.320 
better so if you are going to use this
gun<00:02:31.290> don't<00:02:31.980> just<00:02:32.220> fire<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.520> as<00:02:32.760> far<00:02:32.910> as<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> can

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
gun don't just fire it as far as you can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.510 
gun don't just fire it as far as you can
and<00:02:33.480> hope<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.870> kill<00:02:34.080> actually<00:02:34.590> try<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
and hope for a kill actually try it and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.670 
and hope for a kill actually try it and
control<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.480> recoil<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.560> you'll

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
control the recoil and I think you'll

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.290 
control the recoil and I think you'll
find<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> lot<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> success<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.120> one

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
find you have a lot of success so one

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.180 
find you have a lot of success so one
more<00:02:39.450> time<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.739> really

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
more time here you can see the really

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250 
more time here you can see the really
bad<00:02:41.310> recall<00:02:41.790> high<00:02:42.000> into<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.300> riot<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:43.080> then

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
bad recall high into the riot but then

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.839 
bad recall high into the riot but then
try<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.590> control<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.160> little<00:02:44.190> bit<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.760> you

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
try and control it a little bit and you

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.490 
try and control it a little bit and you
can<00:02:44.880> get<00:02:45.120> your<00:02:45.239> bullet<00:02:45.510> spread<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.959> lot<00:02:46.230> tighter

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
can get your bullet spread a lot tighter

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.870 
can get your bullet spread a lot tighter
together<00:02:46.739> which<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.280> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.519> end<00:02:47.640> up<00:02:47.700> in

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
together which is going to end up in

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390 
together which is going to end up in
more<00:02:48.180> accuracy<00:02:48.600> for<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:50.370> are

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
more accuracy for you so there are

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.949 
more accuracy for you so there are
actually<00:02:50.730> only<00:02:50.910> two<00:02:51.209> attachments<00:02:51.870> available

so<00:03:10.410> I'm<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.620> bad<00:03:10.769> option<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.250> try<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.489> out<00:03:11.610> if

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so I'm not a bad option to try it out if

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.070

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
I would go for a Kimbo because if you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.250 
I would go for a Kimbo because if you
actually<00:03:17.370> use<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.910> say<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.359> have<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.600> sniper

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
actually use this say we have a sniper

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.620 
actually use this say we have a sniper
rifle<00:03:19.859> if<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.190> go<00:03:20.340> quick<00:03:20.640> draw<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.239> akimbo
