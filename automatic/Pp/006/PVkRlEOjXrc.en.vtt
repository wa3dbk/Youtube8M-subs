were<00:01:23.260> pulled<00:01:23.560> in<00:01:23.740> these<00:01:23.950> two<00:01:24.280> sides<00:01:24.610> lines<00:01:25.479> up

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
were pulled in these two sides lines up

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.630 
were pulled in these two sides lines up
with<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.290> holes<00:01:26.530> that<00:01:26.770> were<00:01:26.920> drilled<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.490> it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
with the holes that were drilled in it

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.750 
with the holes that were drilled in it
rich<00:01:27.880> license<00:01:28.420> this<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.050> exact<00:01:29.470> size<00:01:29.770> that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
rich license this is the exact size that

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.230 
rich license this is the exact size that
it<00:01:30.850> should<00:01:31.090> be<00:01:31.300> which<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.320> pretty<00:01:32.560> close

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it should be which is pretty close

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.950 
it should be which is pretty close
considering<00:01:34.240> how<00:01:34.870> different<00:01:35.650> these<00:01:35.800> two<00:01:35.860> are

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
considering how different these two are

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.800 
considering how different these two are
so<00:01:37.960> we've<00:01:38.530> got<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.770> do<00:01:38.890> today<00:01:39.430> then<00:01:39.790> is<00:01:40.060> work<00:01:40.570> on

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
so we've got to do today then is work on

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.860 
so we've got to do today then is work on
getting<00:01:41.280> tacking<00:01:42.280> tack<00:01:42.700> welding<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.330> couple

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
getting tacking tack welding in a couple

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.040 
getting tacking tack welding in a couple
spots<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.830> hold<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.400> place<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.630> pulls<00:01:46.810> it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
spots to hold it in place so it pulls it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.080 
spots to hold it in place so it pulls it
forward<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.860> holds<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.670> right<00:01:48.850> width

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
forward and holds it the right width

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.250 
forward and holds it the right width
just<00:01:49.390> tack<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.320> into<00:01:50.620> place<00:01:51.900> then<00:01:52.900> we're<00:01:53.170> gonna

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
just tack it into place then we're gonna

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.710 
just tack it into place then we're gonna
work<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.860> rear<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.430> get<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.760> why<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
work on the rear and get it why the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.140 
work on the rear and get it why the
width<00:01:56.159> taken<00:01:57.159> care<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.610> pull<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.970> together

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
width taken care of and pull it together

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.390 
width taken care of and pull it together
so<00:01:58.600> they've<00:01:58.750> got<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.050> right<00:01:59.230> width<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.159> then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
so they've got the right width and then

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.230 
so they've got the right width and then
we're<00:02:00.550> going<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.730> start<00:02:00.970> mounting

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240
