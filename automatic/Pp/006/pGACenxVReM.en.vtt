path if you have trouble doing the jumps

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.650 
path if you have trouble doing the jumps
some<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> jumps<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.740> little<00:00:32.040> tougher

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
some of the jumps are a little tougher

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.010 
some of the jumps are a little tougher
you<00:00:34.170> need<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> crouch<00:00:34.649> jump<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.070> some<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.280> them

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
you need to crouch jump for some of them

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.250

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
but go to this corner if you do have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.040 
but go to this corner if you do have
trouble<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> jumps<00:00:41.030> just<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.540> Sputnik

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
trouble as the jumps just use Sputnik

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.639 
trouble as the jumps just use Sputnik
the<00:00:43.559> skull<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.789> nade<00:00:44.969> jump<00:00:45.000> up

the skull and you get your nade jump up

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
the skull and you get your nade jump up
but<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.829> should<00:00:47.010> shoot<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.550> those<00:00:47.730> jackals<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but you should shoot at those jackals to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.330 
but you should shoot at those jackals to
clear<00:00:48.719> those<00:00:48.840> guys<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.660> then<00:00:51.660> three

up onto this roof and then we want to go

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.600 
up onto this roof and then we want to go
over<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:22.310> creep<00:01:23.310> down

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
over here and you want to go creep down

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
over here and you want to go creep down
to<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> edge<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> checkpoint

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to the edge here to get the checkpoint

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.969 
to the edge here to get the checkpoint
and<00:01:25.439> that'll<00:01:25.710> spawn<00:01:25.979> everybody<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.549> area

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
and that'll spawn everybody in this area

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.760 
and that'll spawn everybody in this area
and<00:01:29.479> usually<00:01:30.479> pops<00:01:30.720> faster<00:01:31.290> than<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and usually pops faster than that but

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.670 
and usually pops faster than that but
there<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.610> checkpoint<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:34.259> two

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
there it is checkpoint and there's two

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.410 
there it is checkpoint and there's two
snipers<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> distance<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
snipers and the distance there so you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.880 
snipers and the distance there so you
want<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:36.720> those<00:01:36.840> guys<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
want to take those guys out and I have

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.530 
want to take those guys out and I have
the<00:01:37.979> Scarab<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.520> obviously<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the Scarab going on obviously to make it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
the Scarab going on obviously to make it
way<00:01:39.720> easier<00:01:40.430> take<00:01:41.430> out<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> drones

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
