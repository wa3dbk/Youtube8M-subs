00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.300 
of protein in your hair it's very easy
to<00:01:54.420> recover<00:01:54.720> from<00:01:54.990> dry<00:01:55.290> hair<00:01:55.590> by<00:01:55.799> simply

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to recover from dry hair by simply

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
to recover from dry hair by simply
incorporating<00:01:56.579> more<00:01:57.090> moisturizing<00:01:57.810> products

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
incorporating more moisturizing products

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.429 
incorporating more moisturizing products
but<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.549> most<00:02:00.090> cases<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.049> hard<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
but in most cases if it's hard for you

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.360 
but in most cases if it's hard for you
to<00:02:01.500> recover<00:02:01.890> from

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
to recover from

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.220 
to recover from
it's<00:02:02.550> usually<00:02:02.730> because<00:02:03.480> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> loss<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
it's usually because you have a loss of

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.650 
it's usually because you have a loss of
protein<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:05.400> second<00:02:05.880> tip<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.120> that<00:02:06.330> you

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
protein so my second tip is that you

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.050 
protein so my second tip is that you
start<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.200> uh<00:02:07.230> if<00:02:07.770> coconut<00:02:08.310> oil<00:02:08.490> isn't<00:02:08.820> enough

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
start to uh if coconut oil isn't enough

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.940 
start to uh if coconut oil isn't enough
for<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.570> start<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.080> actually<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.740> deep

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
for you you start to actually do deep

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.850 
for you you start to actually do deep
conditioning<00:02:11.490> treatments<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.180> eggs<00:02:12.570> or

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
conditioning treatments with eggs or

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.350 
conditioning treatments with eggs or
hydrolyzed<00:02:13.860> protein<00:02:14.460> now<00:02:15.030> there's<00:02:15.270> a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
hydrolyzed protein now there's a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940 
hydrolyzed protein now there's a
difference<00:02:15.780> between<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.260> protein<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
difference between the protein and the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100 
difference between the protein and the
two<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.640> with<00:02:17.880> eggs<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.720> protein

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
two because with eggs the protein

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.350 
two because with eggs the protein
molecules<00:02:19.710> are<00:02:19.890> larger<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.490> only<00:02:20.700> bound<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
molecules are larger which only bound to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.630 
molecules are larger which only bound to
the<00:02:21.480> outside<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.020> your<00:02:22.320> hair<00:02:22.530> strand<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.460> it's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the outside of your hair strand so it's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
the outside of your hair strand so it's
not<00:02:23.760> very<00:02:24.000> intensive<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.350> more<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
not very intensive it's just more of a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
not very intensive it's just more of a
light<00:02:26.250> protein<00:02:26.880> treatment<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.110> an

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
light protein treatment but for an

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 
light protein treatment but for an
intense<00:02:28.590> protein<00:02:29.040> treatment<00:02:29.520> where<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
intense protein treatment where the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.610 
intense protein treatment where the
protein<00:02:30.240> molecules<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.930> small<00:02:31.170> enough<00:02:31.320> to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
protein molecules are small enough to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.010 
protein molecules are small enough to
migrate<00:02:32.040> inside<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.760> your<00:02:32.910> hair<00:02:33.150> strands<00:02:33.510> you

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
migrate inside of your hair strands you

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.470 
migrate inside of your hair strands you
have<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.500> use<00:02:34.650> hydrolyzed<00:02:35.340> protein<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.390> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
have to use hydrolyzed protein so you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.930 
have to use hydrolyzed protein so you
can<00:02:36.810> use<00:02:36.960> keratin<00:02:37.560> or<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.160> can<00:02:38.400> use<00:02:38.670> wheat

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
can use keratin or you can use wheat

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.090 
can use keratin or you can use wheat
protein<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.050> highly<00:02:40.410> suggest<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.980> use

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
protein so I highly suggest that you use

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.030 
protein so I highly suggest that you use
hydrolyzed<00:02:41.850> protein<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.660> treatment<00:02:43.530> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
hydrolyzed protein as a treatment to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.060 
hydrolyzed protein as a treatment to
help<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.430> recover<00:02:44.760> from<00:02:45.090> damaged<00:02:45.630> hair<00:02:46.070> now

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
help you recover from damaged hair now

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.590 
help you recover from damaged hair now
the<00:02:47.130> third<00:02:47.460> tip<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.850> I'm<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.270> suggest

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the third tip that I'm going to suggest

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.290 
the third tip that I'm going to suggest
also<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:50.010> make<00:02:50.190> sure<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.610> limit<00:02:51.150> your

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
also is to make sure you just limit your

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.240 
also is to make sure you just limit your
use<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.570> heat<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.440> you're<00:02:52.620> using<00:02:52.920> or

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
use of heat that you're using or

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
use of heat that you're using or
chemicals<00:02:53.760> at<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.420> point<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.990> wouldn't<00:02:55.290> even

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
chemicals at this point I wouldn't even

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.710 
chemicals at this point I wouldn't even
say<00:02:55.680> limit<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.220> will<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.550> say<00:02:56.700> eliminate<00:02:57.480> all

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
say limit I will just say eliminate all

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.960 
say limit I will just say eliminate all
of<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.230> because<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.130> have<00:02:59.340> damaged<00:02:59.730> hair<00:02:59.910> and

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
of it because you have damaged hair and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.030 
of it because you have damaged hair and
you<00:03:00.240> have<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> lot<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.660> recovering<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> do<00:03:01.560> so

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
you have a lot of recovering to do so
