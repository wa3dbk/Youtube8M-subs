 quality beef as I can 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 in this case I'm using a mashed pizza 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.020
 or crush potatoes let's fry the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 about 15 minutes until the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.199
 Ground beef change color like here 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.820
 it looks 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 Meanwhile we put in the blender 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.650
 the tomato the onion the teeth of 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 garlic we cover and we grind 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.350
 add the grind to the pan 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.660
 we stir and cover it ten minutes 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.810

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.720
 freshly ground the oregano we stir and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.820
 we check the point of salt we cover and 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.190
 we let everything cook around 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 five minutes and spent five 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.290
 minutes we see that the ingredients are 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.110
 fully integrated we turn off and 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.000
 We reserve on the other hand in a pot with 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.610
 about three or four liters of water 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.650
 boiling let's add the sheets of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.560
 laurel a tablespoon of salt and the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 spaghetti we move it a little so that it does not 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.710
 stick when it starts to boil 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.970
 we have approximately 10 12 minutes 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.490
 After this time we tried the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.090
 spaghetti to check that they are 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.640
 cooked to our liking 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.979
 we remove the water from the spaghetti and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.009
 We take it to a saucepan that is 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.500
 fire where we have added a spoonful 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.469
 of oil and a little butter what 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 we stir up to integrate it well once 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.600
 that is well integrated we can already 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.959
 serve on a plate we serve the spaghetti 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.959
