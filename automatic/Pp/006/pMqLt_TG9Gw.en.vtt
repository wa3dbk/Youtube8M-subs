there's a bunch of different ways to do
it<00:06:01.870> but<00:06:01.900> you<00:06:02.530> can<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:05.500> can<00:06:05.710> put<00:06:05.980> um<00:06:06.300> like<00:06:07.300> a

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
it but you can you can put um like a

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.540 
it but you can you can put um like a
bunch<00:06:07.630> of<00:06:07.750> different<00:06:08.050> pom-poms<00:06:08.500> or<00:06:08.980> whatever

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
bunch of different pom-poms or whatever

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.790 
bunch of different pom-poms or whatever
shapes<00:06:10.030> pieces<00:06:10.570> stuff<00:06:10.720> like<00:06:10.870> that<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.200> then

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
shapes pieces stuff like that and then

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.950 
shapes pieces stuff like that and then
you<00:06:11.950> sort<00:06:12.220> them<00:06:12.400> out<00:06:12.520> into<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:12.970> colors<00:06:13.300> so<00:06:13.690> I

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
you sort them out into the colors so I

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.420 
you sort them out into the colors so I
thought<00:06:14.440> that<00:06:14.500> would<00:06:14.740> be<00:06:14.770> kind<00:06:14.860> of<00:06:15.100> fun<00:06:15.280> for

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
thought that would be kind of fun for

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.880 
thought that would be kind of fun for
something<00:06:15.760> to<00:06:15.850> do<00:06:16.000> I<00:06:16.840> don't<00:06:17.500> like<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.680> said<00:06:17.830> I
