from my understandings the Super Saiyan
God<00:01:40.409> hastens<00:01:40.920> mastered<00:01:41.610> inside<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.150> oneself

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
God hastens mastered inside of oneself

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.090 
God hastens mastered inside of oneself
making<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.780> almost<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> base<00:01:46.500> form<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
making it almost like a base form in a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
making it almost like a base form in a
way<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.060> turn<00:01:48.270> super<00:01:48.630> saying<00:01:48.869> it's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
way and then they turn super saying it's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.840 
way and then they turn super saying it's
not<00:01:49.229> anything<00:01:49.500> special<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.490> Super<00:01:50.820> Saiyan

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
not anything special of a Super Saiyan

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.389 
not anything special of a Super Saiyan
from<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.920> super

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
from what I know it's just a super

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.109 
from what I know it's just a super
saiyan<00:01:53.640> form<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.560> essentially<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.490> Super

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
saiyan form so it essentially is a Super

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.319 
saiyan form so it essentially is a Super
Saiyan<00:01:57.149> God<00:01:57.979> then<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.280> turn<00:01:59.520> Super<00:02:00.060> Saiyan

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
Saiyan God then you turn Super Saiyan

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.630 
Saiyan God then you turn Super Saiyan
that's<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> name<00:02:01.110> came<00:02:01.439> from<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:02.340> Super

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that's when the name came from now Super

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.810 
that's when the name came from now Super
Saiyan<00:02:02.880> God<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.360> isn't<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.670> proper<00:02:05.670> name

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Saiyan God to isn't really a proper name

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.310 
Saiyan God to isn't really a proper name
for<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.030> neither<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.450> ascended<00:02:06.869> Super

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
for this neither as ascended Super

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.710 
for this neither as ascended Super
Saiyan<00:02:07.560> God<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.069> said<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
Saiyan God like I said it's not a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
Saiyan God like I said it's not a
variation<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> Super<00:02:10.860> Saiyan<00:02:11.070> God<00:02:11.280> form

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
variation on the Super Saiyan God form

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.330 
variation on the Super Saiyan God form
the<00:02:11.730> Super<00:02:12.030> Saiyan<00:02:12.300> God<00:02:12.540> form<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:14.040> form

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the Super Saiyan God form is the form

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.830 
the Super Saiyan God form is the form
with<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.550> red<00:02:14.850> hair<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> separate

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
with the red hair at the separate

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.160 
with the red hair at the separate
transformation<00:02:16.770> um<00:02:17.750> then<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:18.960> make<00:02:19.140> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
transformation um then let's make it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.350 
transformation um then let's make it
makes<00:02:19.440> us<00:02:19.590> all<00:02:19.800> very<00:02:19.830> interesting<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.970> well<00:02:21.210> as

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
makes us all very interesting as well as

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.600 
makes us all very interesting as well as
the<00:02:21.510> true<00:02:21.810> super<00:02:22.140> saying<00:02:22.380> God<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.400> not

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610

and the pure Super Saiyan God but in

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.640 
and the pure Super Saiyan God but in
reality<00:02:30.570> that's<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.170> actually<00:02:31.350> what<00:02:31.590> they

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
reality that's not actually what they

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.830 
reality that's not actually what they
are<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.940> saying<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.270> can't<00:02:33.330> call<00:02:33.720> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
are I'm not saying you can't call it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.880 
are I'm not saying you can't call it
that<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.560> said<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.830> got

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
that because like I said you got

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.430 
that because like I said you got
whatever<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.910> because<00:02:36.900> there<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.290> no

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
whatever you want because there is no

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.930 
whatever you want because there is no
official<00:02:37.680> name<00:02:37.950> at<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.190> moment<00:02:38.370> maybe<00:02:38.670> when

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
official name at this moment maybe when

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.360 
official name at this moment maybe when
hopefully<00:02:39.840> before<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.200> xenoverse<00:02:40.680> dlc<00:02:41.160> comes

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
hopefully before the xenoverse dlc comes

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.040 
hopefully before the xenoverse dlc comes
out<00:02:41.520> they're<00:02:41.700> gonna<00:02:41.850> give<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> name<00:02:42.300> we'll

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
out they're gonna give it a name we'll

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.170 
out they're gonna give it a name we'll
get<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> name<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.610> know<00:02:44.700> maybe<00:02:44.940> they

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
get a name then but you know maybe they

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
get a name then but you know maybe they
won't<00:02:45.300> call<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.600> anything<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.110> mean<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.830> I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
won't call it anything I mean that I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.440 
won't call it anything I mean that I
think<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> feel<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.520> they<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:48.150> because

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
think I feel like they have to because

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.000 
think I feel like they have to because
xenoverse<00:02:49.200> character<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.680> gonna<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:49.980> a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
xenoverse character is gonna be a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.550 
xenoverse character is gonna be a
separate<00:02:50.370> character<00:02:51.020> not<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.350> character

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
separate character not just a character

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.320 
separate character not just a character
variation<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.430> I'm<00:02:53.520> gonna<00:02:53.910> find<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.270> very

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
variation so I'm gonna find it very

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.310 
variation so I'm gonna find it very
interesting<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.810> see<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:54.990> they<00:02:55.050> have<00:02:55.290> on

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
interesting to see what they have on

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.090 
interesting to see what they have on
that<00:02:55.560> game<00:02:55.830> um<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.410> I'm<00:02:58.560> saying<00:02:58.770> from<00:02:58.950> my

that game um but like I'm saying from my

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.740 
that game um but like I'm saying from my
understanding<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.850> know<00:02:59.970> what<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.570> said
