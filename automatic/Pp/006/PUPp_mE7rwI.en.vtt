hi<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.550> just<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.030> quick<00:00:03.210> overview<00:00:03.540> of

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hi guys this is just a quick overview of

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:14.690 
hi guys this is just a quick overview of
what<00:00:04.770> I've<00:00:04.859> been<00:00:05.040> doing<00:00:05.310> recently<00:00:13.700> started

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
what I've been doing recently started

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.680 
what I've been doing recently started
off<00:00:14.820> wanting<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.269> book<00:00:15.420> reader<00:00:17.210> something<00:00:18.210> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
off wanting a book reader something I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.980 
off wanting a book reader something I
thought<00:00:19.500> was<00:00:19.650> completely<00:00:19.770> natural<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.990> move

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
thought was completely natural to move

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.370 
thought was completely natural to move
around<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.439> text<00:00:22.800> smoothly<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.269> fast<00:00:27.349> when<00:00:28.349> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
around the text smoothly and fast when I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.030 
around the text smoothly and fast when I
finally<00:00:28.830> worked<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.220> how<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
finally worked out how to do this I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.000 
finally worked out how to do this I
found<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:32.880> quite<00:00:33.149> easy<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
found that it was quite easy to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
found that it was quite easy to
manipulate<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:36.380> actually<00:00:37.610> use<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.989> go

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
manipulate and actually use I can go

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
manipulate and actually use I can go
through<00:00:40.350> documents<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.370> way<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> feel

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
through documents in a way that I feel

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.920 
through documents in a way that I feel
like<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.629> should<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.290> able<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:47.360> what<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> needed

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
like I should be able to what I needed

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.549 
like I should be able to what I needed
was<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.190> able<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> choose<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> resolution

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
was to be able to choose the resolution

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.819 
was to be able to choose the resolution
so<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.640> lower<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.660> raise<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.199> resolution

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so I can lower or raise the resolution

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.389 
so I can lower or raise the resolution
as<00:00:56.250> required<00:00:57.829> everything<00:00:58.829> still<00:00:59.039> looks<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
as required everything still looks the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.660 
as required everything still looks the
same<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.539> better<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.020> farms<00:01:01.670> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
same but I get better for farms so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
same but I get better for farms so
obviously<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.700> battery<00:01:05.700> pack<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
obviously if I'm on a battery pack and I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
obviously if I'm on a battery pack and I
don't<00:01:07.200> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.860> waste<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.310> power<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.090> run<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
don't want to waste my power I run in a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
don't want to waste my power I run in a
power<00:01:10.080> saving<00:01:10.590> mode

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 

now<00:01:15.390> even<00:01:15.600> though<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.470> whole<00:01:16.680> computer<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
now even though the whole computer is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.270 
now even though the whole computer is
running<00:01:17.460> slower<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.380> can<00:01:19.380> still<00:01:19.620> do<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.920> work<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
running slower I can still do the work I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:32.249 
running slower I can still do the work I
want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.850> exactly<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:22.140> before

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.090 

still<00:01:32.860> not<00:01:33.040> perfect<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:35.229> I<00:01:35.259> also<00:01:35.560> wanted<00:01:36.040> to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
still not perfect what I also wanted to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.420 
still not perfect what I also wanted to
be<00:01:36.310> able<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.640> do<00:01:36.790> was<00:01:37.360> take<00:01:38.200> notes<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:38.830> draw

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
be able to do was take notes and draw

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.389 
be able to do was take notes and draw
things<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.320> end<00:01:41.350> I've<00:01:41.649> got<00:01:41.680> myself<00:01:42.159> a

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
things so to that end I've got myself a

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.850 
things so to that end I've got myself a
quick<00:01:42.549> little<00:01:42.880> application<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.350> can<00:01:44.619> say

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
quick little application where I can say

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.990 
quick little application where I can say
what<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.130> want

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000 

you're<00:01:56.630> going<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.930> not<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.230> performance<00:01:57.800> back

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
you're going to not the performance back

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.090 
you're going to not the performance back
up

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.980 

now<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.180> taken<00:02:02.480> a<00:02:02.540> little<00:02:02.780> at<00:02:02.870> a<00:02:02.960> time

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
now this is taken a little at a time

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.170 
now this is taken a little at a time
because<00:02:03.440> I've<00:02:04.010> got<00:02:04.280> basically<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:05.000> last

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
because I've got basically the last

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.360 
because I've got basically the last
three<00:02:05.510> weeks<00:02:05.540> worth<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:06.050> notes<00:02:06.350> what<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.130> just

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
three weeks worth of notes what I just

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.710 
three weeks worth of notes what I just
wrote<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.090> corner

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
wrote is in the corner

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.470 
wrote is in the corner
and<00:02:09.130> everything<00:02:10.130> I've<00:02:10.250> written<00:02:10.369> between<00:02:11.060> now

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
and everything I've written between now

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.340 
and everything I've written between now
and<00:02:12.130> when<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.220> first<00:02:13.280> wrote<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> application

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
and when I first wrote the application

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.600 
and when I first wrote the application
is<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.750> same<00:02:17.780> as<00:02:18.110> before<00:02:18.610> it's

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610
