because<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.000> sound<00:00:40.270> one<00:00:41.140> thing<00:00:41.320> about<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
because of the sound one thing about the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.370 
because of the sound one thing about the
mouthpiece<00:00:43.060> is<00:00:43.210> today<00:00:43.570> in<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.750> United<00:00:44.110> States

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
mouthpiece is today in the United States

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.830 
mouthpiece is today in the United States
it's<00:00:44.590> hard<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.860> get<00:00:45.010> really<00:00:45.190> good<00:00:45.430> quality

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's hard to get really good quality

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.260 
it's hard to get really good quality
rubber<00:00:46.840> because<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.950> think<00:00:48.700> that<00:00:48.880> there's<00:00:49.120> some

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
rubber because I think that there's some

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.240 
rubber because I think that there's some
kind<00:00:49.450> of<00:00:49.510> Lord<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:49.900> is<00:00:50.050> it's<00:00:50.710> not<00:00:50.890> good<00:00:51.070> for<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
kind of Lord it is it's not good for the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.850 
kind of Lord it is it's not good for the
ecology<00:00:51.820> but<00:00:52.090> these<00:00:52.690> these<00:00:53.110> mouthpieces<00:00:53.560> are

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
ecology but these these mouthpieces are

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.500 
ecology but these these mouthpieces are
made<00:00:54.070> out<00:00:54.250> of<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.550> hundred<00:00:54.850> percent<00:00:54.940> rubber

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
made out of a hundred percent rubber

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.630 
made out of a hundred percent rubber
which<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.050> really<00:00:56.590> good<00:00:56.770> that's<00:00:56.920> how<00:00:57.100> all<00:00:57.130> the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640

it<00:02:20.090> has<00:02:20.270> many<00:02:20.569> different<00:02:20.959> faces<00:02:21.349> also<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.280> can

too much at a high end on it and you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.070 
too much at a high end on it and you
know<00:03:01.489> some<00:03:01.970> people<00:03:02.120> were<00:03:02.360> saying<00:03:02.600> wow<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.989> a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.600
