00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
guess another specialty attack pocket

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.160 
guess another specialty attack pocket
and<00:00:34.520> been<00:00:35.520> working<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.750> terms

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and been working a lot on them in terms

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.619 
and been working a lot on them in terms
of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> ideas<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> pocket<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> type

associated<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> add<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> their<00:00:43.649> game

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
associated with or can add to their game

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
associated with or can add to their game
