00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hey this is Tim with OD I thought today

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey this is Tim with OD I thought today
I<00:00:03.060> would<00:00:03.300> go<00:00:03.449> over<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> product<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.500> we<00:00:04.650> have

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
I would go over a product that we have

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.470 
I would go over a product that we have
on<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.130> unity<00:00:05.490> asset<00:00:05.609> store<00:00:05.819> called<00:00:06.270> mount

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
on the unity asset store called mount

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.600 
on the unity asset store called mount
points<00:00:06.870> what<00:00:07.560> mount<00:00:07.740> points<00:00:08.010> allows<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.490> to

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
points what mount points allows you to

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
points what mount points allows you to
do<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.940> connect<00:00:09.300> objects<00:00:09.750> together<00:00:09.870> both<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
do is connect objects together both the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.249 
do is connect objects together both the
Edit<00:00:10.650> time<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.130> run<00:00:11.309> time<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.690> works<00:00:12.990> they

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
Edit time and run time and it works they

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.079 
Edit time and run time and it works they
work<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.559> like<00:00:13.740> magnets<00:00:14.219> basically<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.910> have

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
work so like magnets basically you have

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.689 
work so like magnets basically you have
a<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:16.020> mount<00:00:16.260> point<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.710> another<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.310> object

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
a one mount point on another one object

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.980 
a one mount point on another one object
another<00:00:18.000> mount<00:00:18.210> point<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.570> another<00:00:18.810> object

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
another mount point on another object

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.810 
another mount point on another object
and<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.619> they<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:19.890> close<00:00:20.130> together<00:00:20.340> they<00:00:20.640> can

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and as they get close together they can

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.849 
and as they get close together they can
snap<00:00:21.119> together<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> great<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
snap together and this is a great way to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.439 
snap together and this is a great way to
make<00:00:23.279> sure<00:00:23.310> things<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.880> were<00:00:24.029> rented

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
make sure things that were rented

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.179 
make sure things that were rented
correctly<00:00:24.990> make<00:00:25.289> sure<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.710> parented

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
correctly make sure things are parented

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.189 
correctly make sure things are parented
correctly<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.150> let<00:00:27.269> me<00:00:27.359> take<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.630> through<00:00:27.810> an

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
correctly so let me take you through an

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.439 
correctly so let me take you through an
example<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.699> our<00:00:29.910> male

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
example here so here I have our male

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.500 
example here so here I have our male
avatar<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.260> he<00:00:32.009> has<00:00:32.189> mount<00:00:32.700> points<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.239> him

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
avatar and he has mount points on him

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.060 
avatar and he has mount points on him
and<00:00:33.780> I've<00:00:33.930> went<00:00:34.230> ahead<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.559> created<00:00:34.890> three

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and I've went ahead and created three

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.470 
and I've went ahead and created three
mount<00:00:35.399> points<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.149> him<00:00:36.239> here

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
mount points and you can see him here

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
mount points and you can see him here
one<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.809> his<00:00:36.960> left<00:00:37.260> arm<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.920> his<00:00:38.070> head<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
one on his left arm one on his head and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.060 
one on his left arm one on his head and
one<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.239> his<00:00:39.420> hand<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.590> each<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> these

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
one in his hand and now each of these

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.940 
one in his hand and now each of these
mount<00:00:41.489> points<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.059> has<00:00:42.570> an<00:00:42.750> orientation

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
mount points actually has an orientation

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
mount points actually has an orientation
so<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.210> hand

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
so if we look at the one on this hand

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
so if we look at the one on this hand
for<00:00:45.840> example<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.440> sorry<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
for example I'm sorry if we look at the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
for example I'm sorry if we look at the
one<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> hand<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.469> blade<00:00:49.860> basically

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
one on this hand the blade basically

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
one on this hand the blade basically
let's<00:00:51.120> say<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> sword<00:00:51.690> or<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> dagger<00:00:52.170> would

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
let's say it's a sword or a dagger would

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
let's say it's a sword or a dagger would
come<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.750> blue<00:00:55.079> access<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
come out this what this blue access the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.819 
come out this what this blue access the
z-axis<00:00:55.920> right<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.350> helps

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
z-axis right here and so what that helps

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
z-axis right here and so what that helps
us<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.520> no<00:00:59.699> matter<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.270> way<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> weapon

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
us to do is no matter which way a weapon

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.319 
us to do is no matter which way a weapon
is<00:01:01.530> created<00:01:02.340> sometimes<00:01:02.789> I've<00:01:02.969> seen<00:01:03.180> them

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
is created sometimes I've seen them

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
is created sometimes I've seen them
created<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> blade<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.589> along<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> z

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
created with the blade going along the z

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
created with the blade going along the z
axis<00:01:05.700> great<00:01:06.060> sometimes<00:01:06.930> I've<00:01:07.049> seen<00:01:07.080> them

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
axis great sometimes I've seen them

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.780 
axis great sometimes I've seen them
created<00:01:07.650> where<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.830> blades<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.340> along<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
created where the blades going along the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.359 
created where the blades going along the
y<00:01:08.939> axis<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.570> no<00:01:09.720> matter<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> blade<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
y axis so no matter which way a blade is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.580 
y axis so no matter which way a blade is
created<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:12.960> sure<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> fits

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
created we can make sure that it fits

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
created we can make sure that it fits
our<00:01:13.799> avatar<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.450> position<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
our avatar in the right position in the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.100 
our avatar in the right position in the
right<00:01:16.200> orientation<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> let<00:01:18.720> me<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.930> ahead<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
right orientation so let me go ahead and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.600 
right orientation so let me go ahead and
give<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> an<00:01:19.470> example<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.070> here's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> sword

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
give you an example so here's a sword

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330 
give you an example so here's a sword
that<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.470> when<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.740> created<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that we have when it was created the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.249 
that we have when it was created the
creator<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> did<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> great<00:01:24.659> job<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
creator of it did a great job and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
creator of it did a great job and
created<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> origin<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> hilt<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> then

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
created the origin at the hilt and then

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
created the origin at the hilt and then
basically<00:01:28.170> created<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> blade<00:01:29.280> was

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
basically created so the blade was

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.480 
basically created so the blade was
running<00:01:30.509> down<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.079> z<00:01:31.320> axis<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
running down the z axis now again that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.640 
running down the z axis now again that
isn't<00:01:32.640> always<00:01:32.880> true<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.720> lots<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.320> assets

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
isn't always true we have lots of assets

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.289 
isn't always true we have lots of assets
that<00:01:34.829> we've<00:01:34.950> purchased<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> blade

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that we've purchased where the blade

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.780 
that we've purchased where the blade
goes<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> y-axis<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> origin<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
goes up the y-axis or the origin is in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
goes up the y-axis or the origin is in
the<00:01:38.909> center<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> challenge

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the center and that can make a challenge

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
the center and that can make a challenge
when<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.369> trying<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.390> be

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
when you're trying to basically be

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
when you're trying to basically be
consistent<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.829> character

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
consistent use it with your character

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
consistent use it with your character
but<00:01:44.880> let's<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.149> ahead<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.420> make<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.930> mount

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
but let's go ahead and make a mount

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.630 
but let's go ahead and make a mount
point<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.280> ahead<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> add<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
point for this so we go ahead and add a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.840 
point for this so we go ahead and add a
component

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.130 

and<00:01:53.320> let's<00:01:54.320> call<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.740> handle<00:01:58.180> okay<00:01:59.180> so<00:01:59.810> in

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
and let's call this handle okay so in

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.620 
and let's call this handle okay so in
this<00:02:00.409> case<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:01.729> case<00:02:01.790> like<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.270> said<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
this case in this case like I said the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.660 
this case in this case like I said the
creator<00:02:03.200> did<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.560> good<00:02:03.740> job<00:02:03.800> put<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.580> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
creator did a good job put it in the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.640 
creator did a good job put it in the
right<00:02:04.820> place<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:05.690> what<00:02:05.840> we're<00:02:06.020> gonna<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.470> is

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
right place but what we're gonna do is

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.169 
right place but what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:06.800> still<00:02:07.070> gonna<00:02:07.250> make<00:02:07.460> sure<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.820> on<00:02:08.000> our

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
we're still gonna make sure that on our

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.770 
we're still gonna make sure that on our
mount<00:02:08.479> point<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.320> blue<00:02:09.709> arrow<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.340> z-axis<00:02:11.240> is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
mount point the blue arrow the z-axis is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.810 
mount point the blue arrow the z-axis is
pointing<00:02:12.530> along<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.890> blade<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.550> I'm<00:02:13.700> gonna

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
pointing along the blade so I'm gonna

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.580 
pointing along the blade so I'm gonna
change<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> orientation<00:02:15.050> here<00:02:17.350> okay

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
change the orientation here okay

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.830 
change the orientation here okay
now<00:02:19.400> what<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:20.030> also<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.570> when<00:02:20.720> we're

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
now what we can also do is when we're

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.150 
now what we can also do is when we're
building<00:02:20.990> mount<00:02:21.290> points<00:02:21.620> as<00:02:21.709> we<00:02:21.830> could<00:02:22.010> tie

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
building mount points as we could tie

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.180 
building mount points as we could tie
mount<00:02:22.400> points<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.850> specific<00:02:23.330> bones<00:02:23.630> um<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:25.070> we

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
mount points to specific bones um and we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
mount points to specific bones um and we
can<00:02:25.340> set<00:02:25.580> some<00:02:25.790> other<00:02:25.940> things<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.390> we<00:02:26.600> don't

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
can set some other things that we don't

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.240 
can set some other things that we don't
need<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.020> do<00:02:27.170> here<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.709> sword<00:02:27.950> because

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
need to do here for the sword because

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.490 
need to do here for the sword because
it's<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.730> static<00:02:29.090> mesh<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:29.900> now<00:02:30.080> here

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it's just a static mesh but now here

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.979 
it's just a static mesh but now here
we've<00:02:30.650> got<00:02:30.860> our<00:02:31.130> mount<00:02:31.760> point<00:02:32.090> created<00:02:32.540> took

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
we've got our mount point created took

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.920 
we've got our mount point created took
all<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.170> what<00:02:33.680> five<00:02:33.890> seconds<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.420> let's<00:02:35.810> go

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
all of what five seconds and let's go

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.140 
all of what five seconds and let's go
ahead<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.170> lock<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.470> into<00:02:36.590> place<00:02:36.770> now<00:02:37.760> what

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
ahead and lock it into place now what

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.750 
ahead and lock it into place now what
will<00:02:38.300> happen<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:39.050> if<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.739> move<00:02:40.100> let's<00:02:40.459> say<00:02:40.580> our

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
will happen is if I move let's say our

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.990 
will happen is if I move let's say our
blade<00:02:41.209> was<00:02:41.570> rotated<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.550> go<00:02:43.700> ahead<00:02:43.820> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
blade was rotated if I go ahead and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.600 
blade was rotated if I go ahead and
rotate<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.540> blade<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.230> then<00:02:46.100> let's<00:02:46.340> say<00:02:46.459> we

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
rotate the blade and then let's say we

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.570 
rotate the blade and then let's say we
want<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.910> move<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.690> put<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.580> towards

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
want to move it and we put it towards

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.100 
want to move it and we put it towards
this<00:02:49.790> other<00:02:49.970> mount<00:02:50.330> point<00:02:50.630> what's<00:02:50.840> going<00:02:51.050> to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
this other mount point what's going to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.430 
this other mount point what's going to
happen<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.739> it's<00:02:52.130> going<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.790> snap<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:54.350> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
happen is it's going to snap to the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.050 
happen is it's going to snap to the
right<00:02:54.620> position<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> right<00:02:55.370> orientation

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
right position and the right orientation

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.000 
right position and the right orientation
and<00:02:56.209> again<00:02:56.480> imagine<00:02:57.320> you've<00:02:57.410> got<00:02:57.470> different

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
and again imagine you've got different

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.530 
and again imagine you've got different
weapons<00:02:58.370> created<00:02:58.640> by<00:02:58.850> different<00:02:59.209> people

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
weapons created by different people

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.360 
weapons created by different people
different<00:02:59.930> orientations<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.950> stuff

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
different orientations all that stuff

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.009 
different orientations all that stuff
it<00:03:01.580> doesn't<00:03:01.970> matter<00:03:02.120> mount<00:03:02.510> points<00:03:02.870> we'll

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
it doesn't matter mount points we'll

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.920 
it doesn't matter mount points we'll
make<00:03:03.230> sure<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:04.269> when<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.299> set<00:03:05.690> them<00:03:05.810> up

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
make sure that it when you set them up

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.660 
make sure that it when you set them up
that<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.350> always<00:03:06.530> connects<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.459> right

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
that it always connects to the right

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.690 
that it always connects to the right
spot<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.630> right<00:03:08.810> orientation<00:03:09.340> now<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:10.610> I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
spot and the right orientation now if I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.430 
spot and the right orientation now if I
play<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.269> what<00:03:11.480> will<00:03:11.600> happen<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:12.049> because

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
play this what will happen is because

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.280 
play this what will happen is because
that<00:03:12.650> right<00:03:13.070> hand<00:03:13.640> mount<00:03:14.090> point<00:03:14.480> was

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
that right hand mount point was

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.370 
that right hand mount point was
basically<00:03:16.070> attached<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> skeleton<00:03:17.380> then

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
basically attached to the skeleton then

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.380 
basically attached to the skeleton then
when<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:18.829> attached<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.579> sword<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
when we attached the sword to it the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.390 
when we attached the sword to it the
sword<00:03:20.630> now<00:03:20.810> gets<00:03:21.049> animated<00:03:21.709> as<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.190> see

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
sword now gets animated as you can see

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.780 
sword now gets animated as you can see
here<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.600> all<00:03:23.690> works<00:03:23.959> as<00:03:24.170> we'd<00:03:24.380> expect<00:03:24.790> now

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
here and it all works as we'd expect now

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.460 
here and it all works as we'd expect now
the<00:03:25.850> other<00:03:26.120> thing<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.390> we<00:03:26.600> can<00:03:26.780> do<00:03:26.959> let<00:03:27.260> me<00:03:27.290> go

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
the other thing that we can do let me go

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.080 
the other thing that we can do let me go
ahead<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.769> break<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.160> connection<00:03:28.400> no

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
ahead and break the connection no

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.539 
ahead and break the connection no
problem<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:29.600> pull<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.900> away<00:03:30.019> is<00:03:30.440> we<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.400> do

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
problem I just pull it away is we can do

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.240 
problem I just pull it away is we can do
this<00:03:31.670> at<00:03:31.850> run<00:03:32.060> time<00:03:32.090> as<00:03:32.480> well<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.100> let's<00:03:34.100> say<00:03:34.220> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
this at run time as well so let's say I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.340 
this at run time as well so let's say I
have<00:03:34.430> an<00:03:34.549> inventory<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.360> know<00:03:35.420> my<00:03:35.690> sword<00:03:35.989> is

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
have an inventory and I know my sword is

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.130 
have an inventory and I know my sword is
a<00:03:36.519> prefab<00:03:37.519> it's<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.000> inventory<00:03:38.570> all<00:03:38.930> I

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
a prefab it's in the inventory all I

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.050 
a prefab it's in the inventory all I
have<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.560> do<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.890> call<00:03:40.130> one<00:03:40.370> line<00:03:40.579> of<00:03:40.760> code<00:03:41.030> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
have to do is call one line of code and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.390 
have to do is call one line of code and
say<00:03:41.360> attach<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.900> sword<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.410> both<00:03:43.160> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
say attach the sword and both the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.699 
say attach the sword and both the
mountain<00:03:43.700> points<00:03:44.000> connect<00:03:44.420> together<00:03:44.570> so<00:03:45.560> let

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
mountain points connect together so let

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.949 
mountain points connect together so let
me<00:03:45.769> show<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.160> code<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.230> right<00:03:48.230> here<00:03:48.709> is

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
me show you that code so right here is

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.420 
me show you that code so right here is
the<00:03:50.959> line<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:51.620> just<00:03:51.860> called

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the line that we just called

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.940 
the line that we just called
so<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:52.910> basically<00:03:53.329> say<00:03:53.750> here's<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.590> name<00:03:54.769> of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
so we basically say here's the name of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.039 
so we basically say here's the name of
our<00:03:55.070> avatar<00:03:55.610> here's<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.269> mount<00:03:56.480> point<00:03:56.810> on

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
our avatar here's the mount point on

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.920 
our avatar here's the mount point on
that<00:03:57.260> avatar<00:03:57.769> here's<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.910> sword<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.690> is<00:03:59.840> the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
that avatar here's the sword this is the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.599 
that avatar here's the sword this is the
name<00:04:00.110> of<00:04:00.140> this<00:04:00.320> sword<00:04:00.560> object<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.280> here's<00:04:01.489> the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
name of this sword object and here's the

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.250 
name of this sword object and here's the
mount<00:04:01.820> point<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.299> we<00:04:02.690> connect<00:04:03.019> them<00:04:03.139> together

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
mount point and we connect them together

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.470 
mount point and we connect them together
so<00:04:03.650> with<00:04:03.799> that<00:04:03.919> one<00:04:04.130> line<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.489> code<00:04:04.760> we<00:04:05.329> did

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
so with that one line of code we did

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.340 
so with that one line of code we did
exactly<00:04:05.900> what<00:04:05.989> you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
exactly what you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.710 
exactly what you
saw<00:04:06.500> but<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.430> isn't<00:04:07.670> just<00:04:07.850> with<00:04:08.150> static

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
saw but it isn't just with static

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.480 
saw but it isn't just with static
objects<00:04:09.140> either<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:09.860> let's<00:04:09.980> take<00:04:10.250> something

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
objects either so let's take something

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.550 
objects either so let's take something
like<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.760> skin<00:04:11.090> mesh<00:04:11.300> like<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.960> pair<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.260> pants

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
like a skin mesh like a pair of pants

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.210 
like a skin mesh like a pair of pants
what<00:04:13.040> we<00:04:13.190> can<00:04:13.400> do<00:04:13.580> is<00:04:14.140> have<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.440> skinned<00:04:15.950> mesh

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
what we can do is have that skinned mesh

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.610 
what we can do is have that skinned mesh
put<00:04:16.580> specifically<00:04:17.270> on<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:17.750> avatar<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.470> if<00:04:18.530> I

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
put specifically on this avatar so if I

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.680 
put specifically on this avatar so if I
had<00:04:18.739> four<00:04:19.070> characters<00:04:19.610> in<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.790> row<00:04:19.970> that's<00:04:20.450> not

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
had four characters in a row that's not

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.420 
had four characters in a row that's not
a<00:04:20.720> problem<00:04:21.140> they're<00:04:21.350> all<00:04:21.500> animated<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
a problem they're all animated in the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.010 
a problem they're all animated in the
different<00:04:22.820> way<00:04:22.970> or<00:04:23.240> at<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.450> different<00:04:23.780> timing

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
different way or at a different timing

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.440 
different way or at a different timing
let's<00:04:24.380> say<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.830> can<00:04:25.340> just<00:04:25.550> create<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.850> pants<00:04:26.120> on

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
let's say I can just create a pants on

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.150 
let's say I can just create a pants on
each<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.900> them<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.290> same<00:04:27.320> set<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:27.860> pants

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
each of them and the same set of pants

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.460 
each of them and the same set of pants
will<00:04:28.460> follow<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:29.060> bones<00:04:29.390> that<00:04:29.690> are<00:04:29.810> specific

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
will follow the bones that are specific

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.460 
will follow the bones that are specific
to<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.980> avatar<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.670> it's<00:04:31.820> tied<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.690> in

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
to the avatar that it's tied to and in

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.170 
to the avatar that it's tied to and in
that<00:04:33.680> way<00:04:33.890> what<00:04:34.160> we<00:04:34.250> can<00:04:34.430> do<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.850> we<00:04:35.030> can

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
that way what we can do is we can

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.340 
that way what we can do is we can
basically<00:04:35.390> create<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.470> whole<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:38.300> whole<00:04:38.930> set<00:04:39.320> of

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
basically create a whole a whole set of

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.610 
basically create a whole a whole set of
arm<00:04:39.710> or<00:04:39.890> a<00:04:39.920> whole<00:04:40.130> set<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.430> weapons<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:41.620> swap

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
arm or a whole set of weapons and swap

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.230 
arm or a whole set of weapons and swap
them<00:04:42.890> in<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.340> out<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:43.700> all<00:04:43.970> of<00:04:44.000> our

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
them in and out for all of our

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.720 
them in and out for all of our
characters<00:04:44.540> tying<00:04:45.500> in<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.770> skin<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.370> mesh<00:04:46.550> is

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
characters tying in the skin the mesh is

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.540 
characters tying in the skin the mesh is
like<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.090> just<00:04:47.120> saw<00:04:47.510> again<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.260> one<00:04:49.160> line<00:04:49.370> of

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
like you just saw again is one line of

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.880 
like you just saw again is one line of
code<00:04:49.580> which<00:04:50.480> basically<00:04:50.870> says<00:04:51.290> for<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.620> shirt

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
code which basically says for the shirt

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.700 
code which basically says for the shirt
here<00:04:52.280> who's<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.480> object<00:04:54.050> we<00:04:54.170> want<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.530> tie<00:04:54.680> it

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
here who's the object we want to tie it

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.190 
here who's the object we want to tie it
to<00:04:55.040> and<00:04:55.250> then<00:04:55.880> what's<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.480> location<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.110> the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
to and then what's the location of the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.170 
to and then what's the location of the
prefab<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.250> skinned<00:04:58.610> mesh<00:04:58.940> this

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
prefab that is the skinned mesh this

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.380 
prefab that is the skinned mesh this
shirt<00:04:59.540> and<00:04:59.750> we<00:05:00.170> tie<00:05:00.410> them<00:05:00.530> together<00:05:00.740> and

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
shirt and we tie them together and

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.540 
shirt and we tie them together and
that's<00:05:02.390> what<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:02.930> get<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:03.680> mount<00:05:04.190> points<00:05:04.460> has

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
that's what you get so mount points has

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.040 
that's what you get so mount points has
worked<00:05:04.730> out<00:05:04.880> really<00:05:04.910> well<00:05:05.210> for<00:05:05.390> us<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:06.020> know

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
worked out really well for us I know
