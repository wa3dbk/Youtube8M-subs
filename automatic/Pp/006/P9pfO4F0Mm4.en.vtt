few other Apple products for a number of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
few other Apple products for a number of
months<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.760> until<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.360> hasn't<00:00:51.899> been

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
months but until now it hasn't been

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
months but until now it hasn't been
usable<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> part<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.149> didn't<00:00:54.390> have

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
usable in part because you didn't have

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
usable in part because you didn't have
adapters<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.590> part<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
adapters like this in part because this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.569 
adapters like this in part because this
cable<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.180> from<00:00:57.780> Apple<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.379> required<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
cable here from Apple is required to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.430 
cable here from Apple is required to
make<00:00:59.730> use<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.629> runs<00:01:00.750> about<00:01:00.989> 50

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
make use of it and it runs about 50

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
make use of it and it runs about 50
bucks<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> these

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
bucks so we actually have one of these

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
bucks so we actually have one of these

the count of 3 we're going to drop it
and<00:01:40.439> we're<00:01:40.590> gonna<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:41.159> long<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.490> takes<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and we're gonna see how long it takes to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.830 
and we're gonna see how long it takes to
move<00:01:42.509> 2.5<00:01:43.140> gigabytes<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.920> information<00:01:44.840> from

move 2.5 gigabytes of information from

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.039 
move 2.5 gigabytes of information from
my<00:01:46.079> hard<00:01:46.350> drive<00:01:46.530> over<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.750> Seagate<00:01:48.750> go

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
my hard drive over to the Seagate go

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.590 
my hard drive over to the Seagate go
flex<00:01:49.380> drive<00:01:50.149> with<00:01:51.200> USB<00:01:52.200> 2.0<00:01:53.030> 1<00:01:54.030> 2<00:01:54.689> 3<00:01:56.210> ok<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.390> now

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
flex drive with USB 2.0 1 2 3 ok so now

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
flex drive with USB 2.0 1 2 3 ok so now
it's<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.950> watch<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.340> it's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
it's going and we can watch as it's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's going and we can watch as it's
moving<00:01:59.670> along<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> striking<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
moving along it is kind of striking to

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.319 
moving along it is kind of striking to
see<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.619> speed<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.860> lack<00:02:05.070> thereof<00:02:05.549> with<00:02:06.060> which

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
see the speed or lack thereof with which

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.740 
see the speed or lack thereof with which
this<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.930> moving<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:08.429> USB<00:02:08.849> 2.0<00:02:09.360> came<00:02:09.569> out<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
this is moving when USB 2.0 came out I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
this is moving when USB 2.0 came out I
think<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.349> thought<00:02:10.619> wow<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.310> is

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
think we all thought wow this is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.369 
think we all thought wow this is
incredibly<00:02:12.060> fast<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.569> you're<00:02:13.230> actually

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
incredibly fast but you're actually

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.240 
incredibly fast but you're actually
sitting<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.950> waiting

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
sitting and waiting

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.730 
sitting and waiting
for<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> while<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.000> while<00:02:15.210> 2.5<00:02:15.840> gigabytes<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
for a while and while 2.5 gigabytes of

while<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.560> happening<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.820> we're<00:02:39.390> gonna

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
while this is happening and we're gonna

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300

you<00:02:39.690> know<00:02:39.780> we're<00:02:40.020> gonna<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.470> time<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.130> when

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
you know we're gonna time time this when

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.490 
you know we're gonna time time this when
we<00:02:41.430> come<00:02:41.580> back<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.570> edit<00:02:43.020> up<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> video

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
we come back and we edit up the video

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.960 
we come back and we edit up the video
but<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.550> don't<00:02:45.090> need<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> timer<00:02:47.610> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
but you don't need to have a timer to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.270 
but you don't need to have a timer to
show<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:50.130> not

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
show that to see that this is really not

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.910 
show that to see that this is really not
a<00:02:51.830> quick<00:02:52.830> process<00:02:52.860> at<00:02:53.580> all<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:55.350> Thunderbolt

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
a quick process at all the Thunderbolt

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.420 
a quick process at all the Thunderbolt
is<00:02:56.070> said<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.489> 20<00:02:56.880> times<00:02:57.060> faster<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:59.130> it's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
is said to be 20 times faster so it's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.280 
is said to be 20 times faster so it's
pretty<00:03:00.150> impressive<00:03:00.420> we're<00:03:00.810> gonna<00:03:00.930> run<00:03:01.140> down

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
pretty impressive we're gonna run down

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.440 
pretty impressive we're gonna run down

long<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.620> taking<00:03:10.770> because<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.850> make

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
long this is taking because when we make

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.680 
long this is taking because when we make
the<00:03:12.209> swap<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.500> put<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.730> drive<00:03:15.120> connected

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the swap and we put the drive connected

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.340 
the swap and we put the drive connected
to<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.500> Thunderbolt<00:03:17.220> adapter<00:03:17.959> on<00:03:18.959> the

to the Thunderbolt adapter on the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.080 
to the Thunderbolt adapter on the
computer<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.100> move<00:03:20.310> over<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.670> 2.5

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
computer and we move over the 2.5

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.550 
computer and we move over the 2.5
gigabytes<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.810> information<00:03:22.350> you're<00:03:22.500> gonna

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
gigabytes of information you're gonna

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.710 
gigabytes of information you're gonna
see<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.190> difference<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.700> speed<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.540> fact

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
see the difference in speed and in fact

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.900 
see the difference in speed and in fact
we'll<00:03:24.959> try<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.769> them<00:03:25.890> side-by-side<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.790> we

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
we'll try to put them side-by-side if we

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.400 
we'll try to put them side-by-side if we
can<00:03:27.090> with<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.360> video<00:03:27.600> because<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.170> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
can with the video because this it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.199 
can with the video because this it
really<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.860> huge<00:03:29.280> difference<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.880> what<00:03:30.090> you

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
really is a huge difference in what you

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.080 
really is a huge difference in what you
get<00:03:30.420> ok<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:30.989> there<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.320> go<00:03:31.440> that's<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:32.940> move

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
get ok so there we go that's it we move

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.170 
get ok so there we go that's it we move
2.5<00:03:33.690> gigabytes<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.230> data<00:03:34.380> over<00:03:34.850> i've<00:03:35.850> now

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
2.5 gigabytes of data over i've now

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.000 
2.5 gigabytes of data over i've now

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
adapter and once again we're going to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.979 
adapter and once again we're going to
take<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.680> 2012<00:03:43.680> shared<00:03:44.220> folder<00:03:44.880> which<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.120> 2.5

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
take the 2012 shared folder which is 2.5

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.800 
take the 2012 shared folder which is 2.5
gigabytes<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.920> size<00:03:47.090> we're<00:03:48.090> going<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.390> drag<00:03:48.600> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
gigabytes in size we're going to drag it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.020 
gigabytes in size we're going to drag it
over<00:03:48.930> here<00:03:50.390> as<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:52.769> can<00:03:53.070> see<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.579> moving

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
over here as you can see it's moving

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.460 
over here as you can see it's moving
really<00:03:54.870> fast<00:03:55.640> thunderbolt<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:57.230> super<00:03:58.230> fast

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
really fast thunderbolt is super fast

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.500 
really fast thunderbolt is super fast
when<00:03:59.130> we<00:03:59.160> put<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.579> video<00:03:59.670> side<00:04:00.090> by<00:04:00.269> side

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
when we put the video side by side

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.390 
when we put the video side by side
you're<00:04:00.750> gonna<00:04:00.870> see<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.320> difference<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:05.100> looks

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
you're gonna see the difference it looks

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.670 
you're gonna see the difference it looks
like<00:04:05.549> 20<00:04:05.880> times<00:04:06.060> faster<00:04:06.329> is<00:04:06.660> probably<00:04:07.290> pretty

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
like 20 times faster is probably pretty

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.979 
like 20 times faster is probably pretty
fair<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.829> we're<00:04:10.980> almost<00:04:11.100> done<00:04:11.720> again<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:12.840> is

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
fair so we're almost done again this is

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.289 
fair so we're almost done again this is
two<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.470> half<00:04:13.650> gigabytes<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.489> data<00:04:14.940> and

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
two and a half gigabytes of data and

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.719 
two and a half gigabytes of data and
it's<00:04:15.540> just<00:04:15.840> flying<00:04:16.350> from<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> computer<00:04:17.459> to

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
it's just flying from the computer to

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.080 
it's just flying from the computer to
the<00:04:17.760> hard<00:04:18.150> drive<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.160> done<00:04:20.370> let's<00:04:20.850> take

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
the hard drive and it's done let's take

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.180 
the hard drive and it's done let's take
a<00:04:21.120> look<00:04:21.390> at<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> videos<00:04:22.079> when<00:04:22.740> they're<00:04:22.890> put

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
a look at the videos when they're put

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.390 
a look at the videos when they're put
side-by-side<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:25.500> here<00:04:25.770> are<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.010> exact<00:04:26.370> same

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
side-by-side so here are the exact same

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.180 
side-by-side so here are the exact same
tests<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.390> just<00:04:27.630> showed<00:04:27.900> you

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
tests that we just showed you

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.130 
tests that we just showed you
on<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.370> bottom<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.970> USB<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.630> connection

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
on the bottom is the USB to connection

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.840 
on the bottom is the USB to connection
on<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.380> top<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.100> thunderbolt<00:04:31.700> connection

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
on the top is the thunderbolt connection

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.510 
on the top is the thunderbolt connection
the<00:04:32.630> exact<00:04:32.960> same<00:04:33.200> data<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.710> exact<00:04:34.010> same<00:04:34.220> drive

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
the exact same data the exact same drive

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.370 
the exact same data the exact same drive
and<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:34.850> can<00:04:34.880> see<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.390> difference<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:35.840> speed

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
and you can see the difference in speed

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.410 
and you can see the difference in speed
I<00:04:36.410> mean<00:04:36.860> we're<00:04:37.160> halfway<00:04:37.490> done<00:04:37.700> with<00:04:37.940> the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
I mean we're halfway done with the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.600 
I mean we're halfway done with the
thunderbolt<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.080> we're<00:04:39.320> not<00:04:39.470> even<00:04:39.710> up<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.980> 500

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
thunderbolt and we're not even up to 500

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.600 
thunderbolt and we're not even up to 500
megabytes<00:04:41.360> done<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.440> USB<00:04:42.680> -<00:04:43.010> you're<00:04:43.520> gonna

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
megabytes done on the USB - you're gonna

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.490 
megabytes done on the USB - you're gonna
see<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.180> by<00:04:44.390> the<00:04:44.420> time<00:04:44.750> we're<00:04:44.960> done<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.200> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
see that by the time we're done with the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.310 
see that by the time we're done with the
thunderbolt<00:04:46.070> connection<00:04:46.570> we're<00:04:47.570> still<00:04:48.140> not

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
thunderbolt connection we're still not

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.140 
thunderbolt connection we're still not
up<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.560> gigabyte<00:04:49.070> on<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.280> USB<00:04:49.490> -<00:04:49.730> connection

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
up to a gigabyte on the USB - connection

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.450 
up to a gigabyte on the USB - connection
same<00:04:50.630> data<00:04:50.900> same<00:04:51.470> Drive<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.280> speed

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
same data same Drive the speed

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.760 
same data same Drive the speed
difference<00:04:52.910> is<00:04:53.120> phenomenal<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.230> when<00:04:54.650> you're

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
difference is phenomenal and when you're

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.290 
difference is phenomenal and when you're
sitting<00:04:54.950> in<00:04:55.130> front<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.490> computer<00:04:55.670> waiting

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
sitting in front of the computer waiting

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.180 
sitting in front of the computer waiting
for<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.540> data<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.960> move<00:04:57.080> over<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.830> difference

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
for the data to move over the difference

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.690 
for the data to move over the difference
is<00:04:58.370> even<00:04:58.640> more<00:04:58.850> noticeable<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.860> that's<00:05:01.400> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
is even more noticeable so that's the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.400 
is even more noticeable so that's the
difference<00:05:01.850> with<00:05:02.180> thunderbolt<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:03.020> have<00:05:03.230> to

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
difference with thunderbolt you have to

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.410 
difference with thunderbolt you have to
get<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.620> Thunderbolt<00:05:04.160> cable<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.730> addition<00:05:05.210> and

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
get a Thunderbolt cable in addition and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.760 
get a Thunderbolt cable in addition and
you<00:05:05.660> need<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.960> bring<00:05:06.110> your<00:05:06.260> own<00:05:06.410> hard<00:05:06.710> drive

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
you need to bring your own hard drive

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.310 
you need to bring your own hard drive
but<00:05:07.670> if<00:05:07.790> you<00:05:07.940> need<00:05:08.180> speed<00:05:08.600> if<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:08.990> want<00:05:09.200> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
but if you need speed if you want the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.100 
but if you need speed if you want the
flexibility<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.820> is<00:05:11.060> an<00:05:11.210> amazing<00:05:11.690> way<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:11.870> go

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
flexibility this is an amazing way to go

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.110 
flexibility this is an amazing way to go
