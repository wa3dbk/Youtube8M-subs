 What did I say or not alive 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:31.050
 I 'm sorry I didn't get in touch or get caught in the university , and I just dropped out and died 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:32.689

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.220

 In addition to Ne with organizing feelings 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.650
 Tea 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.650
 I'm worried I'm eating it with you 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.390
 I don't like it 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.340
 Akihiko 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.780
 friendly 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 So I won't get stuck 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.980
 hiroki 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.980
 Call my name with that voice 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.780
 It worked well-I finished gently 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.830
 Sorry 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.070
 hiro will get me 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070
 This 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.100
 Idiot that I I I was also absolute misunderstanding now 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.530
 With April 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.540
 I asked hiro to tutor 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.480
 It is the ward that fell in love at first sight to hiro 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.590
 Pitch in now 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.760
 I wanted time, but I stopped 2 bytes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.550
 Of course I want to study 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.580
 But the real thing is 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.810
 It's because I lost a lot to hiro even a minute 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.700
 When I first met, hiro was crying 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.590
 Cause it's Mr. Usami 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.270
 I do not ask you what happened now 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.780
 But I will never let you do that 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.359
 I fell in love with Hiro 's crying face 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.359
 But in Hiro's I want you to laugh 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 I am 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.030
 Are you accustomed to, instead of Usami's Oh 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.220
 Go back 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.580
