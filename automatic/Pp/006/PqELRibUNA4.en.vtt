stick a knife or something in there and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.700 
stick a knife or something in there and
wait<00:02:10.850> for<00:02:11.030> your<00:02:11.120> board<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.450> get<00:02:11.540> scratched

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
wait for your board to get scratched

wait for your board to get scratched
yeah<00:02:13.040> it's<00:02:13.250> definitely<00:02:13.490> great<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.690> don't<00:02:15.080> think

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
yeah it's definitely great I don't think

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.100 
yeah it's definitely great I don't think
the<00:02:16.400> size<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> board<00:02:17.360> would<00:02:17.540> vary<00:02:17.810> too

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
the size of the board would vary too

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.050 
the size of the board would vary too
much<00:02:18.350> unless<00:02:18.710> your<00:02:18.920> board<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.460> 45

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
much unless your board is like 45

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.050 
much unless your board is like 45
centimeters<00:02:20.780> wide<00:02:21.020> or<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.250> hundred<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
centimeters wide or like a hundred and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.420 
centimeters wide or like a hundred and
fifteen<00:02:24.050> centimeters<00:02:24.680> long<00:02:24.920> or<00:02:25.160> some<00:02:25.340> like

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
fifteen centimeters long or some like

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.520 
fifteen centimeters long or some like
that<00:02:25.640> other<00:02:26.420> than<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.840> think<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.350> good

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
that other than that I think is good

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.970 
fast i shall the shipping on there was
like<00:03:56.600> nine<00:03:56.810> dollars<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.350> forty-five<00:03:57.650> cents

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
like nine dollars and forty-five cents

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.450 
like nine dollars and forty-five cents
which<00:03:58.850> in<00:03:59.000> my<00:03:59.150> opinion<00:03:59.270> is<00:03:59.780> like<00:04:00.650> it's<00:04:00.890> really

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
which in my opinion is like it's really

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.150 
which in my opinion is like it's really
expensive<00:04:01.670> shipping<00:04:02.180> but<00:04:02.960> he<00:04:03.800> sent<00:04:04.460> it<00:04:05.140> for

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
expensive shipping but he sent it for

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.800 
expensive shipping but he sent it for
basically<00:04:07.160> ten<00:04:07.820> dollars<00:04:08.150> shipping<00:04:08.330> or<00:04:08.660> nine

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
basically ten dollars shipping or nine

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.990 
basically ten dollars shipping or nine
dollars<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.260> fifty<00:04:09.530> Cent<00:04:09.740> shipping<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:10.820> that

dollars and fifty Cent shipping so that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.370
