00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
best ones they use now these are not

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.210

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.319 
think I'll go over some of the stuff I
use<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.339> that<00:00:37.460> most<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.820> my<00:00:37.850> stuff<00:00:38.089> let<00:00:38.269> you

know the coloring in I use a mixer of
true<00:00:40.820> markers<00:00:41.239> these<00:00:41.659> ones<00:00:41.900> which<00:00:42.050> are<00:00:42.170> really

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
true markers these ones which are really

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.710 
true markers these ones which are really
cool<00:00:42.559> they're<00:00:42.739> bit<00:00:42.920> expensive<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:44.480> but

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
cool they're bit expensive and that but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.819 
cool they're bit expensive and that but
they're<00:00:44.839> really<00:00:45.019> called<00:00:45.140> scare<00:00:45.440> come<00:00:45.650> we<00:00:45.739> have

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
they're really called scare come we have

like<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:45.980> brush<00:00:46.309> tip<00:00:46.550> on<00:00:46.879> one<00:00:47.059> side<00:00:48.790> block<00:00:49.790> tip

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
like a brush tip on one side block tip

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.450 
like a brush tip on one side block tip
on<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.900> other<00:00:51.049> side<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:52.159> still<00:00:52.339> got<00:00:52.430> a

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
on the other side and it still got a

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.910 
on the other side and it still got a
little<00:00:52.549> cap<00:00:52.760> at<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:52.909> end<00:00:53.059> get<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.600> fine<00:00:53.809> tip<00:00:54.080> and

little cap at the end get a fine tip and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.619 
little cap at the end get a fine tip and
now<00:00:55.309> now<00:00:55.519> to<00:00:55.580> find<00:00:55.909> stuff<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.119> don't<00:00:56.180> really<00:00:56.449> use

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
now now to find stuff I don't really use

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.329 
now now to find stuff I don't really use
in<00:00:56.809> Spanish<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.199> barely<00:00:57.409> really<00:00:57.979> use<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.159> block

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
in Spanish I barely really use the block

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.270 
in Spanish I barely really use the block
hose<00:00:58.549> used<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:59.119> tend<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.839> use<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.920> brush<00:01:01.129> all

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
hose used I tend to use the brush all

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.820 
hose used I tend to use the brush all
the<00:01:01.309> time<00:01:01.960> now<00:01:02.960> they're<00:01:03.199> expensive

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
the time now they're expensive

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.890 
the time now they're expensive
but<00:01:04.489> once<00:01:04.640> you've<00:01:04.790> bought<00:01:05.000> them<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.449> can<00:01:05.689> buy

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
but once you've bought them you can buy

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.280 
but once you've bought them you can buy
refills<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.090> that<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.780> refills<00:01:09.170> are

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
refills and that so in the refills are

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.460 
refills and that so in the refills are
quite<00:01:09.470> cheap<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.400> over<00:01:10.670> time<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:11.240> know<00:01:12.170> these

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
quite cheap so over time you know these

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.410 
quite cheap so over time you know these
ones<00:01:12.680> are<00:01:12.770> very<00:01:12.799> good<00:01:13.100> value<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.549> that<00:01:14.299> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
ones are very good value and that the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.179 
ones are very good value and that the
Flex<00:01:14.630> markers<00:01:15.049> they're<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> bit<00:01:15.710> cheaper<00:01:16.070> to

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
Flex markers they're a bit cheaper to

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.840 
Flex markers they're a bit cheaper to
buy<00:01:16.340> initially<00:01:17.229> as<00:01:18.229> these<00:01:18.470> ones<00:01:18.680> now<00:01:19.610> these

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
buy initially as these ones now these

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.040 
buy initially as these ones now these
ones<00:01:20.030> are<00:01:20.210> really<00:01:20.420> liking<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.840> they're

ones are really liking that they're
pretty<00:01:21.170> much<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.470> same<00:01:21.650> they<00:01:22.340> got<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.810> block

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
pretty much the same they got a block

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.260 
pretty much the same they got a block
mark<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.170> one<00:01:24.290> side<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.880> brush<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270

mark on one side and a brush to the
other<00:01:26.420> side<00:01:26.630> now<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.320> brush<00:01:27.620> tip<00:01:27.830> for<00:01:28.040> me<00:01:28.220> on

other side now the brush tip for me on

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.800 
other side now the brush tip for me on
the<00:01:28.610> Flex<00:01:28.820> mark<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:29.120> a<00:01:29.150> bit<00:01:29.300> more<00:01:29.480> kind<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:29.750> like

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the Flex mark is a bit more kind of like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.410 
the Flex mark is a bit more kind of like
a<00:01:29.900> brush<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.159> that's<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:31.520> tend<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.940> find<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.330> but

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
a brush and that's I tend to find it but

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.480 
a brush and that's I tend to find it but
easier<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.810> blend<00:01:32.990> these<00:01:33.140> ones<00:01:33.350> l<00:01:33.560> now

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
easier to blend these ones l now

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.010 
easier to blend these ones l now
initially<00:01:34.820> do<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.180> bit<00:01:35.300> cheaper<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.750> buy<00:01:35.960> it

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
initially do a bit cheaper to buy it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.040 
initially do a bit cheaper to buy it
then<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.830> tria<00:01:37.040> markers<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.810> can't

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
then the tria markers but you can't

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.390 
then the tria markers but you can't
refill<00:01:39.470> these<00:01:39.650> ones<00:01:41.590> your<00:01:42.590> pro<00:01:42.800> markers<00:01:43.190> and

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
refill these ones your pro markers and

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.130 
refill these ones your pro markers and
that<00:01:44.060> need<00:01:44.210> another<00:01:44.360> quite<00:01:44.630> sort<00:01:44.870> of<00:01:44.930> stand

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140

you get these ones anywhere and and
they're<00:01:47.990> fairly<00:01:48.170> cheap<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:49.340> they<00:01:49.610> come

as<00:03:35.540> with<00:03:36.350> using<00:03:36.620> H<00:03:36.889> over<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.190> top<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.519> can<00:03:37.549> get

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
as with using H over the top you can get

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.319 
as with using H over the top you can get
really<00:03:37.970> Bend<00:03:38.150> out<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.420> really<00:03:38.569> smooth<00:03:39.190> so

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
really Bend out and really smooth so

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.879 
really Bend out and really smooth so
that's<00:03:41.329> what<00:03:41.480> type<00:03:41.780> doesn't<00:03:42.079> Mel<00:03:42.230> only<00:03:42.799> the

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
that's what type doesn't Mel only the

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.710 
that's what type doesn't Mel only the
pencil<00:03:43.160> grade<00:03:43.389> so<00:03:44.769> remember<00:03:45.769> that<00:03:46.329> war<00:03:47.329> paints

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
pencil grade so remember that war paints

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.660 
pencil grade so remember that war paints
and<00:03:47.930> again<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.889> know<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.040> me<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> water<00:03:49.459> paint

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
and again you know to me the water paint

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.470 
and again you know to me the water paint
make<00:03:49.819> doesn't<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.269> make<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.420> difference

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
make doesn't really make a difference

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.690 
make doesn't really make a difference
you<00:03:50.959> know<00:03:51.079> these<00:03:51.230> are<00:03:51.350> ones<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.560> use<00:03:51.709> mostly<00:03:52.130> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
you know these are ones I use mostly and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.190 
you know these are ones I use mostly and
if<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.850> can<00:03:52.970> see<00:03:53.060> fungus<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.720> close<00:03:53.930> enough

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
if you can see fungus and close enough

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.759 
if you can see fungus and close enough

you know if you don't want to get big

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.559 
you know if you don't want to get big
range<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.340> colors<00:04:07.579> make<00:04:07.790> sure<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.000> get<00:04:08.180> blue

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
range of colors make sure you get blue

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.979 
range of colors make sure you get blue
yellow<00:04:09.200> red<00:04:10.030> black<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.090> white<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.720> know<00:04:11.840> with

yellow red black and white you know with
them<00:04:12.139> you<00:04:12.290> can<00:04:12.380> pretty<00:04:12.500> much<00:04:12.590> make<00:04:12.709> any<00:04:13.160> color

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
them you can pretty much make any color

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.610 
them you can pretty much make any color
by<00:04:13.579> mixing<00:04:13.730> but<00:04:14.720> for<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:14.959> lot<00:04:15.079> of<00:04:15.109> people<00:04:15.349> stein

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
mixing them can take a while so try get

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.190 
mixing them can take a while so try get
yourself<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.639> decent<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:20.539> know<00:04:20.660> sort<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:20.959> say

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
yourself a decent you know sort of say

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.920 
yourself a decent you know sort of say
to<00:04:21.229> have<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.470> big<00:04:21.620> variety<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.979> them<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.930> that

to have a big variety of them and that

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.330 
to have a big variety of them and that
fusing<00:04:24.260> all<00:04:24.380> colors<00:04:24.680> which<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.919> use<00:04:25.070> every<00:04:25.250> now

rather than paper and that on paper it

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.630 
rather than paper and that on paper it
kind<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.710> gets<00:04:58.860> absorbed<00:04:59.010> really<00:04:59.370> into<00:04:59.550> it

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
kind of gets absorbed really into it

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.100 
kind of gets absorbed really into it
really<00:04:59.760> quickly<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.210> sometimes<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.870> can<00:05:00.930> be<00:05:00.990> a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
really quickly and sometimes it can be a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.630 
really quickly and sometimes it can be a
bit<00:05:01.260> tough<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.650> work<00:05:01.800> with<00:05:02.040> after<00:05:02.250> swear<00:05:02.550> on

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
bit tough to work with after swear on
