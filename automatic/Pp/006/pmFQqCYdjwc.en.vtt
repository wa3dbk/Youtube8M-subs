00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290
 the neighbourhood 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 that would be the problem 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.420
 why actually 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.850
 make the declaration open 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.140

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.430
 if you have one 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.040
 j 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.870

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.910
 year no more 9 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 Stanley and Wells Fargo are involved 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 but 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.470
 I it ipp 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 the viaduct 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.869
 with a number of others 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.149
 it is too late, too, that is small 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.349
 that is ago yes and no I am not a moment and household items 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.159
 more than a century later 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.529
 good luck 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.119
 earlier 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.969
 if need one 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.969
 it saves 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 all 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.139
 the 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 that is a decrease to 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:55.580
 6 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.019
 a lot better 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.019
 disagree 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.569
 such an investigation 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.569
 after a small one 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.449
 it's that anyway 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.179
 9 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 we have 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.849
 one of the main suspects is to see their debts 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:33.550
 be present in the studio with a new life in the teenager 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.839
 partly because of this there is nothing more to do with it 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.259
 the goals 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:42.969

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.070
 but in itself when you enter dining room 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.689
 the could 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.689
 and to things they do 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:02.900
 the fire started in an interview in the summer, followed later by a french 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.069
