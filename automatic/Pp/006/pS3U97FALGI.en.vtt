see that the kids wanted to use them and
we<00:01:49.899> had<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.200> find<00:01:50.950> ways<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.459> setting

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
we had to find ways of setting

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.020 
we had to find ways of setting
boundaries<00:01:52.599> and<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.920> make<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.640> fair<00:01:55.000> that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
boundaries and to make it fair that

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.240 
boundaries and to make it fair that
everyone<00:01:55.420> would<00:01:55.660> get<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.959> go<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.380> we<00:01:56.500> put<00:01:57.130> all

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
everyone would get to go so we put all

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.669 
everyone would get to go so we put all
those<00:01:57.369> things<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.789> place<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.390> then<00:01:59.170> then<00:01:59.530> the

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
those things in place and then then the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.680 
those things in place and then then the
challenge<00:02:00.009> was<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.399> find<00:02:00.580> what<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:01.420> were<00:02:01.509> dense

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
challenge was to find what we were dense

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.300 
challenge was to find what we were dense
but<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> iPads<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.709> how<00:02:02.830> we<00:02:02.890> were<00:02:03.160> going

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
but on the iPads and how we were going

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.940 
but on the iPads and how we were going
to<00:02:03.429> use<00:02:03.610> them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to use them

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.100 
to use them
we've<00:02:05.950> put<00:02:06.310> together<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:07.030> suite<00:02:07.539> of<00:02:07.690> apps<00:02:07.899> that

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
we've put together a suite of apps that

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.979 
we've put together a suite of apps that
we've<00:02:08.380> researched<00:02:09.099> ourselves<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:09.989> then

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
we've researched ourselves and then

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.449 
we've researched ourselves and then
there's<00:02:11.200> other<00:02:11.349> topic<00:02:11.800> based<00:02:11.890> things<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.370> we

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
there's other topic based things that we

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.040 
there's other topic based things that we
can<00:02:12.610> add<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.610> Creator<00:02:15.970> where<00:02:16.840> they

example<00:04:43.450> looking<00:04:43.690> at<00:04:43.810> workflow<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.890> how<00:04:45.130> you

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
example looking at workflow and how you

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.250 
example looking at workflow and how you
can<00:04:45.640> develop<00:04:45.820> content<00:04:46.540> in<00:04:46.720> one<00:04:46.930> app<00:04:47.110> and

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
can create that content that they can

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.710 
can create that content that they can
create<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:26.520> way<00:05:26.670> they<00:05:26.910> can<00:05:27.120> present<00:05:27.330> what

something<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.850> be<00:05:32.880> truly<00:05:33.240> proud<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.440> I

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
something to be truly proud of and I

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.150 
something to be truly proud of and I
think<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:34.860> that's<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.940> brilliant
