 we will have we have received the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.219
 red example above we have the various 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.899
 data on the package because it warns us 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.550
 rejoiced that the processor is a qualcomm 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.460
 snapdragon dolby technology for the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.299
 headphones wireless charging technology more 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.590
 I live and the various information and the various 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.890
 things we will find in the package 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.200
 we will have already written here now we go to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 open the package I had closed 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 on the contrary I think where we find 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.820
 immediately the new cia terminal provided us 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.280
 have provided new nokia that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.140
 thank you 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.610
 in the package we have the brooch for 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.259
 open to insert and remove the sim 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 below we have various compartments vi 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.970
 I confess that the first time I open 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.110
 me too 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.360
 the package 2 we find the manuals 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.180
 it's not much and only this one can you 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.689
 see we put back said to do a 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.840
 bit of order we have usb charger 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.880
 to charge usual usb wall 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.630
 definitely nokia micro usb cable 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.329
 and the headphones in ear with the various grommets e 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 indien tac with the example phone if 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.030
 we will talk white phone white for 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.550
 ecology we would not already have in this 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.959
 case we see red 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.730
 let's put a little bit in place 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.900
 a little bit the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:21.269
 pack here and take the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:25.530
 phone terminate that we remove the 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.390
 plastics around the phone in mind 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.440
 let's say the various features why 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.620
 we have a thickness of only 8.7 mm with 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.330
 really very very very very much 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.040
 thin in the meantime we are trying to 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.650
 understand how to open it without destroying 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.519
 the whole package we all have a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:54.840
 height of 160 2.8 mm is one often one 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:57.989
 width of 80 54 mm we therefore have a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.180
 weight of 200 9 grams which held 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.440
 little in hand as I am holding it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.410
 I don't seem particularly right now 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.430
 however heavy is certain that is not that it is not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 feel the heaviness but above all 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.819
 what is striking I know the size 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.560
 really really big 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.480
 windows phone 8 lumia black edition 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.200
 as read on the box then we talk 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.099
 of processor qualcomm snapdragon 800 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:33.090
 with a 2 GB RAM and a card 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.910
 adreno 330 continuous engine graphics 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.049
 the phone while we can while 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.410
 let's say the features we can 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.099
 note that the back is extremely 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.530
 polished then even a little bit 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.349
 slippery not like him at 625 he has 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.620
 could have tried a little bit though 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.620
 slippery it is good the nokia texture is 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.180
 the written more rue you see almost a 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.680
 hardly where in the back we can already 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.209
 note what you said more view why 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.400
 the camera really points a sensor 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.319
 very large and we have double led flash 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.180
 because the camera and 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:18.299
 from 20 20 megapixel that records 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:21.789
 video obviously maximum resolution 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.240
 1080 x 1920 pixels the front camera 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.669
 located here that ops has left from 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.699
 front camera frame located 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.840
 high left and 1.2 megapixel line 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.789
 we have a display with you want to see 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.580
 which is perhaps most striking about this 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:44.949
 terminal 6 inches 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:51.820
 if inch full hd is an ips lcd 1080 x 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:53.259
 1920 really truly beautiful pixels from 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.720
 hold the back we already have 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:01.419
 could see that it is not removable 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:06.490
 you can extract the back and the up 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.889
 Integrated memory is 32 32 gigabytes 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.139
 we have here on the left side the 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:16.030
 possibility to extract see 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:22.630
 trolley to insert the SIM if not 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:25.750
 erro yes go we close a little bit here 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.530
 below we have if it wasn't the button panel 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.960
 a keypad below the loudspeaker is 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.729
 this one you see is not really right 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.300
 flush is slightly protruding and therefore 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.650
 should not should not at all a 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.690
 all yes completely balance the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.099
 volume on the right side blogos button 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.229
 logo that located in very position 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.669
 intelligent because the state pinato 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.990
 it would have been a problem while not here 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.090
 it's a particular problem you only have 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.259
 we have double stroke buttons of the 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.039
 camera with the possibility of 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:57.570
 load the terminal below with the 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:03.449
 the micro usb memory port precisely 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:07.560
 expandable to 4 gigabytes and since 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:10.780
 finally the network is network supported up to 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.389
 4g for a terminal with a battery from 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.610
 3,400 milian because it really promises 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.940
 very very well features are 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.120
 certainly from the top of the range 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.910
 however the expansion of memory then 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.050
 we have it here for a real term 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.030
 very interesting the problem in 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.870
 coming days and before leaving us a 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:35.590
 brief dimensional comparison with a 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.090
 tablet 7 inch hd slay 7 plus 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.990
 despite having a cover that doesn't 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.750
 likes slightly with a nexus 5 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:49.680
 you can well see that the differences 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:52.840
 dimensional are really really 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.700
 notable a greeting to all from sergio for 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.700
