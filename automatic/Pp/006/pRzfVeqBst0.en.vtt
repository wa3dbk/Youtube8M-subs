00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.429 

that's<00:00:00.299> before<00:00:00.690> we<00:00:00.840> started<00:00:01.140> our<00:00:01.290> first

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
that's before we started our first

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.619 
that's before we started our first
meeting<00:00:02.070> from<00:00:02.310> day<00:00:02.520> one<00:00:02.790> so<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.360> are<00:00:03.419> lucky

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
meeting from day one so we are lucky

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.349 
meeting from day one so we are lucky
because<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:04.670> this<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.790> think<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.240> most

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
because I this I think is the most

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.059 
because I this I think is the most
impressive<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.230> basically<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
impressive so this is basically a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.150 
impressive so this is basically a
development<00:00:09.059> platform<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.110> use<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:11.010> be

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
development platform that we use the be

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
development platform that we use the be
using<00:00:11.400> talent<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.940> bag<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.480> some<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.870> this

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
using talent to the bag and some so this

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.200 
using talent to the bag and some so this
is<00:00:13.139> really<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> first<00:00:13.440> silicon<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:15.089> have

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
is really the first silicon we we have

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.189 
is really the first silicon we we have
we<00:00:15.719> get<00:00:16.379> back<00:00:16.680> from<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> fam<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
we get back from from the fam so the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
we get back from from the fam so the
idea<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.470> really<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.010> running<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.510> on<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
idea is really this is running on a on a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.650 
idea is really this is running on a on a
full<00:00:22.320> HD<00:00:22.680> display<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> wanted<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> give<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
full HD display so I wanted to give you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.460 
full HD display so I wanted to give you
a<00:00:25.050> glimpse<00:00:25.789> haha<00:00:26.900> just<00:00:27.900> letting<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> city

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
a glimpse haha just letting the city

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.890 
a glimpse haha just letting the city
come<00:00:28.590> back<00:00:29.060> working<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.090> few<00:00:30.330> drivers<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
come back working with few drivers and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.569 
come back working with few drivers and
so<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.320> make<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.250> stable

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
so on and make it and make it a stable

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.479 
so on and make it and make it a stable
platform<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.180> course<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> nowhere<00:00:34.489> near

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
platform of course this is nowhere near

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
platform of course this is nowhere near
when<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.329> find<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.469> put

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
when you find out because you put

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.100 
when you find out because you put
there's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> ton<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> work<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.600> need<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.989> an

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
there's a ton of work we need to do an

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.510 
there's a ton of work we need to do an
optimizer<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> let<00:00:43.050> me<00:00:43.110> show<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.649> what

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
optimizer so let me show you what what

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.660 
optimizer so let me show you what what
we<00:00:44.640> did<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.300> case<00:00:46.230> works<00:00:46.530> also<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.039> tie

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
we did with the case works also this tie

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
we did with the case works also this tie
rod<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.230> using<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.829> special<00:00:56.160> version

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
rod so this is using a special version

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.849 
rod so this is using a special version
OpenGL<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.539> OpenGL<00:00:57.870> ES<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
OpenGL of this is OpenGL ES for the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
OpenGL of this is OpenGL ES for the
three<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.550> Igor<00:01:00.859> okay<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
three right Igor okay so now if I put a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.030 
three right Igor okay so now if I put a
pc<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.119> put<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> next<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
pc here and put it next to you and you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
pc here and put it next to you and you
stay<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.180> meter<00:01:09.360> away<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.900> think<00:01:10.170> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
stay like one meter away I think you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
stay like one meter away I think you
will<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.619> notice<00:01:10.920> any<00:01:11.280> difference<00:01:11.729> between

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
will not notice any difference between

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.910 
will not notice any difference between
running<00:01:12.990> ola<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> g-force<00:01:14.340> platformer<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
running ola on a g-force platformer and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.560 
running ola on a g-force platformer and
running<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> mobile<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
running on a mobile so you see this this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.859 
running on a mobile so you see this this
example<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:20.000> see<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.330> make<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.630> once

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
example here see if I can make it once

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.770 
example here see if I can make it once
again<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> light<00:01:24.570> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
again you see you see the light is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
again you see you see the light is
coming<00:01:25.020> through<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.710> basically<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.670> sort

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
coming through and basically is a sort

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
coming through and basically is a sort
of<00:01:27.390> filtering<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.259> reddish<00:01:28.650> color<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
of filtering the reddish color of the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.270 
of filtering the reddish color of the
veins<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.020> called

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
veins and so on and so that's called

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.880 
veins and so on and so that's called
subsurface<00:01:32.280> scattering<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.890> it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
subsurface scattering right but it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.940 
subsurface scattering right but it's
impressive<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> realism

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
impressive to see you know the realism

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.520 
impressive to see you know the realism
of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> eyes<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
of the eyes now you know if you're in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.990 
of the eyes now you know if you're in
front<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> character<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.729> staring

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
front of the character is really staring

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
front of the character is really staring
at<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> weight

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
at you you see you see that the weight

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.380 
at you you see you see that the weight
of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> eyes<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> reflection<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
of the eyes you see the reflection and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.470 
of the eyes you see the reflection and
you<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> skin<00:01:49.579> incredibly<00:01:50.579> detailed

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
you see the skin incredibly detailed

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.850 
you see the skin incredibly detailed
right<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> there's<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.110> lot<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> desolation

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
right and there's a lot of desolation

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340 
right and there's a lot of desolation
going<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.600> movement<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.050> pretty

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
going on in there the movement is pretty

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.610 
going on in there the movement is pretty
accurate<00:01:59.330> so<00:02:00.330> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.690> something<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> again

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
accurate so this is something that again

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.590 
accurate so this is something that again
you<00:02:01.800> know<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> always<00:02:02.850> try<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.480> in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
you know I always try to put in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.390 
you know I always try to put in
perspective<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.620> it's<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.210> 250<00:02:06.380> watts

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
perspective for you it's like 250 watts

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.450 
perspective for you it's like 250 watts
versus<00:02:08.400> two<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.820> three<00:02:09.560> running<00:02:10.560> almost<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
versus two to three running almost the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.210 
versus two to three running almost the
same<00:02:11.640> quality<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:13.530> again<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.130> know

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
same quality but again this you know

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.890 
same quality but again this you know
when<00:02:14.370> when<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.850> show<00:02:15.240> something<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:15.780> this

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
when when you show something like this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.930 
when when you show something like this
to<00:02:16.140> developers<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:17.490> they<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.780> foresee<00:02:19.350> wow

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
to developers they they can foresee wow

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.420 
to developers they they can foresee wow
this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.390> second<00:02:21.720> target<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.250> can

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
this is on a second target and I can

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.570 
this is on a second target and I can
create<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:23.970> compelling<00:02:24.600> content<00:02:25.580> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
create you know compelling content that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:40.200 
create you know compelling content that
can<00:02:26.820> differentiate<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.750> others

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.440 

okay<00:02:41.050> let<00:02:41.350> me<00:02:41.470> show<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:43.230> second<00:02:44.230> demo<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.300> we

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
okay let me show you a second demo so we

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.020 
okay let me show you a second demo so we
did<00:02:46.600> another<00:02:46.750> demo<00:02:47.730> island<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.850> is

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
did another demo island this is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.480 
did another demo island this is
specifically<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.720> show<00:02:49.960> you<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.490> desolation

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
specifically to show you the desolation

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.930 
specifically to show you the desolation
words<00:02:51.730> tomorrow<00:02:52.090> k<00:02:53.460> terms<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.580> quality<00:02:54.760> you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
words tomorrow k terms of quality you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.490 
words tomorrow k terms of quality you
see<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.150> reflection<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.960> water<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
see the reflection the water the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.000 
see the reflection the water the
transparency<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.370> pretty<00:02:57.790> impressive<00:02:58.090> for

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
transparency is pretty impressive for

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.220 
transparency is pretty impressive for
for<00:03:00.010> mobile<00:03:00.280> device<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:00.820> as<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.180> know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
for mobile device so as you know

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.390 
for mobile device so as you know
everything<00:03:02.230> we've<00:03:02.350> seen<00:03:02.530> here<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:02.980> made<00:03:03.160> up<00:03:03.280> of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
everything we've seen here is made up of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.810 
everything we've seen here is made up of
triangles<00:03:04.000> lots<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.990> triangles<00:03:05.550> right<00:03:06.550> but<00:03:08.820> if

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
triangles lots of triangles right but if

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.680 
triangles lots of triangles right but if
I<00:03:10.920> remember<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:11.950> remember<00:03:12.490> if<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.240> sure<00:03:13.450> enough

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
I remember to remember if I sure enough

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.510 
I remember to remember if I sure enough
of<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.080> number<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.440> triangles<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.980> my

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
of this is number of triangles of my

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.640 
of this is number of triangles of my
friend<00:03:15.820> mode<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.210> can<00:03:16.450> see<00:03:16.600> all<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.750> all

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
friend mode so you can see all the all

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.830 
friend mode so you can see all the all
the<00:03:17.710> triangles<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.330> technique<00:03:19.690> has<00:03:19.720> been

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
the triangles so this technique has been

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.750 
the triangles so this technique has been
existing<00:03:20.260> on<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.680> pc<00:03:20.860> space<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.400> quite<00:03:21.580> some

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
existing on the pc space for quite some

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.860 
existing on the pc space for quite some
time<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.360> is<00:03:22.510> something<00:03:22.660> that

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
time and this is something that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.840 
time and this is something that
developers<00:03:23.560> really<00:03:23.800> master<00:03:24.310> now<00:03:24.520> because

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
developers really master now because

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.240 
developers really master now because
it's<00:03:25.060> really<00:03:25.360> an<00:03:25.540> effective<00:03:26.470> technique<00:03:26.650> to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's really an effective technique to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.040 
it's really an effective technique to
not<00:03:27.460> only<00:03:28.110> make<00:03:29.110> objects<00:03:29.860> much<00:03:30.630> rounder<00:03:31.630> for

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
not only make objects much rounder for

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.840 
not only make objects much rounder for
example<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.830> know<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.010> always<00:03:33.220> end<00:03:33.520> up<00:03:33.640> if

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
example you know you always end up if

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.400 
example you know you always end up if
you<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.150> Formula<00:03:34.420> One<00:03:34.570> or<00:03:34.960> other<00:03:35.110> games

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
you like a Formula One or other games

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.620 
you like a Formula One or other games
and<00:03:35.710> always<00:03:35.890> look<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.190> little<00:03:36.430> squarish<00:03:37.210> right

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
and always look a little squarish right

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.470 
and always look a little squarish right
so<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.350> more<00:03:38.530> polygons<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.220> add<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.240> better

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
so the more polygons you add the better

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.720 
so the more polygons you add the better
shape<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.680> Danish<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.310> whether<00:03:42.520> there

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
shape to the Danish can be whether there

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.040 
shape to the Danish can be whether there
is<00:03:42.760> little<00:03:43.210> ahead<00:03:43.270> or<00:03:44.200> an<00:03:44.710> object<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.540> let<00:03:47.020> me

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
is little ahead or an object so let me

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.680 
is little ahead or an object so let me
run<00:03:47.260> true<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.710> see<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.010> amount<00:03:48.160> of

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
run true so you see the amount of

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.030 
run true so you see the amount of
polygons<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:51.280> end<00:03:51.490> in<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.700> logo<00:03:53.040> yeah

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
polygons that this end in the logo yeah

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.810 
polygons that this end in the logo yeah
so<00:03:54.970> when<00:03:55.390> we<00:03:55.510> come<00:03:55.690> back<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.830> I<00:03:57.130> now<00:03:57.310> for

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
so when we come back so if I now for

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.600 
so when we come back so if I now for
example<00:03:58.270> switch<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.840> selection<00:04:02.350> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
example switch the selection of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.220 
example switch the selection of
basically<00:04:03.610> now<00:04:04.000> you're<00:04:04.210> calculating<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
basically now you're calculating the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.670 
basically now you're calculating the
entire<00:04:05.680> amount<00:04:06.070> of<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:07.090> polygons<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.470> not

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
entire amount of of polygons it's not

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.890 
entire amount of of polygons it's not
being<00:04:08.920> clever<00:04:09.370> let's<00:04:09.940> say<00:04:10.150> right<00:04:10.360> because<00:04:10.660> for

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
being clever let's say right because for

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.800 
being clever let's say right because for
example<00:04:10.930> if<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:12.130> look<00:04:12.340> farther<00:04:12.640> away<00:04:12.970> well<00:04:13.570> my<00:04:13.780> I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
example if I look farther away well my I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.200 
example if I look farther away well my I
cannot<00:04:14.470> distinguish<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.550> difference<00:04:15.940> right

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
cannot distinguish the difference right

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.740 
cannot distinguish the difference right
so<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:17.500> will<00:04:17.620> be<00:04:17.799> more<00:04:18.430> visible<00:04:18.640> on<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.239> front

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
so it will be more visible on the front

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.240 
so it will be more visible on the front
and<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.410> that's<00:04:20.590> where<00:04:20.770> you<00:04:20.890> add<00:04:21.010> more

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
and so that's where you add more

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.100 
and so that's where you add more
polygons<00:04:21.730> on<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> rest<00:04:22.240> we<00:04:22.360> try<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.630> discuss

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
polygons on the rest we try to discuss

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.900 
polygons on the rest we try to discuss
very<00:04:23.470> polygons<00:04:23.860> as<00:04:23.980> possible<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.580> make<00:04:24.730> a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
very polygons as possible to make a

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.030 
very polygons as possible to make a
smooth<00:04:25.510> frame<00:04:25.750> rate<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:26.170> as<00:04:26.290> soon<00:04:26.470> as<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.830> a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
smooth frame rate but as soon as I a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
smooth frame rate but as soon as I a
switch<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.760> back<00:04:27.880> on<00:04:29.400> see<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> image<00:04:30.760> becomes

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
switch it back on see the image becomes

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.980 
switch it back on see the image becomes
very<00:04:31.450> very<00:04:31.830> fluid<00:04:32.830> very<00:04:33.130> smooth<00:04:33.720> frame<00:04:34.720> with

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
very very fluid very smooth frame with

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.410 
very very fluid very smooth frame with
frame<00:04:35.680> rates<00:04:35.920> is<00:04:36.160> perfect

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.350 

so<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:42.440> just<00:04:42.710> this<00:04:42.830> couple<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.250> demos<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:44.240> know

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
so so just this couple of demos you know

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.260 
so so just this couple of demos you know
when<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:44.990> look<00:04:45.140> at<00:04:45.370> what<00:04:46.370> is<00:04:46.550> possible<00:04:46.970> today

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
when you look at what is possible today

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.200 
when you look at what is possible today
with<00:04:47.710> tegra<00:04:48.710> 4<00:04:48.950> which<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.580> really<00:04:49.880> incredible

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
with tegra 4 which is really incredible

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.050 
with tegra 4 which is really incredible
that<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:51.140> this<00:04:51.560> answer<00:04:52.010> several<00:04:52.790> new

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
that this the this answer several new

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.920 
that this the this answer several new
techniques<00:04:53.710> more<00:04:54.710> powerful<00:04:55.220> GPUs<00:04:55.790> ease<00:04:56.720> their

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
techniques more powerful GPUs ease their

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.480 
techniques more powerful GPUs ease their
way<00:04:57.080> for<00:04:57.320> them<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.500> transition<00:04:58.160> from<00:04:58.190> one

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
way for them to transition from one

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.550 
way for them to transition from one
platform<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.210> other<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.680> liberalism

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
platform to the other and the liberalism

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.050 
platform to the other and the liberalism
dramatically<00:05:03.560> better<00:05:03.830> than<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.670> best<00:05:04.820> thing

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
dramatically better than the best thing

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.430 
dramatically better than the best thing
we<00:05:05.210> can<00:05:05.360> do<00:05:05.480> today<00:05:09.250> that's<00:05:10.250> it
