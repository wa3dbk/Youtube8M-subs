00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
have the wrapped or fact this one is a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.140 
have the wrapped or fact this one is a
Utahraptor<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.239> discovered<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:46.959> Utah

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
Utahraptor which was discovered in Utah

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.340 
Utahraptor which was discovered in Utah
these<00:02:49.150> are<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.510> biggest<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.050> raptor

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
these are the biggest of the raptor

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.140 
these are the biggest of the raptor
firmly<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.950> our<00:02:51.430> 23<00:02:52.239> foot<00:02:52.660> long<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.700> according

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
firmly and our 23 foot long so according

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.540 
firmly and our 23 foot long so according
to<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.330> right<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.380> here<00:02:56.739> now<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.190> main

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
to the right in here now on the main

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.040 
to the right in here now on the main
amount<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.269> game<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.880> also<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.269> fastest

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
amount of the game and also the fastest

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.570 
amount of the game and also the fastest
so<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.380> think<00:03:02.560> we're<00:03:02.739> going<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.950> see<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.100> lot<00:03:03.160> of

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
so I think we're going to see a lot of

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.920 
so I think we're going to see a lot of
these<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.769> action<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.459> in<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.790> game<00:03:07.000> have

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
these in action on the in the game have

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.810 
these in action on the in the game have
a<00:03:07.959> look<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.380> says<00:03:08.709> despite<00:03:09.280> its<00:03:09.459> normally

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
a look it says despite its normally

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.240 
a look it says despite its normally
aggressive<00:03:10.150> nature<00:03:10.620> whether<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.769> main<00:03:11.920> melts

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
aggressive nature whether the main melts

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.250 
aggressive nature whether the main melts
blah<00:03:12.610> blah<00:03:12.850> blah<00:03:12.880> some<00:03:13.480> little<00:03:13.660> as<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:13.989> say

quite<00:04:22.180> interesting<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.840> see<00:04:22.960> how<00:04:23.020> that<00:04:23.140> works

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
quite interesting to see how that works

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.590 
quite interesting to see how that works
out<00:04:23.590> similar<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.640> just<00:04:24.790> you'd<00:04:25.150> think<00:04:25.360> it'd<00:04:25.570> be

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
out similar you just you'd think it'd be

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.750 
out similar you just you'd think it'd be
quite<00:04:25.840> slow<00:04:26.260> traveling<00:04:26.950> around<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.400> says<00:04:27.580> it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
quite slow traveling around it says it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.940 
quite slow traveling around it says it

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
knowledge and I'll buy that I discovered

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.670 
knowledge and I'll buy that I discovered
it<00:06:17.280> yet<00:06:17.430> but<00:06:18.270> I've<00:06:18.750> got<00:06:18.930> theory<00:06:19.200> about<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.440> art

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
it yet but I've got theory about the art

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.050 
it yet but I've got theory about the art
I<00:06:19.950> think<00:06:20.280> it's<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:21.800> giant<00:06:22.800> floating<00:06:23.220> spaceship

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
I think it's a giant floating spaceship

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.000 
I think it's a giant floating spaceship
with<00:06:24.360> some<00:06:24.480> aliens<00:06:24.840> been<00:06:24.960> collecting<00:06:25.470> species

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
with some aliens been collecting species

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.800 
with some aliens been collecting species
from<00:06:26.160> different<00:06:26.430> time<00:06:26.610> zones<00:06:26.940> who<00:06:27.570> knows

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
from different time zones who knows

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.350 
from different time zones who knows
that's<00:06:28.020> my<00:06:28.140> theory<00:06:28.850> but<00:06:29.850> yeah<00:06:30.030> if<00:06:30.090> anyone

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
that's my theory but yeah if anyone

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.690 
that's my theory but yeah if anyone
knows<00:06:30.480> better<00:06:30.720> let<00:06:30.930> me<00:06:30.960> know<00:06:31.280> but<00:06:32.280> right<00:06:32.400> thank
