understanding<00:00:06.799> why<00:00:07.450> certain<00:00:08.450> phenomena<00:00:08.990> I've

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
understanding why certain phenomena I've

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.190 
understanding why certain phenomena I've
seen<00:00:09.380> in<00:00:09.500> the<00:00:09.590> sky<00:00:09.889> is<00:00:10.450> often<00:00:11.450> not<00:00:11.630> very<00:00:11.690> easy

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
seen in the sky is often not very easy

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.220 
seen in the sky is often not very easy
to<00:00:12.769> do<00:00:13.089> let's<00:00:14.089> take<00:00:14.389> for<00:00:14.599> instance<00:00:14.660> the

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
to do let's take for instance the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.000 
to do let's take for instance the
situation<00:00:15.950> where<00:00:17.140> across<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.320> background<00:00:18.560> of

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
situation where across the background of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.600 
situation where across the background of
the<00:00:19.190> stars<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.060> planets<00:00:20.320> move<00:00:21.320> from<00:00:21.890> west<00:00:22.340> to

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
the stars the planets move from west to

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.850 
the stars the planets move from west to
east<00:00:22.720> but<00:00:23.720> now<00:00:23.870> you<00:00:23.930> might<00:00:24.260> say<00:00:24.440> to<00:00:24.500> me<00:00:24.650> now

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
east but now you might say to me now

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.860 
east but now you might say to me now
hold<00:00:25.040> on<00:00:25.250> they<00:00:25.460> actually<00:00:25.790> moving<00:00:26.000> from<00:00:26.330> east

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
hold on they actually moving from east

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.040 
hold on they actually moving from east
to<00:00:27.200> west<00:00:27.320> yes<00:00:28.280> that<00:00:28.520> is<00:00:28.640> true<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:29.180> is<00:00:29.360> over

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
to west yes that is true that is over

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.319 
to west yes that is true that is over
each<00:00:30.260> day<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.160> then<00:00:31.610> it's<00:00:31.760> because<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.300> earth

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
each day and then it's because the earth

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.040 
each day and then it's because the earth
is<00:00:32.809> turning<00:00:33.110> from<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.860> west<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.430> east<00:00:35.050> but

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
is turning from the west to the east but

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.980 
is turning from the west to the east but
if<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:36.320> looked<00:00:36.560> at<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:37.460> planet<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.210> followed

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
if you looked at a planet and followed

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.960 
if you looked at a planet and followed
it<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.290> night<00:00:39.470> by<00:00:39.710> night<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.190> would<00:00:40.670> see<00:00:40.820> that

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
it to night by night you would see that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.790 
it to night by night you would see that
against<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.390> background<00:00:41.810> of<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.079> stars<00:00:42.380> it

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
against the background of the stars it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.080 
against the background of the stars it
was<00:00:43.100> moving<00:00:43.370> in<00:00:43.670> an<00:00:44.060> easterly<00:00:44.780> direction<00:00:46.090> now

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
was moving in an easterly direction now

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.170 
was moving in an easterly direction now
that<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.470> what<00:00:48.890> we<00:00:49.070> can<00:00:49.220> expect<00:00:49.640> because<00:00:49.790> that

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
that is what we can expect because that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.050 
that is what we can expect because that
is<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.510> direction<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.520> move<00:00:52.820> that

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
is the direction that they move that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.560 
is the direction that they move that
their<00:00:53.210> orbit<00:00:53.480> around<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.960> Sun<00:00:54.399> so<00:00:55.450> every<00:00:56.450> now

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
their orbit around the Sun so every now

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.180 
their orbit around the Sun so every now
and<00:00:56.720> again<00:00:56.750> what<00:00:57.050> suddenly<00:00:57.260> happens<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.010> that

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
and again what suddenly happens is that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.260 
and again what suddenly happens is that
planet<00:00:58.940> suddenly<00:00:59.230> turns<00:01:00.230> around<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.270> starts

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
planet suddenly turns around and starts

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.109 
planet suddenly turns around and starts
coming<00:01:02.600> back<00:01:02.710> in<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.829> westward<00:01:04.369> direction<00:01:04.549> and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
coming back in a westward direction and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.450 
coming back in a westward direction and
then<00:01:05.780> shortly<00:01:06.320> after<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.920> turns<00:01:07.189> forward

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
then shortly after that it turns forward

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.490 
then shortly after that it turns forward
again<00:01:07.880> moves<00:01:08.510> again<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.110> an<00:01:09.200> easterly

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
again moves again in an easterly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.539 
again moves again in an easterly
direction<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.540> this<00:01:11.740> apparent<00:01:12.740> backwards

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
direction and this apparent backwards

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.090 
direction and this apparent backwards
motion<00:01:14.510> or<00:01:14.720> what<00:01:14.960> we<00:01:15.110> call<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> retrograde

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
motion or what we call a retrograde

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.200 
motion or what we call a retrograde
motion<00:01:17.170> puzzled<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.620> ancients<00:01:19.130> who<00:01:19.340> had<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
motion puzzled the ancients who had the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.490 
motion puzzled the ancients who had the
belief<00:01:20.330> then<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.020> earth<00:01:21.140> was<00:01:21.350> at<00:01:21.470> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
belief then that the earth was at the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.469 
belief then that the earth was at the
center<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.040> solar<00:01:22.190> system<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:22.880> they<00:01:23.360> had

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
center of the solar system and they had

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.039 
center of the solar system and they had
all<00:01:23.600> sorts<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.960> models<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.979> try<00:01:25.159> and

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
all sorts of models to try and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.530 
all sorts of models to try and
incorporate<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.470> retrograde<00:01:28.340> motion<00:01:28.700> so

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
incorporate this retrograde motion so

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.359 
incorporate this retrograde motion so
let's<00:01:30.020> think<00:01:30.290> about<00:01:30.440> what<00:01:30.770> causes<00:01:31.040> this

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
let's think about what causes this

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.020 
let's think about what causes this
retrograde<00:01:31.790> motion<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:33.530> my<00:01:34.280> recently

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030

June<00:01:40.729> 2012<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.030> address<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.229> easily<00:01:44.090> models

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
June 2012 I address how easily models

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.649 
June 2012 I address how easily models
can<00:01:45.720> help<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.229> overcome<00:01:47.119> hours<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.270> hours<00:01:48.540> of

can help to overcome hours and hours of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
can help to overcome hours and hours of
explanation<00:01:50.330> here<00:01:51.330> we<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.900> model<00:01:52.409> which

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
explanation here we have a model which

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.289 
explanation here we have a model which
helps<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> explain<00:01:53.640> retrograde<00:01:54.570> motion<00:01:56.299> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
helps to explain retrograde motion so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.749 
helps to explain retrograde motion so
here<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.080> earth<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.530> its<00:01:58.950> orbit<00:01:59.190> around

here we have earth in its orbit around

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.620 
here we have earth in its orbit around
the<00:02:00.180> Sun<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.430> looking<00:02:02.430> from<00:02:02.789> Earth<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.390> say

for instance Saturn against it would be
seen<00:02:06.210> against<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> background<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.259> say<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
slowly around as orbit around the Sun it

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.009 
slowly around as orbit around the Sun it
would<00:02:14.250> eventually<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> foreground<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
would eventually be in the foreground of

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.630 
would eventually be in the foreground of
that<00:02:16.140> star<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.830> foreground<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.459> that

that star then in the foreground of that

that star then in the foreground of that
anywhere<00:02:18.390> looking<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:18.870> Earth<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.680> now

anywhere looking from Earth but now

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.559 
anywhere looking from Earth but now
let's<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.280> happens<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.850> Earth<00:02:21.209> turns

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
let's see what happens as Earth turns

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.590 
let's see what happens as Earth turns
this<00:02:22.319> pointer<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.340> showing<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.910> direction<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
this pointer is showing the direction in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.290 
this pointer is showing the direction in
which<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:24.930> are<00:02:25.170> looking<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:26.790> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
which we are looking so what is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.400 
which we are looking so what is
happening<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.260> while<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:30.290> Saturn<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
happening is that while this Saturn is

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.309 
happening is that while this Saturn is
moving<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.860> direction<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:33.420> moving<00:02:33.900> in

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
moving in this direction it's moving in

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.840 
moving in this direction it's moving in
front<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.769> style<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> that's<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.610> that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
front of that style and that's down that

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.910 
front of that style and that's down that
star<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.569> all<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.959> sudden<00:02:37.319> watch<00:02:37.680> what

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
star but all of a sudden watch what

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.720 
star but all of a sudden watch what
happens<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.299> earth<00:02:39.450> moves<00:02:39.930> between<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
happens as the earth moves between the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
happens as the earth moves between the
artists<00:02:41.730> planet<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.049> inner<00:02:43.260> planet<00:02:43.590> you

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
artists planet and the inner planet you

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.060 
artists planet and the inner planet you
see<00:02:44.430> how<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:45.019> direction<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.440> line-of-sight

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
see how the direction the line-of-sight

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.479 
see how the direction the line-of-sight
changes<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.840> again<00:02:52.160> there<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.280> go

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
changes is to do that again there we go

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.449 
changes is to do that again there we go
Earth<00:02:53.700> now<00:02:54.000> moves<00:02:54.829> between<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:56.010> Sun<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
Earth now moves between the Sun and

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.210 
Earth now moves between the Sun and
Saturn<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:58.049> line-of-sight<00:02:58.769> suddenly

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
Saturn and the line-of-sight suddenly

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.930 
Saturn and the line-of-sight suddenly
changes<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.880> then<00:03:00.329> after<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.230> pennant

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
changes and then after that the pennant

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.130 
changes and then after that the pennant
resumes<00:03:02.940> its<00:03:03.209> apparent<00:03:04.310> eastward<00:03:05.310> motion

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
resumes its apparent eastward motion

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.259 
resumes its apparent eastward motion
along<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.200> background<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.950> stars<00:03:08.269> here

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
along the background of the stars here

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.569 
along the background of the stars here
we<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.540> again<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:11.359> for<00:03:12.359> a<00:03:12.390> short<00:03:12.690> while

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
we go again and for a short while

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.560 
we go again and for a short while
suddenly<00:03:14.579> against<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> background<00:03:15.359> of<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
suddenly against the background of the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.300 
suddenly against the background of the
stars

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
stars

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
stars
Saturn<00:03:17.310> moves<00:03:17.549> backwards<00:03:18.359> with<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> retrograde

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
Saturn moves backwards with a retrograde

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.910 
Saturn moves backwards with a retrograde
motion<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.329> see<00:03:21.510> from<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.109> model<00:03:22.290> that

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
motion so we can see from the model that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.130 
motion so we can see from the model that
it<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.519> purely<00:03:23.760> due<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.450> Earth's<00:03:24.630> motion

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
it is purely due to Earth's motion

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.750 
it is purely due to Earth's motion
around<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.220> Sun<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:28.220> because<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.430> seems

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
around the Sun that it because it seems

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.120 
around the Sun that it because it seems
that<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.720> planet<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.260> moving<00:03:31.470> backwards

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that the planet is moving backwards

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.710 
that the planet is moving backwards
against<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> Stars

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
against the Stars

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.660 
against the Stars
in<00:03:33.930> fact<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.380> planet<00:03:34.739> has<00:03:35.040> kept<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.549> moving

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
in fact the planet has kept on moving

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.819 
in fact the planet has kept on moving
very<00:03:36.060> steadily<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.660> its<00:03:37.140> orbit<00:03:37.470> around<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
very steadily in its orbit around the

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.069 
very steadily in its orbit around the
Sun<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.459> only<00:03:38.640> due<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.880> our<00:03:39.150> motion<00:03:39.450> that

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
Sun and it's only due to our motion that

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.380 
Sun and it's only due to our motion that
it<00:03:40.260> apparently<00:03:40.620> seems<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.549> move<00:03:41.700> backwards<00:03:42.239> I

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
it apparently seems to move backwards I

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.180 
it apparently seems to move backwards I
hope<00:03:42.900> that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
hope that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.890 
hope that
helps<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.790> explain<00:03:44.090> which<00:03:44.510> for<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.720> great

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
helps to explain which for a great

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:53.180 
helps to explain which for a great
motion
