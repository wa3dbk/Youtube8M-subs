movement<00:00:09.340> of<00:00:09.430> the<00:00:09.550> planets<00:00:09.790> Neptune<00:00:10.600> the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
movement of the planets Neptune the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.650 
movement of the planets Neptune the
mystic<00:00:11.830> and<00:00:12.070> I<00:00:12.550> think<00:00:12.790> this<00:00:13.030> is<00:00:13.300> the<00:00:13.480> most

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
mystic and I think this is the most

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:35.060 
mystic and I think this is the most
stunning<00:00:14.290> movement<00:00:14.830> of<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.400> entire<00:00:15.790> score

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.770 

it<00:00:36.070> also<00:00:36.310> reveals<00:00:36.550> what<00:00:37.090> an<00:00:37.180> incredible

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
it also reveals what an incredible

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.070 
it also reveals what an incredible
risk-taker<00:00:38.440> Holst<00:00:39.040> was<00:00:39.450> having<00:00:40.450> presented<00:00:40.750> us

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
risk-taker Holst was having presented us

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.170 
risk-taker Holst was having presented us
with<00:00:41.260> your<00:00:41.410> Kestrel<00:00:41.920> fireworks<00:00:42.400> of<00:00:42.550> Mars<00:00:42.850> at

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
with your Kestrel fireworks of Mars at

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.480 
with your Kestrel fireworks of Mars at
the<00:00:43.270> beginning<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:43.930> Jupiter<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.130> middle

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
the beginning and Jupiter in the middle

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.520 
the beginning and Jupiter in the middle
of<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.700> suite<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.600> entire<00:00:46.900> journey<00:00:47.200> would<00:00:47.470> be

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
of the suite the entire journey would be

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.160 
of the suite the entire journey would be
framed<00:00:47.950> perfectly<00:00:48.700> with<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.180> rousing<00:00:49.810> finale

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
framed perfectly with a rousing finale

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:10.230 
framed perfectly with a rousing finale
but<00:00:50.980> Holst<00:00:51.490> does<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.180> exact<00:00:52.660> opposite

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.010 

I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:12.310> Neptune's<00:01:12.820> orchestration<00:01:13.720> is<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
I think Neptune's orchestration is the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.920 
I think Neptune's orchestration is the
most<00:01:14.200> exquisite<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.189> entire<00:01:15.520> suite<00:01:15.939> every

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
most exquisite in the entire suite every

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.600 
most exquisite in the entire suite every
instrument<00:01:17.320> choice<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:18.009> carefully

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
instrument choice is carefully

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.600 
instrument choice is carefully
calculated<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.540> perfectly<00:01:20.350> balanced<00:01:20.950> such

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
calculated and perfectly balanced such

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.149 
calculated and perfectly balanced such
as<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.880> bass<00:01:22.119> flute<00:01:22.450> casting<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.409> dark<00:01:23.439> shadow

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
as the bass flute casting a dark shadow

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.340 
as the bass flute casting a dark shadow
underneath<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.909> regular<00:01:25.390> concert<00:01:25.840> flute<00:01:25.990> are

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
underneath the regular concert flute are

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.039 
underneath the regular concert flute are
the<00:01:26.860> magical<00:01:27.399> shimmer<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.939> radiates<00:01:28.600> from

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
the magical shimmer that radiates from

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.789 
the magical shimmer that radiates from
the<00:01:29.229> harps<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.390> adventurous<00:01:31.960> orchestration

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
the harps this adventurous orchestration

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.999 
the harps this adventurous orchestration
produced<00:01:33.460> music<00:01:33.880> which<00:01:34.030> today<00:01:34.420> almost<00:01:35.200> 100

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
produced music which today almost 100

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.450 
produced music which today almost 100
years<00:01:36.039> later<00:01:36.280> still<00:01:37.270> feels<00:01:37.780> futuristic<00:01:38.679> but<00:01:39.429> I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
years later still feels futuristic but I

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.310 
years later still feels futuristic but I
guess<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.880> connection<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.630> reinforced<00:01:41.259> by

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
guess that connection is reinforced by

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.529 
guess that connection is reinforced by
the<00:01:41.470> fact<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:42.100> Hollywood<00:01:42.819> composers<00:01:43.360> have

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
the fact that Hollywood composers have

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.230 
the fact that Hollywood composers have
clearly<00:01:44.049> been<00:01:44.319> influenced<00:01:44.890> by<00:01:44.950> Holst<00:01:45.520> it's

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
clearly been influenced by Holst it's

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.120 
clearly been influenced by Holst it's
certainly<00:01:46.569> not<00:01:46.780> difficult<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.470> imagine<00:01:47.709> this

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
certainly not difficult to imagine this

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.669 
certainly not difficult to imagine this
