have to say this phones first reactions
are<00:04:58.570> this<00:04:58.780> looks<00:04:58.960> like<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.200> moment<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.770> it's<00:05:00.550> a

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
are this looks like the moment to it's a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.950 
are this looks like the moment to it's a
little<00:05:00.760> smaller<00:05:01.090> little<00:05:01.390> sleeker<00:05:01.780> it's

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
little smaller little sleeker it's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.100 
little smaller little sleeker it's
running<00:05:02.230> android<00:05:02.590> 2.1<00:05:03.960> probably<00:05:04.960> that

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
running android 2.1 probably that

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.300 
running android 2.1 probably that
combined<00:05:05.470> with<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.740> 800<00:05:06.100> megahertz

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.890 
combined with the 800 megahertz
processor<00:05:06.610> i'm<00:05:07.120> definitely<00:05:07.510> going<00:05:07.600> to<00:05:07.690> think

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
processor i'm definitely going to think

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.330 
processor i'm definitely going to think
that<00:05:07.960> it's<00:05:08.200> going<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.350> be<00:05:08.470> running<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.890> little

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
that it's going to be running a little

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.280 
that it's going to be running a little
bit<00:05:09.490> faster<00:05:09.700> than<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.150> moment<00:05:10.330> will<00:05:11.050> try<00:05:11.230> to

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
bit faster than the moment will try to

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.100 
bit faster than the moment will try to
get<00:05:11.500> will<00:05:12.040> try<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.250> find<00:05:12.400> out<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:13.120> moment<00:05:13.960> here

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
get will try to find out a moment here

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.710 
get will try to find out a moment here
we'll<00:05:14.200> try<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.410> do<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.650> review<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:16.330> moment

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
we'll try to do a review the moment

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.590 
we'll try to do a review the moment
