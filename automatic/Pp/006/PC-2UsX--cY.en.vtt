I dunno so it says Fisher so maybe a
Fisher<00:02:58.290> plow<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.030> then<00:03:00.030> there's<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.599> thing

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
Fisher plow and then there's that thing

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
going to leave it running so you can

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.590 
going to leave it running so you can
hear<00:04:20.220> hop<00:04:21.220> down

compression ignition activated and

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.550 
compression ignition activated and
here's<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> power<00:04:30.010> right<00:04:30.310> here<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:32.020> for<00:04:32.320> an

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
here's the power right here so for an

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.970 
here's the power right here so for an
inexpensive<00:04:35.280> workhorse<00:04:36.280> here<00:04:36.520> top<00:04:36.850> edge<00:04:37.090> I

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
inexpensive workhorse here top edge I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.320 
inexpensive workhorse here top edge I
guess<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.130> has<00:04:39.250> all<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.490> proper<00:04:39.880> bitch<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.210> was

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
guess it has all the proper bitch it was

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.460 
guess it has all the proper bitch it was
working<00:04:40.660> when<00:04:40.690> we<00:04:40.870> dropped<00:04:41.110> then<00:04:41.380> they

working when we dropped then they

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.220 
working when we dropped then they
dropped<00:04:41.740> itself
