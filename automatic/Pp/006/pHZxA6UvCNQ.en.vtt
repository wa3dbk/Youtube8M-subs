00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
for that or the annotation or whatever

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
for that or the annotation or whatever

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
for once case they charge maybe 30 30

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
for once case they charge maybe 30 30
something<00:01:43.170> cents<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.159> plus<00:01:44.399> add<00:01:44.670> six<00:01:45.030> cents
