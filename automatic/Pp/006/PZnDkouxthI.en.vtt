00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.389
 hello how about youtube friends from 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.070
 Greetings your friend Luis and good in this 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.080
 extreme video a very good application 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.400
 which will help us to access 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.590
 our applications in a way 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.450
 much faster and good this application 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.610
 it's called touch or it's available from 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.550
 free of charge in the app store has a 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.980
 size of almost 2 megabytes and works from 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.590
 android 2.1 onwards or that then 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.930
 we go quickly to the play this as 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.750
 tell them is this touch app and 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.070
 let's open it ok then it's the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.260
 weak moment and we can 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.110
 find this screen in the interface 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.450
 of the application where in the first 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.440
 option because we have the option of adjustments 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.620
 we give here to you to activate 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.870
 or disable this application simply 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.329
 we mark or unmark the first option 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.400
 and when we mark it, we see a 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.990
 small icon on this side 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.030
 which is the one that will serve us for 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.360
 access applications in a way 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.420
 well much faster and if we want 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 deactivate it simply deactivate ok 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.540
 then this we are going to return 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.790
 to desktop mode that then as 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.290
 we see we have a dot here always if 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.240
 we press on top of it it's going to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 activate the option that told them that it is 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.060
 this is the option where we can 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.400
 find the screen lock 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.470
 multitasking take today directly to 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.620
 home or we can even find 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.730
 flashlight today directly to the subjects 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.410
 what are these ok then this one yes 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.300
 we press the home key or 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.530
 basically is giving us to take to the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.180
 initial screen the same if we want to go 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.610
 with whip 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.890
 the tasks in the background are going to 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.650
 Take the tasks in the background 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.140
 then as I tell you an application 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.960
 quite useful the truth 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.540
 from this side we can find the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.140
 favorites that would be this 2 the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.009
 applications that I can talk about we use more 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.420
 so if we want to open a 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.430
 application we just press there 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.090
 one more index and we can add 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.750
 all the applications this that we 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.390
 we want it to look there not then 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.400
 let's add anything else and we give in 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.180
 ok and we will add all the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.010
 options 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.290
 ok equally on this side 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.390
 we will have what valenciana the accesses 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.410
 direct the doubles that has been the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.030
 wifi memory brightness in airplane mode 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.010
 bluetooth among others more 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.590
 ok just this side gives us the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.440
 percentage the battery that gives us the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.450
 direct call option and the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.630
 option to go directly to location 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.790
 the message inbox ok 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.520
 then as I tell you and from this side 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.040
 we can place this 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.590
 the weather a weather widget that yes 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.220
 we want this because we can 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.970
 apply simply choose our 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 our location 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.740
 we give the ok the application could the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.750
 search ok 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.200
 then how do we see this here gives us the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 option d 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.330
 of time ok then how do I tell them a 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.920
 application was pretty good that if 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.379
 us when I say if we want to go to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.760
 subject takes us directly here and the 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.459
 advantage of this application what 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.319
 I also like I liked it a lot 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.239
 that we can apply issues like these 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.150
 who see here I have downloaded some not 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.730
 for example, if we want to apply it 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.180
 we simply give in to apply and we 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.780
 change the appearance of our 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.020
 shortcuts as in this case ok 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.959
 and now the calendar calls messages 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.290
 from here we can find what they see 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.700
 being this time the weather state 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.550
 we can find shortcuts 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.200
 just as we saw it ok then that 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.510
 side we press this icon take us 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 all the shortcuts with what I say 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.260
 a really useful application the truth 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.880
 that I recommend it a lot and this 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.739
 then there are more topics than if you 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.600
 they want to download one they just give 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.139
 in download it takes you directly to the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.690
 play this and download it then ok 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.019
 this one really is a very good one 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.019
 application 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.310
 on this side as I say it I downloaded 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.190
