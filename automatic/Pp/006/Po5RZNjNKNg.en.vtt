00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 the staff here plus a tide 2.0 arrived 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.000
 for people here FIAC workshop're this 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 car can see here his head is 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.160
 practically zeroed to the customer 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.439
 paid to be able to make the car engine 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 It's color in the house, even the old story. 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 average of 8 thousand reais and the mechanic 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 and told the customer that the problem 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.219
 was in the electrical part of the car and the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.399
 car does not work and went out of the case 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.800
 left the mechanic there without 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.540
 Customer brought the car to us. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
 after a long period of time 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.829
 spend some workshops and get here 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 You will find the first the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.710
 sindepan / ms here we go there guys 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 can see here the limit of the mind in the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:07.700
 clock that has 10 up there will arrive 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 at zero right a little bit alone 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.789
 beauty is back there, the point is there 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.429
 You have to get here next to us. 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.009
 that check the point of the commands 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.829
 reminds us of the very intelligent people who 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.719
 would you ask me but need to 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.020
 put the tool in command 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.149
 We have the necessities if we can 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.670
 requires the tools to command because there are 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.170
 the need to put the tools 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.509
 no, I do not know 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.179
 He's the one who'll get the tools. 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.929
 clarifying once again the question of 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.159
 folks 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:48.130
 this engine 2.0 aspirated and left with 142 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.649
 horses and 126 horses summarize do not have 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.189
 two types of tool for him is there 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.229
 142 horses are one to 127 horses and another 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.069
 and we will try to put the tool 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.239
 here o 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:07.719
 so he already sees that he does not give a certain tac and 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:09.069
 fully sure leak totally off 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.030
 are right here 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.489
 the right admission and also totally 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.579
 outside we will generate the engine a 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.440
 gives a little bit back 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.500
 just for you to see how it has to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.730
 fit the tool is we will 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.590
 spin engine fit the tool there 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.819
 good 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.049
 This is 127 horses from here the difference 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:41.709
 which has a clearance between command and 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:46.290
 127 horsepower tool and the tool that 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.739
 he was using era of 142 horses 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.099
 on here 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.280
 the tool 127 horses as maybe a 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.099
 little there married perfectly table 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.099
 so remembering this video again 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.609
 that we saw need the tools 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.459
 sure you can not use it as 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.950
 put tool is doing even 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.500
 marking because it gives here 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.560
 q it has equal home here and he's so 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.199
 you have to really use the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.860
 tools here is another thing 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.340
 clock comparator 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.410
 it's something other than certain people's tool 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.420
 It's a good idea to put the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.910
 another model that does not even 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.930
 week to see if the 1.8 serves 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.930
 in this car 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.990
 No, it's no good and something else. 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.930
 142 horses 126 horsepower tool 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.210
 have no tool to do 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.770
 the service does not do service that I will have 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.800
 I came here to do and dismantle the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 Why do not you try it? 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.900
 one thing I'm sure my 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.350
 new album then a service that does not 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.510
 it got cheap was excuse the word but 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.940
 with the shit that neither functional car 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.959
 customer could not even walk with 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.030
 calculate did not get ridiculous it 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.020
 with the lack of professionals in total 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.020
 Let's take the folks.
