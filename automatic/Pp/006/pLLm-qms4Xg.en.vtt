 I remember well when they named me 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.590
 reinier already spent a lot of time 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.690
 I was a teenager like any

 another and be part of a team like 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.170
 the power rangers changed me forever 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.869
 being the green rangers was an adventure 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.200
 incomparable I learned the code of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.049
 dragons brotherhood dedication respect and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.360
 cooperation was the most exciting time 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.399
 of my life clearly until I became 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.790
 in the rangers white friends that was 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.619
 incredible although I had to work hard 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 so be it then I learned other values 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.740
 of the dragon discipline trust 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.909
 and respect for oneself but that happened 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.150
 other rangers continued with the work 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.399
 from my group and I continued with my things I went 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.619
 to the university I studied and got a 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.619
 teaching diploma was always my vocation 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.409
 you know and I moved to read side just for 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.409
 find a calm and peaceful place 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.409
 calmed down 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.210
 there was never calm 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.900
 the only thing capable of stopping me that was 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.060
 guessed the power rangers but should 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.280
 be a new generation of rangers with 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.750
 your own skills and abilities and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.880
 it was so with him 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.250

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.180
 football with a huge amount of strength and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.520
 speed that will go is a creative girl 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.290
 list and talented ethan's skill 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.510
 with computers he turned it into the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.610
 ideal candidate to pilot a short or 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.950
 a moore abduction together form a team 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.570
 incredible that nobody can stop have 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.670
 the courage to face the enemy more 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.370
 ruthless and believe me they could 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.200
 prove it in my opinion are some of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.090
 the best power rangers wow 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.910
 but of course we may need help 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.280
 even a power rangers makes me happy 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.560
 have helped them by doing the work of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.990
 Black rangers had spent a lot of time 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.030
 without being power rangers and I confess that 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.610
 It was easy but going back to the ring was the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.900
 correct decision had new 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.300
 powers that he had to learn to master 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.190
 to face a new enemy but 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.020
 I always liked the challenges I have 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.880
 the vrac I can the joint power of 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.590
 wind fire and water 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.680
 become the black rangers was the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.210
 cusp of my career as power rangers 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.520
 being a power rangers means being part of 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.040
 of something important to be part of a 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.690
 tradition of a lineage of people who 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.700
 have done their best to protect the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.830
 people use their powers to do the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.960
 well and keep the secret of the power 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.900
 rangers I'm glad I was part of 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.939
 this 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.459
 I'm talking too much better I go back to 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:38.439
