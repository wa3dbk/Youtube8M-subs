 peninsula as a tropical storm but not 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.010
 it is ruled out that you can change both your 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.760
 trajectory as its category due to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.820
 who has had a behavior 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.380
 capricious at this time they have 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.240
 activated and all the protocols in 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.670
 baja california south but some

 listening to the information you give us with

 in the conditions as it has been 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.070
