00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
my case which was over here try to land

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
my case which was over here try to land
around<00:00:30.869> where<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> landed<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> kind<00:00:32.460> of

around where I landed so you kind of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.920 
around where I landed so you kind of
have<00:00:32.640> an<00:00:32.759> idea<00:00:33.030> where<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> ladder<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> because

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
have an idea where the ladder is because

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.330 
have an idea where the ladder is because
it<00:00:34.050> needs<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> specific<00:00:34.649> ladder

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it needs to be the specific ladder

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.610 
it needs to be the specific ladder
because<00:00:36.180> we're<00:00:36.360> kind<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> gonna<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.590> a

because we're kind of gonna get into a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
because we're kind of gonna get into a
corner<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.760> teleport<00:00:39.360> into<00:00:39.780> it

just kind of glitch into it as you can

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.740 
just kind of glitch into it as you can
see<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> fell<00:01:04.739> through<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.000> guy's<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
see I fell through and this guy's if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.179 
see I fell through and this guy's if you
fell<00:01:07.049> through<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.890> means<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
fell through like this that means you

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.520 
fell through like this that means you
failed<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.780> means<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> didn't<00:01:10.290> work

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
failed because that means it didn't work

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.260 
failed because that means it didn't work
so<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> recommend<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.850> having<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
so what I recommend is having a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
so what I recommend is having a
helicopter<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:13.290> beside<00:01:13.650> where<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> spawn

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
helicopter right beside where you spawn

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740 
helicopter right beside where you spawn
out<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> FIB<00:01:15.060> building<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> don't

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
out of the FIB building so you don't

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.170 
out of the FIB building so you don't
need<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> new<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.439> every<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:17.030> but<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
need to get a new one every time but it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
need to get a new one every time but it
will<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> few<00:01:18.930> tries<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.770> why

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
will take a few tries I don't know why

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.440 
will take a few tries I don't know why
my<00:01:20.070> friend<00:01:20.400> wouldn't<00:01:20.670> fall<00:01:20.909> through<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:21.330> would

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
my friend wouldn't fall through he would

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.030 
my friend wouldn't fall through he would
just<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> retell<00:01:22.229> apart<00:01:22.560> back<00:01:22.740> he's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
just kind of retell apart back he's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.399

gotta<00:01:58.740> keep<00:01:59.340> trying<00:01:59.750> it<00:02:00.750> should<00:02:00.930> take<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.290> 2

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
gotta keep trying it should take about 2

gotta keep trying it should take about 2
to<00:02:01.799> 3<00:02:01.979> tries<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:03.060> first<00:02:03.329> try

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to 3 tries if you get on your first try

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
to 3 tries if you get on your first try
it's<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.439> too<00:02:04.680> hard<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.189> your

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it's it's not too hard to get on your

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.869 
it's it's not too hard to get on your
first<00:02:05.520> try<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.420> wouldn't<00:02:07.429> get<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:08.550> hopes<00:02:08.580> up

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
first try but I wouldn't get my hopes up

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.820 
first try but I wouldn't get my hopes up
too<00:02:09.060> high<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.440> FIB

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
too high for it and this is the FIB

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
too high for it and this is the FIB
building<00:02:11.190> now<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.670> understand<00:02:12.270> how<00:02:12.420> this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
building now I don't understand how this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.460 
building now I don't understand how this
works

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
works

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
works
I<00:02:13.530> don't<00:02:13.770> know<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:13.950> Rockstar<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.670> didn't

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
I don't know if Rockstar just didn't

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.810 
I don't know if Rockstar just didn't
really<00:02:15.120> develop<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.690> too<00:02:15.840> much<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.350> if<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.670> is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
really develop it too much or if this is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.430 
really develop it too much or if this is
kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.570> storyline<00:02:18.930> because<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.320> don't

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
kind of in the storyline because I don't

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.750 
kind of in the storyline because I don't
know<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.650> guys<00:02:19.770> know<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.070> storyline<00:02:20.430> but

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
know if you guys know in storyline but

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.270 
know if you guys know in storyline but
the<00:02:20.880> FIB<00:02:21.270> big<00:02:21.450> fib<00:02:22.170> building<00:02:22.710> gets<00:02:22.890> burnt<00:02:23.100> down

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the FIB big fib building gets burnt down

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
the FIB big fib building gets burnt down
in<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.490> storyline<00:02:23.820> but<00:02:24.300> some<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:25.470> doesn't

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
in the storyline but some that doesn't

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.650 
in the storyline but some that doesn't
really<00:02:25.800> make<00:02:25.980> sense<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.480> Rockstar<00:02:27.480> said

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
really make sense because Rockstar said

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.020 
really make sense because Rockstar said
themselves<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.350> GT<00:02:28.620> online<00:02:28.710> takes<00:02:29.310> place<00:02:29.670> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
themselves that GT online takes place I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.170 
themselves that GT online takes place I
think<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.630> month<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.020> two<00:02:31.140> before<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:32.580> gta5

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
think a month or two before the gta5

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
think a month or two before the gta5
storyline<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.080> don't<00:02:34.290> really<00:02:34.410> understand

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
storyline so I don't really understand

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040 
storyline so I don't really understand
how<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.310> works<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:36.120> anyways<00:02:36.570> it's<00:02:36.870> either

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
how that works but anyways it's either

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.440 
how that works but anyways it's either
burnt<00:02:37.410> down<00:02:37.650> or<00:02:38.070> rocks<00:02:38.910> artists<00:02:39.240> didn't

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
burnt down or rocks artists didn't

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.640 
burnt down or rocks artists didn't
really<00:02:39.600> furnish<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.440> didn't

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
really furnish it because they didn't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.320 
really furnish it because they didn't
really<00:02:40.770> want<00:02:40.860> people<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.670> get<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.940> there<00:02:42.120> not

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
really want people to get in there not

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.850 
really want people to get in there not
one<00:02:42.630> didn't<00:02:42.900> want<00:02:43.110> people<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.470> get<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.710> there

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
one didn't want people to get in there

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.050 
one didn't want people to get in there
but<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.040> didn't<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:44.370> didn't<00:02:44.610> really<00:02:44.700> expect

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
but I didn't they didn't really expect

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.940 
but I didn't they didn't really expect
people<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.770> know<00:02:46.890> it
