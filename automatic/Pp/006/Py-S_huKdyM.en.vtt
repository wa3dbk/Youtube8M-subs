over time it's not a huge effect at
first<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.840> it'll<00:01:07.290> become<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.530> bigger<00:01:07.830> issue<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
first but it'll become a bigger issue a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.310 
first but it'll become a bigger issue a
little<00:01:08.670> bit<00:01:08.760> later<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> fight<00:01:09.630> now

little bit later on in the fight now
there's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> whole<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> crazy<00:01:11.430> stuff<00:01:11.670> going

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there's a whole lot of crazy stuff going

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
there's a whole lot of crazy stuff going
on<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.200> you'll<00:01:13.320> notice<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.830> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
on here one thing you'll notice is that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
on here one thing you'll notice is that
if<00:01:14.280> you're<00:01:14.820> familiar<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.330> sorcerer<00:01:15.840> healing

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
if you're familiar with sorcerer healing

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
if you're familiar with sorcerer healing
there's<00:01:16.409> been<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> couple<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> buffs<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.030> my

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
there's been a couple of buffs to my

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990 
there's been a couple of buffs to my
class<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.580> way<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.610> effective

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
class so I'm actually way more effective

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
class so I'm actually way more effective
than<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> should<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.990> pts<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:23.009> there's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
than I should be and pts also there's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.969 
than I should be and pts also there's
there's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.530> level

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
there's a way you can get you know level

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.990 
there's a way you can get you know level
55<00:01:26.369> gear<00:01:26.729> right<00:01:27.000> away<00:01:27.270> which<00:01:27.600> helps<00:01:28.110> but

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
55 gear right away which helps but

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
55 gear right away which helps but
basically<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.210> fight<00:01:30.659> itself<00:01:31.049> isn't<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
basically this fight itself isn't that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
basically this fight itself isn't that
difficult<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.610> mostly<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> straight<00:01:33.329> tank

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
difficult if it's mostly a straight tank

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
difficult if it's mostly a straight tank
and<00:01:33.750> spank<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> confusing<00:01:34.920> if

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and spank but it's kind of confusing if

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
and spank but it's kind of confusing if
you<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.329> know<00:01:36.420> watching<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.530> not

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you are you know watching if you're not

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.109 
you are you know watching if you're not
moving<00:01:38.009> around<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> group<00:01:38.880> you're

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
moving around with the group you're

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.060 
moving around with the group you're
going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> left<00:01:39.689> behind<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.530> that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
going to get left behind and that's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
going to get left behind and that's
pretty<00:01:41.579> much<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> way<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.299> end<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:42.659> wiping

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
pretty much the way you end up wiping

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.240 
pretty much the way you end up wiping
because<00:01:43.259> you'll<00:01:43.409> hit<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.649> rage<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.070> too<00:01:44.189> many

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
because you'll hit in rage if too many

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.730 
because you'll hit in rage if too many
people<00:01:44.369> die<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.570> stay<00:01:45.840> underneath<00:01:46.500> this

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
people die if you stay underneath this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
people die if you stay underneath this
shield<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> environmental<00:01:47.970> shield

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
shield this is that environmental shield

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
shield this is that environmental shield
that<00:01:48.570> somebody<00:01:48.840> popped<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> stay<00:01:50.189> under

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that somebody popped if you stay under

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
that somebody popped if you stay under
the<00:01:50.490> shield<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.360> stay<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> group

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the shield and you stay with the group

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.380 
the shield and you stay with the group
you<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.579> fine<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.180> fall

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you will be just fine but if you fall

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
you will be just fine but if you fall
behind<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.290> lost<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> sandstorm

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
behind you can get lost in the sandstorm

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.730 
behind you can get lost in the sandstorm
basically<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.420> make<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.290> screen<00:01:58.590> go

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
black you'll see it a little bit later i

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.190 
black you'll see it a little bit later i
think<00:02:00.450> i<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.110> caught

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
think i actually get caught

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590 
think i actually get caught
but<00:02:02.920> your<00:02:03.549> screen<00:02:03.789> will<00:02:03.909> go<00:02:03.939> black<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.509> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
but your screen will go black and it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.359

lead us through it a little bit but they

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.640 
lead us through it a little bit but they
didn't<00:03:37.630> really<00:03:37.900> explain<00:03:38.139> it<00:03:38.230> before<00:03:38.560> it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.500 
didn't really explain it before it
started<00:03:38.889> happening<00:03:39.150> you're<00:03:40.150> gonna<00:03:40.269> want<00:03:40.480> to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
started happening you're gonna want to

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.879 
started happening you're gonna want to
avoid<00:03:40.780> those<00:03:41.049> yellow<00:03:41.350> circles<00:03:41.739> because

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
avoid those yellow circles because

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.280 
avoid those yellow circles because
they'll<00:03:42.130> slow<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.850> down<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.049> get<00:03:44.230> back

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
they'll slow you down but you get back

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.190

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
into the raid and keep fighting in it

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.830 
into the raid and keep fighting in it
basically<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.340> matter<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.180> whether<00:03:49.389> during

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
basically is a matter of whether during

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.390 
basically is a matter of whether during
those<00:03:50.049> transition<00:03:50.590> phases<00:03:50.799> where<00:03:51.099> it<00:03:51.190> says

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
those transition phases where it says

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.819 
those transition phases where it says
that<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.239> environmental<00:03:52.959> suppression

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
that the the environmental suppression

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.339 
that the the environmental suppression
thingy<00:03:54.340> or<00:03:54.819> shield<00:03:55.239> or<00:03:55.450> whatever<00:03:55.690> has<00:03:56.109> run<00:03:56.319> out

thingy or shield or whatever has run out

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.159 
thingy or shield or whatever has run out
of<00:03:56.470> juice<00:03:56.590> if<00:03:57.579> you're<00:03:57.819> able<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.359> move<00:03:58.750> from

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
of juice if you're able to move from

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.920 
of juice if you're able to move from
spot<00:03:59.859> to<00:03:59.889> spot<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.549> not<00:04:01.150> leave<00:04:01.690> anybody

spot to spot and not leave anybody

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.809 
spot to spot and not leave anybody
behind<00:04:02.160> you'll<00:04:03.160> pretty<00:04:03.310> much<00:04:03.400> win<00:04:03.669> because

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
behind you'll pretty much win because

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.430 
behind you'll pretty much win because
this<00:04:04.030> guy<00:04:04.150> doesn't<00:04:04.389> seem<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.840> hit<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.169> hard

really<00:04:08.530> crazy<00:04:08.829> mechanics

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
really crazy mechanics

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.830 
really crazy mechanics
other<00:04:09.980> than<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.310> movement<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:10.940> other<00:04:11.600> than

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
other than the movement and other than

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.890 
other than the movement and other than
that<00:04:12.020> not<00:04:12.230> back<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.450> otherwise<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:14.750> you're

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
that not back so otherwise if you're

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.509 
that not back so otherwise if you're
able<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.260> just<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.650> know<00:04:15.710> hang<00:04:15.980> on<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.400> can

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
able to just you know hang on you can

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.940 
able to just you know hang on you can
probably<00:04:16.760> do<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:17.630> with<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> pickup<00:04:18.530> group<00:04:18.739> now

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
probably do this with a pickup group now

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.620 
probably do this with a pickup group now
this<00:04:19.160> operation<00:04:19.760> does<00:04:19.970> start<00:04:20.239> getting<00:04:20.480> more

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
this operation does start getting more

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.230 
this operation does start getting more
difficult<00:04:20.750> with<00:04:21.140> other<00:04:21.320> bosses<00:04:21.560> I'd<00:04:22.400> say<00:04:22.700> once

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
difficult with other bosses I'd say once

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.820 
difficult with other bosses I'd say once
you<00:04:23.300> get<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.570> fourth<00:04:23.810> boss<00:04:24.080> it's<00:04:24.350> really

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
you get to the fourth boss it's really

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.350 
you get to the fourth boss it's really
kind<00:04:25.010> of<00:04:25.070> crazy<00:04:25.340> but<00:04:25.580> there<00:04:25.730> are<00:04:25.790> seven<00:04:26.150> bosses

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
kind of crazy but there are seven bosses

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.320 
kind of crazy but there are seven bosses
in<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.750> new<00:04:26.980> operation<00:04:27.980> we'll<00:04:28.700> see<00:04:28.940> if<00:04:28.970> they

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
in the new operation we'll see if they

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.600 
in the new operation we'll see if they
end<00:04:29.540> up<00:04:29.720> tuning<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.590> for<00:04:30.920> damage<00:04:31.340> or<00:04:31.460> anything

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
end up tuning it for damage or anything

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.570 
end up tuning it for damage or anything
like<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.170> future<00:04:33.350> but<00:04:33.830> at<00:04:34.400> this

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
like that in the future but at this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.340 
like that in the future but at this
point<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.030> very<00:04:35.300> doable<00:04:35.570> with<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:35.990> pickup

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
point it's very doable with a pickup

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.920 
point it's very doable with a pickup
group<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.370> would<00:04:38.000> highly<00:04:38.300> recommend<00:04:38.330> if
