00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
on 580 for me was an enjoyable chapter

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.210

as<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.990> really<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.500> progression<00:02:30.950> we<00:02:31.040> saw

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
as I really like the progression we saw

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.090 
as I really like the progression we saw
with<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.550> jihad<00:02:32.420> brethren<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> all<00:02:33.920> that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
stuff but I also kind of thought it was

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.570 
stuff but I also kind of thought it was
another<00:02:36.020> set<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.710> chapter<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.340> didn't

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
another set of chapter and I didn't

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.010 
another set of chapter and I didn't
really<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.270> thought<00:02:38.570> we<00:02:38.780> were<00:02:38.900> ready
