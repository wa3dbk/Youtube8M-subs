 just oh well such a podcast which 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.810
 crazy but it's like an appeal to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 celebration until the salute is cool 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.619

 followers 5,000 followers for someone 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.530
 it's like I always noticed that in each 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.959
 video in any form from any author but 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.240

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.590

 that's all yes modest life vast 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.750
 student that's really the difference 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.070
 1000 subscribers or 5000 subscribers 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.019
 Here is my personal perception of the situation 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.819
 which instrumental channel and youtube 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.530
 she changed a lot when I was 1500 I 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.540
 looked so views more 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.670
 followers more views more 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.130
 more subscribers now me more 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.630
 interested in the reaction of the audience to the new 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.519
 video on a new project if necessary 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.810
 like yes at times not enough projects 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.880
 because in reality really 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.040
 baby forgive so I carefully 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.750
 I read all the comments I do not miss 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.630
 hopefully not missing a single comment 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.810
 I read all the advice and all the reel up on a mustache 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.640
 which I don't have and try somehow 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.970
 mend being better much better 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.700
 even this counter which releases 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.519
 mcginnis he is like a trifle but without 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.650
 the martyr is more boring for him 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.690
 even a couple i create that i am so 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.450
 self-critical there I can be 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.160
 for example, she is . flew her not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.890
 noticed on it said books counter and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.310
 then is it like that but it is pure 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.109
 muzzle I hope attracts attention 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.390
 so that the person listened and understood where 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.980
 By the way, I bought about hope in this 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.380
 positions am not wrong so let me not 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.709
 I will talk about everything what a project is like 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.840
 this podcast is not specialized tom not 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.400
 did it because i want them i do 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.160
 it's because you want it so on then 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.640

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.530
 I really can't say nights 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.690
 really glad but because damn 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.260
 honestly the word when i started doing i 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.630
 even I decided to just try with me 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.390
 first video came cheats 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.160

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.870
 when 20 for 30 downloaded from me select 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.670
 what happiness was the dugout and frame later 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.460
 I started to invent music 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.930
 insert then I realized that you can 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.790
 bloody after a while 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.000
 quite a long time just music 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.710
 Salat need deliberately because this 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.330
 copyright therefore some videos 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.120
 from old tonsils because they 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.580
 blocked blocked by youtube that is 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.710
 not even blocked by the author's complaint 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.980
 on copyright we are in general porch 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.940

 watchable not as I confess 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.470
 I did before that moment when 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:25.070
 it was really too lazy to process the video I 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:27.680
 shot looked sound and comments go 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.880
 you had to really trim and just 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.460
 do this agree with the same me in the brain 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.170
 included what to do no more videos about 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.170
 as nothing to consider it 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.160
 regret i understood it just now i 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.790
