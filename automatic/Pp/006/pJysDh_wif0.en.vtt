inches<00:00:58.230> long<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.879> using<00:01:00.149> one-inch<00:01:00.930> thick

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
inches long and I'm using one-inch thick

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.450 
inches long and I'm using one-inch thick
ribbons<00:01:02.420> anything<00:01:03.559> anything<00:01:04.559> broader<00:01:05.190> than

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
then it really doesn't form into a ball

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.359 
then it really doesn't form into a ball
nicely<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.250> want<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:12.180> size

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
nicely so you want to get the right size

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.919 
nicely so you want to get the right size
now<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.429> way<00:01:14.789> I'm<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.179> to<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.300> arranging

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
now the way I'm going to be arranging

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.350 
now the way I'm going to be arranging
these<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.619> ribbon<00:01:17.039> swirls<00:01:17.429> on<00:01:17.819> the<00:01:18.119> ball

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
these little ribbon swirls on the ball

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
these little ribbon swirls on the ball
is<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:20.240> put<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.959> center<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.770> then

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
is to put one at the center and then

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.510 
is to put one at the center and then
make<00:01:23.910> all<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.649> circles<00:01:25.649> or<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
make all the other circles or all the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
make all the other circles or all the
others<00:01:26.789> whirls<00:01:27.149> around<00:01:27.539> it<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.619> alternating

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
others whirls around it in alternating

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.230 
others whirls around it in alternating
colors<00:01:29.819> this<00:01:30.660> way<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.929> will<00:01:31.410> make<00:01:31.649> sure<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
colors this way you will make sure that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.630 
colors this way you will make sure that
it's<00:01:33.240> following<00:01:33.569> a<00:01:34.050> kind<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.679> a<00:01:34.800> random<00:01:35.039> yet

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it's following a kind of a random yet

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.199 
it's following a kind of a random yet
organized<00:01:36.240> pattern<00:01:37.459> now<00:01:38.459> as<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.819> can<00:01:39.000> see

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
organized pattern now as you can see

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.020 
organized pattern now as you can see
there's<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.780> lot<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> cover<00:01:40.649> some<00:01:41.130> speeding<00:01:41.729> up

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
there's a lot to cover some speeding up

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.499 
there's a lot to cover some speeding up
this<00:01:42.239> video<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.700> we<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.910> get<00:01:45.119> through<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this video so we can get through it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.309 
this video so we can get through it
quickly<00:01:45.679> it's<00:01:46.679> really<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> same<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:48.319> one

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
quickly it's really the same thing one

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.070 
quickly it's really the same thing one
ribbon<00:01:49.800> swirl<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.280> center<00:01:51.080> alternating

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
ribbon swirl in the center alternating

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.169 
ribbon swirl in the center alternating
colors<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.679> ribbons<00:01:53.039> while<00:01:53.280> surrounding<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
colors of ribbons while surrounding it

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.870 
colors of ribbons while surrounding it
and<00:01:54.330> once<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.289> done<00:01:55.679> you<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.130> another<00:01:56.520> row

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and once that's done you do another row

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.680 
and once that's done you do another row
around<00:01:57.209> that<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.099> and<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.610> forth<00:01:59.970> until

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
around that and so on and so forth until

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.380 
around that and so on and so forth until
your<00:02:01.289> ribbon<00:02:01.619> ball<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.099> comes<00:02:02.429> slowly<00:02:02.910> getting

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
your ribbon ball is comes slowly getting

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.680 
your ribbon ball is comes slowly getting
covered<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:04.140> swirl<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.390> pretty

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
covered with swirl it's it's pretty

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.400 
covered with swirl it's it's pretty
straightforward

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
straightforward

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.240 
straightforward
a<00:02:07.649> circle<00:02:08.160> pin<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.420> moving<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.229> covering<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
a circle pin and moving on covering the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.140 
a circle pin and moving on covering the
entire<00:02:11.610> ball<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:13.980> takes<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:14.580> 15

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
entire ball it actually takes about 15

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.950 
entire ball it actually takes about 15
minutes

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
minutes

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.580 
minutes
20<00:02:16.350> minutes<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.770> complete<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.960> I'm<00:02:18.960> really

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
20 minutes to complete one so I'm really

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.920 
20 minutes to complete one so I'm really
condensing<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.280> into<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.930> six-and-a-half

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
condensing it into a six-and-a-half

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.890 
condensing it into a six-and-a-half
minute<00:02:22.530> video<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:24.330> doesn't<00:02:24.690> take<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
minute video but it doesn't take that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.440 
minute video but it doesn't take that
much<00:02:25.260> longer<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.090> want<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.300> make

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
much longer to do you just want to make

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
much longer to do you just want to make
sure<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.930> isn't<00:02:28.200> any<00:02:28.350> white<00:02:28.530> space<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.370> all

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
sure that isn't any white space and all

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.310 
sure that isn't any white space and all
the<00:02:29.850> little<00:02:30.120> pockets<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> wall<00:02:31.050> are

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
the little pockets of the wall are

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.000 
the little pockets of the wall are
completely<00:02:31.950> covered<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.410> I'm<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.800> was

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
completely covered so here I'm on was

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.090 
completely covered so here I'm on was
done<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.490> half<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.940> wall<00:02:36.150> I'm<00:02:36.450> gonna

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
done with half the wall I'm gonna

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.710 
done with half the wall I'm gonna
fast-forward<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> later<00:02:38.880> stage<00:02:39.240> where<00:02:39.570> I've

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
fast-forward to a later stage where I've

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.630 
fast-forward to a later stage where I've
got<00:02:39.990> now<00:02:40.260> about<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> third<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.940> ball<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.360> go

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
got now about a third of the ball to go

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.630 
got now about a third of the ball to go
again<00:02:44.640> I'm<00:02:44.910> following<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> same<00:02:45.630> principle

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
again I'm following the same principle

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.990 
again I'm following the same principle
just<00:02:47.640> covering<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.720> could<00:02:49.680> also<00:02:49.800> say<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.580> I'm

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
just covering I could also say that I'm

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.300 
just covering I could also say that I'm
you<00:02:51.510> know<00:02:51.630> doing<00:02:51.960> perpendicular<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.130> then

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you know doing perpendicular and then

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.920 
you know doing perpendicular and then
vertical<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.090> perpendicular<00:02:54.750> and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
vertical and perpendicular and

vertical and perpendicular and
vertically<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:56.160> way<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.180> really

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
vertically that way it's you know really

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.400 
vertically that way it's you know really
random<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.590> well<00:02:58.740> as<00:02:58.860> organized<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:01.140> I'm

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
random as well as organized and now I'm

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.610 
random as well as organized and now I'm
left<00:03:01.740> with<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> final<00:03:02.940> last<00:03:03.300> piece<00:03:03.810> another<00:03:04.350> two

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
left with a final last piece another two

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.720 
left with a final last piece another two
or<00:03:04.650> three<00:03:04.800> swirls<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.880> go<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.900> I'm<00:03:07.140> done<00:03:07.730> it's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
or three swirls to go and I'm done it's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.520 
or three swirls to go and I'm done it's
forming<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.360> nice<00:03:09.630> ball<00:03:10.080> shape<00:03:10.590> circular<00:03:11.400> round

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
forming a nice ball shape circular round

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.050 
forming a nice ball shape circular round
that's<00:03:13.530> really<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.160> primary<00:03:14.610> importance

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that's really of primary importance

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.550 
that's really of primary importance
because<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.330> doesn't<00:03:15.750> look<00:03:15.900> good<00:03:16.050> unless<00:03:16.260> it's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
because it doesn't look good unless it's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.000 
because it doesn't look good unless it's
a<00:03:16.650> nice<00:03:16.890> ball<00:03:18.260> okay<00:03:19.260> I'm<00:03:19.320> gonna<00:03:19.440> set<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:19.890> aside

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
a nice ball okay I'm gonna set it aside

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.640 
a nice ball okay I'm gonna set it aside
for<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.550> while<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.060> work<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.690> sticks<00:03:22.050> now

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
for a while and work on the sticks now

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.220 
for a while and work on the sticks now
you<00:03:22.710> can<00:03:23.130> use<00:03:23.400> craft<00:03:23.910> sticks<00:03:24.210> for<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:24.990> at

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
you can use craft sticks for this but at

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.890 
you can use craft sticks for this but at
the<00:03:25.320> moment<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.830> am<00:03:25.860> using<00:03:26.160> skewers<00:03:27.000> they<00:03:27.780> are

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the moment I am using skewers they are

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.320 
the moment I am using skewers they are
very<00:03:28.140> thin<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> need<00:03:29.310> about<00:03:29.400> four<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:29.970> them

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
very thin so I need about four of them

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.680 
very thin so I need about four of them
to<00:03:30.540> make<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> nice<00:03:31.130> broad<00:03:32.300> trunk<00:03:33.300> for<00:03:33.600> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
to make a nice broad trunk for the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.170 
to make a nice broad trunk for the
topiary<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.770> I'm<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.340> putting<00:03:35.580> some<00:03:35.970> glue

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
topiary and I'm just putting some glue

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.960 
topiary and I'm just putting some glue
from<00:03:37.020> my<00:03:37.230> glue<00:03:37.500> gun<00:03:37.530> onto<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.460> stick<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
from my glue gun onto the stick and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.210 
from my glue gun onto the stick and
gluing<00:03:39.360> them<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.660> together<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:40.980> they

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
gluing them all together so that they

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.540 
gluing them all together so that they
are<00:03:41.580> well<00:03:42.060> adhere<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.720> their<00:03:42.930> firmly<00:03:43.550> fit

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
are well adhere to their firmly fit

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.490 
are well adhere to their firmly fit
together<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.570> know<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.020> needs<00:03:46.290> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
together because you know this needs to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.610 
together because you know this needs to
be<00:03:46.620> sturdy<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.220> strong<00:03:47.780> then<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:49.050> just<00:03:49.350> gonna

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620

glue<00:03:53.040> into<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.550> hole<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.270> then<00:03:54.990> put<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
glue into that hole and then put the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.750 
glue into that hole and then put the
trunk<00:03:56.250> inside<00:03:57.200> while<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> leave<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:58.950> dry<00:03:59.190> I'm

life<00:05:01.080> I've<00:05:01.320> gotta<00:05:01.620> confess<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.730> just<00:05:03.660> keep

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
life I've gotta confess and I just keep

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.650 
life I've gotta confess and I just keep
making<00:05:04.170> bows<00:05:04.790> speaking<00:05:05.790> of<00:05:05.910> which<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.420> really

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
making bows speaking of which I really

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.360 
making bows speaking of which I really
don't<00:05:06.840> like<00:05:06.990> how<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.290> silver<00:05:07.620> one<00:05:07.860> is<00:05:07.890> looking

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
don't like how the silver one is looking

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.100 
don't like how the silver one is looking
against<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> gold<00:05:09.060> background<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:09.870> I'm<00:05:09.960> gonna

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
against the gold background so I'm gonna

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.980 
against the gold background so I'm gonna
just<00:05:10.380> take<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.800> off<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.640> replace<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.780> with<00:05:12.810> a

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
just take that off and replace it with a

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.040 
just take that off and replace it with a
nice<00:05:13.260> gold<00:05:13.710> bow<00:05:14.240> since<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.420> trunk<00:05:15.720> has<00:05:16.020> a

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
nice gold bow since the trunk has a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.320 
nice gold bow since the trunk has a
silver<00:05:16.470> bow<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.800> thought<00:05:17.160> let's<00:05:17.460> keep<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:17.940> gold

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
silver bow I thought let's keep it gold

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.840 
silver bow I thought let's keep it gold
for<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.750> base<00:05:20.120> it's<00:05:21.120> easy<00:05:21.360> enough<00:05:21.980> trim<00:05:22.980> glue

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
for the base it's easy enough trim glue

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.490 
for the base it's easy enough trim glue
and<00:05:24.470> my<00:05:25.470> topiary<00:05:26.010> is<00:05:26.130> almost<00:05:26.970> ready

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
as a final touch all I gotta do is now

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.730 
as a final touch all I gotta do is now
add<00:05:31.890> some<00:05:32.280> natural<00:05:33.000> elements<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.170> top<00:05:34.470> so

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
add some natural elements to the top so

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.330 
add some natural elements to the top so
where<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.040> doesn't<00:05:35.220> look<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:35.910> unnatural<00:05:37.340> if

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
where it doesn't look so unnatural if

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.860
