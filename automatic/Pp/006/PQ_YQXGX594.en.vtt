00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi girls in this video i want you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.060
 show the two products that it is 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.130
 using mostly below 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.160
 the umbrella this summer so be in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.080
 beach that the sea is to protect me 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 of the sun that you were treating your skin 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.420
 after sun exposure 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 so today I show you which are the lakes 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.570
 and sunscreen and my sun 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.430
 absolute favorites of this 2015 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
 in short, this summer 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 let's start immediately with the sunscreen 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 I'm using this sunscreen 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.590
 of the tea nature brand and a cream 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.440
 solar almo us and say that uses 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 only physical filters then the oxide 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 of titanium oxide informs 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.530
 micronized and therefore not 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.280
 uses summary protection factors 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.100
 but only vegetable and raw materials 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.210
 in fact minerals are also given to those who are 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 vegan 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.239
 inside there are 150 ml of product 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.220
 I bought this sunscreen 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.320
 on the site here is green dot it and ha 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.600
 paid 11 euros and 99 and sincerely 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.810
 I'm finding myself dean having why 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.970
 because it really spreads very well yes 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 absorbs immediately is not a cream 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.689
 a very light cream is also heavy 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.640
 which makes no white trail 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.439
 this is something I really like 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.220
 because it means that it really spreads 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.329
 in two seconds 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.729
 indeed almost like a monster like it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.869
 stretches then I take little is rather 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.409
 dense here it is spread in this 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.039
 so as you see I do n't do white 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.909
 and spreads immediately it really stretches 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.990
 in a few seconds among other things has a 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.439
 fragrance very good light perfume but of 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.890
 clear that in my opinion very very summer 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.599
 very good i really like it so much and i do 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.640
 I am finding very well because a 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:05.270
 Unlike most of the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.979
 I do n't do natural sunscreen 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.720
 white as I have shown here 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.989
 while most creams 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.959
 solar with physical filters so yes 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.180
 uses in that titanium studio 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.480
 instead it always does hate us anyway 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.069
 it is very difficult to stretch out afterwards 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 another thing I really like about 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.329
 this product is the others 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.250
 in fact there is rice oil 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.680
 walnut oil, carrot oil 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.319
 coconut oil which are perfect too 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.940
 for nutrients the hydration of the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.769
 body skin 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.840
 I think it went a bit to all types 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.930
 I haven't actually talked to you about it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.780
 of protection the protection is around 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.280
 around 20 then spf 20 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.829
 there is no inside the package 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.060
 written what is the protection but me 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.069
 I am informed and the company practically 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.040
 declares that it wanders around the 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.810
 protection 20 in short, then I like it 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.020
 so I applied it several times 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.780
 during the day 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.630
 among other things, I am bursting with perfumed la 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.710
 skin that is something that does not hurt 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.110
 however, a product that I recommend 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.690
 to try let me know who you are 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.820
 find if you have tried the after-sun 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.340
 instead he is using and always 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.670
 of the same brand then of tea 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.060
 nature milk after sun monoi clear the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.610
 with hypericum aloe rice bran ad 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.150
 soothing moisturizing action in fact goes to 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.790
 hydrate in my opinion for many hours 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.160
 the skin here the appeal I feel it 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.250
 also moisturize very fresh too 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.870
 thanks to the web that incites and true from 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.400
 however always a feeling of 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.040
 freshness 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.840
 in addition to moisturizing the skin in short 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.570
 together with the other ingredients 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.540
 among other things, very good consumption because it knows 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.550
 a bit of coconut a little vanilla and to me 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.250
 really really like it makes me right 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.410
 go crazy and show you too 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.240
 the application of this I put little 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.010
 on the arm 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.440
 among other things, as you see it is not as dense as 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.990
 the first one goes down a lot 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.360
 that date to put it on the skin 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.360
 as you can see it is not the slightest trace 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.360
 white is spread easily is absorbed 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.270
 really in a few seconds that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.859
 perfume I really like it both 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.020
 the scent has the feeling of 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.990
 freshness hydration on the skin 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.630
 which doesn't hurt after a day under 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.490
 the sun I also have this product 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.660
 purchased on the site here is green dot it 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.570
 and I paid 11 euros 99 and there are 150 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.030
 ml of product inside is fine 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.860
 even for people who are vegan 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.730
 in fact all the raw materials are 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.840
 vegetables and minerals as in the case of 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.940
 sunscreen 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.770
 last run too 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.720
 after sun I don't want to forget about 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.700
 tell me 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.850
 I string it all over my body then 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.550
 also on the face and after a shower 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.070
 lately I'm using it instead 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.780
 so just the face cream 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.550
 in short , I'm using it a little 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.220
 everywhere because it is still a cream 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.670
 light that is absorbed immediately and I do not 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.820
 I saw no pimples or pimples 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.190
 kind of reaction in short on my face and 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.840
 so I'm very happy continues to 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.030
 use it on my face during this time 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.910
 also because these products are them 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.830
 using for about a month and a half e 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.960
 always because anyway after only 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.840
 I use it even if I don't go to the beach 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.420
 or in the pool and why anyway with 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.490

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.690

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.730
