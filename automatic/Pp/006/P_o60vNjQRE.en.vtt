00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
applied to you to creating it and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.410 
applied to you to creating it and
Breitling<00:02:00.550> uses<00:02:00.940> what<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.750> solid<00:02:02.290> silver

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.600 
Breitling uses what is a solid silver
dial<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.720> then<00:02:04.960> they<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.070> technique

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
dial and then they do this technique

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.809 
dial and then they do this technique
which<00:02:06.909> which<00:02:07.300> really<00:02:07.709> creates<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:09.009> brilliant

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
which which really creates a brilliant

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
dip into the 40's and sometimes even

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.640 
dip into the 40's and sometimes even
below<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.910> I've<00:03:37.690> kind<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:38.049> gravitated

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
below that but I've kind of gravitated

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.849 
below that but I've kind of gravitated
away<00:03:39.010> from<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> larger<00:03:39.790> watches<00:03:40.650> recently<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
away from the larger watches recently I

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.810 
away from the larger watches recently I
don't<00:03:41.980> know<00:03:42.220> why<00:03:42.430> but<00:03:43.620> I've<00:03:44.620> taken<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.459> liking

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
don't know why but I've taken the liking

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.550 
don't know why but I've taken the liking

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
again to the smaller watches and I think

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.509 
again to the smaller watches and I think
this<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:47.890> looks<00:03:48.130> really<00:03:48.579> great<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.970> wrist
