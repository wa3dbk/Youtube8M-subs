00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 as soon as temperatures begin to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.400
 go back up from March 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.400
 you have to take out your pink laurels 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.000
 when we observe our oleanders 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.450
 after winter once he has stayed 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.910
 under a shelter if it was a shelter of 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.650
 garden frost-free of course the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.960
 temperature could go down between -5 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.070
 and this month if just support it 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.840
 there are some minor disadvantages 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.519
 since there are leaves that have been 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.429
 slightly damaged 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.119
 it's not a big deal though 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.760
 when comes the month of March 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.350
 it is absolutely necessary to cut or not 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.880
 carve his pink pillow because after he 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.990
 will be much too late so here we go 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.500
 to make just a small size of 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.070
 cleaning we will remove the twigs of 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.660
 last year some twig on 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.040
 the end for the master hour kids 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.860
 it's just a little bit of 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.290
 form then there we can see by 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.680
 example that these are buttons that 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.000
 did not flourish last year 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.560
 the reason is pretty simple it's a 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.040
 oleander that has been carved a small 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.200
 little late 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.570
 and like the oleander blossomed on the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.549
 wood of the year the buttons have arrived 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.950
 and did not flourish and a 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.659
 will blossom more this year either 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.710
 so it is urgent to carve them to 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.030
 from March 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.860
 even before the month of March we could have 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 detail already from the month of 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.550
 February 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.500
 now our oleanders it's 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.080
 a pretty greedy plant we're going 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.450
 feed it to feed well it's up to 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.640
 to say that in the pot we will bring him 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.659
 compost and for that we will already removed 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.450
 a little bit of the old earth and we 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:39.280
 will complete it with each other 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.710
 so just scratch on the surface because 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.720
 often over the years as 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.040
 potting the pole and pau was over 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.590
 in larger to the point it is difficult 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.270
 to change it for that we will remove from the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.920
 earth to the surface and we will replace it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.920
 by compost 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.220
 so the make up will allow to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.300
 feed our oleander because the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.460
 laurel-rose is a 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.870
 it's a Mediterranean plant that is 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.330
 quite greedy in the midday 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.330
 laurels rest henry 2 and outside 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.180
 once we have completed the scope of 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.550
 compost it will also bring him fertilizer 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.300
 from the moment he leaves again 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.360
 vegetation 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.820
 we're going to the rose a good shot knowing that we 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.020
 water at a time when it freezes port 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.030
 especially should not the rose is in 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.100
 a period of fasting and our laurels 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.100
 roses is exposed along a wall well 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.630
 exposed to the sun so that it 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.490
 recovers the heat of the day 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.200
 during the night and as soon as 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.330
 temperatures will actually go back to 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.680
 from April April but this 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.920
 moment there you push him back on 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.360
 outside if they kept freezing 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.610
 or if you have a temperature that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 goes below minus five degrees 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.140
 it is still more prudent to put 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.540
 a wintering veil from above for the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.220
 so protect your oleanders you 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 are sure to have two pretty flowers 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.150
 this year
