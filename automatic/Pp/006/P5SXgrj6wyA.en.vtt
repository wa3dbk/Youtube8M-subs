00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.359 
to represent um a gingerbread house um
so<00:00:17.369> hopefully<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> together<00:00:19.369> so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
so hopefully we can get it together so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.429 
so hopefully we can get it together so
let's<00:00:20.730> go<00:00:20.880> ahead<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.359> started<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:22.199> I'm

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
let's go ahead and get started first I'm

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.429 
let's go ahead and get started first I'm
going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> take<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> box<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:25.019> actually

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
going to take a box here and I actually

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to take a box here and I actually
think<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.369> great<00:00:26.849> color<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
think this is a great color for the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.240 
think this is a great color for the
house<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.760> might<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.449> even<00:00:30.480> color<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.410> but

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
house so I might not even color it but

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
house so I might not even color it but
I'll<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.090> use<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> good<00:00:33.600> size<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I'll just use the good size of it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.209 
I'll just use the good size of it

tip for you know like for the cake to
create<00:02:59.370> different<00:02:59.549> designs<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:01.290> think<00:03:01.590> I'm

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
create different designs on I think I'm

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.030 
create different designs on I think I'm
going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> use<00:03:02.609> this<00:03:02.849> one<00:03:03.030> over<00:03:03.269> here<00:03:04.040> it's

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
going to use this one over here it's

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:49.539 
going to use this one over here it's
very<00:03:05.250> generic<00:03:05.370> let's<00:03:06.120> use<00:03:06.299> them

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.070 

so<00:03:50.549> this<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.879> how<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.120> currently<00:03:51.360> looks<00:03:51.569> like

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
so this is how it currently looks like

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.770 
so this is how it currently looks like
and<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.680> guys<00:03:52.799> can<00:03:53.010> see<00:03:53.189> it<00:03:53.489> does<00:03:53.760> look<00:03:54.150> like<00:03:54.720> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
and you guys can see it does look like a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.850 
and you guys can see it does look like a
gingerbread<00:03:55.170> bed<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.900> does<00:03:58.110> take<00:03:58.319> a<00:03:58.349> while<00:03:58.590> for

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
gingerbread bed it does take a while for

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.140 
gingerbread bed it does take a while for
the<00:03:59.459> silicone<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.450> dry<00:04:01.819> roughly<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.970> outer

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150
