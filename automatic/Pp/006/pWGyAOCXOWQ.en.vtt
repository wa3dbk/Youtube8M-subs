I then racked two gallons of the
raspberry<00:02:23.150> brown<00:02:23.360> ale<00:02:23.540> into<00:02:23.810> my<00:02:23.900> keg<00:02:24.170> those

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
raspberry brown ale into my keg those

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.789 
raspberry brown ale into my keg those
number<00:02:26.080> measurements<00:02:27.080> are<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.440> handy

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
number measurements are really handy

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.580 
number measurements are really handy
with<00:02:28.180> getting<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.269> right<00:02:29.299> amount<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.930> beer

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
with getting the right amount of beer

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.280 
with getting the right amount of beer
into<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.920> keg<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.599> rest<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.080> sour

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
into the keg so the rest of the sour

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.759 
into the keg so the rest of the sour
brown<00:02:33.560> ale<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:34.150> racked<00:02:35.150> which<00:02:35.870> was<00:02:36.049> 2<00:02:36.230> gallons<00:02:36.590> I

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
brown ale I racked which was 2 gallons I

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.020 
brown ale I racked which was 2 gallons I
racked<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.750> into<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.470> raspberry<00:02:40.280> brown<00:02:40.640> ale

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
racked that into the raspberry brown ale

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.039 
racked that into the raspberry brown ale
fermenter<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.790> allow<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.450> sour<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:44.959> a

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
fermenter to allow that to sour for a

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.360 
fermenter to allow that to sour for a
little<00:02:45.290> bit<00:02:45.380> longer<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.920> those<00:02:46.519> raspberries

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
little bit longer on those raspberries

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
little bit longer on those raspberries
the<00:02:49.370> idea<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.060> let<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.329> Brett<00:02:50.569> break<00:02:51.470> down

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
the idea is to let the Brett break down

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.380 
the idea is to let the Brett break down
the<00:02:51.769> cellulose<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.400> raspberries<00:02:52.970> ferment

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the cellulose in the raspberries ferment

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.210 
the cellulose in the raspberries ferment
that<00:02:53.420> out<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:54.470> what<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> get<00:02:54.829> in<00:02:54.980> another

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that out and see what I get in another

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.930 
that out and see what I get in another
six<00:02:55.579> months<00:02:55.790> or<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.280> our<00:02:58.459> raspberry

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
six months or so so this our raspberry

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.030 
six months or so so this our raspberry
brown<00:02:59.239> ale<00:02:59.480> has<00:02:59.690> been<00:02:59.870> in<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.230> keg<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.829> about

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
brown ale has been in the keg for about

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.250 
brown ale has been in the keg for about
three<00:03:01.310> weeks<00:03:01.340> now<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.690> set<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.110> forget

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
three weeks now I do a set and forget

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.670 
three weeks now I do a set and forget
method<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.099> carbonating<00:03:04.879> at<00:03:05.120> about<00:03:05.720> 12<00:03:06.019> psi<00:03:06.290> or

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
method of carbonating at about 12 psi or

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.869 
method of carbonating at about 12 psi or
so<00:03:07.780> let's<00:03:08.780> see<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.340> sour<00:03:10.340> version<00:03:10.760> was

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
so let's see so the sour version was

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.699 
so let's see so the sour version was
brewed<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.329> late<00:03:11.540> November<00:03:12.139> so<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.560> about

pink slightly pink head on there big

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.680 
pink slightly pink head on there big
bubbles<00:04:04.880> head<00:04:05.569> dissipates<00:04:06.049> pretty<00:04:06.319> quickly

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
bubbles head dissipates pretty quickly

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.659 
bubbles head dissipates pretty quickly
I'm<00:04:08.690> using<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:09.230> glass<00:04:09.769> with<00:04:10.040> some<00:04:10.069> itching<00:04:10.549> in

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
I'm using a glass with some itching in

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.979 
I'm using a glass with some itching in
there<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> head<00:04:11.239> does<00:04:11.840> tend<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:14.540> form<00:04:14.930> a

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
there so the head does tend to to form a

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.080 
there so the head does tend to to form a
ring<00:04:15.200> around<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:15.890> glass<00:04:16.190> other<00:04:16.489> glasses<00:04:16.760> it

ring around this glass other glasses it

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.770 
ring around this glass other glasses it
just<00:04:17.539> dies<00:04:17.690> out<00:04:17.930> completely

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780

of<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.660> oak<00:04:36.840> that's<00:04:37.350> in<00:04:37.590> there<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:37.890> well<00:04:39.980> just

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
of the oak that's in there as well just

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.290 
of the oak that's in there as well just
a<00:04:41.190> light<00:04:41.910> hint<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.990> bulk<00:04:43.770> maybe<00:04:44.250> some<00:04:44.580> maybe

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
a light hint of a bulk maybe some maybe

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.810 
a light hint of a bulk maybe some maybe
a<00:04:45.450> little<00:04:45.630> bit<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.870> tannin<00:04:46.230> aroma<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:50.370> yeah

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
a little bit of tannin aroma but yeah

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:01.529 
a little bit of tannin aroma but yeah
mostly<00:04:52.160> raspberry<00:04:53.160> smells<00:04:53.910> really<00:04:54.030> good

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.430 

hmm

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
hmm

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.260 
hmm
turned<00:05:03.980> out<00:05:04.100> really<00:05:04.220> good<00:05:05.860> sour<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.070> tart<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
turned out really good sour and tart the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.850 
turned out really good sour and tart the
raspberry<00:05:08.720> flavor<00:05:08.960> is<00:05:09.140> very<00:05:09.260> balanced<00:05:09.770> in

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
raspberry flavor is very balanced in

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.590 
raspberry flavor is very balanced in
there<00:05:10.040> it's<00:05:10.160> not<00:05:10.310> over-the-top<00:05:10.640> raspberry

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
there it's not over-the-top raspberry

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.060 
there it's not over-the-top raspberry
it's<00:05:11.840> not<00:05:13.540> it's<00:05:14.540> not<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:15.590> don't<00:05:15.710> have<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.890> dig

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
it's not it's not you don't have to dig

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.300 
it's not it's not you don't have to dig
for<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:16.970> definitely<00:05:17.150> there<00:05:18.280> get<00:05:19.280> a

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
for it it's definitely there get a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.250 
for it it's definitely there get a
little<00:05:19.370> bit<00:05:19.730> of<00:05:19.880> malt<00:05:20.720> sweetness

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
little bit of malt sweetness

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.370 
little bit of malt sweetness
perhaps<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.860> perhaps<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:23.000> test<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.750> touch<00:05:24.080> of

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
perhaps a perhaps a test of a touch of

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.220 
perhaps a perhaps a test of a touch of
roastiness<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.580> there<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:27.440> raspberry<00:05:28.750> has<00:05:29.750> a

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
roastiness and there the raspberry has a

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.000 
roastiness and there the raspberry has a
an<00:05:30.800> esper<00:05:31.580> called<00:05:31.820> ethyl<00:05:32.330> formate<00:05:32.690> is<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.800> that

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
an esper called ethyl formate is it that

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.960 
an esper called ethyl formate is it that
almost<00:05:34.790> a<00:05:34.910> mommy<00:05:35.120> kind<00:05:35.420> of<00:05:36.280> flavor<00:05:37.280> that's<00:05:37.760> in

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
almost a mommy kind of flavor that's in

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.500 
almost a mommy kind of flavor that's in
there<00:05:38.240> as<00:05:38.480> well<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:40.130> would<00:05:40.910> say<00:05:41.150> it's<00:05:41.390> a

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
there as well I would say it's a

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:50.770 
there as well I would say it's a
moderately<00:05:42.200> sour<00:05:48.010> carbonation<00:05:49.240> is<00:05:50.240> perfect<00:05:50.690> I

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
moderately sour carbonation is perfect I

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.410 
moderately sour carbonation is perfect I
like<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:51.170> exactly<00:05:51.920> where<00:05:52.040> it's<00:05:52.160> at<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:52.610> was

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
like that exactly where it's at I was

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.410 
like that exactly where it's at I was
thinking<00:05:53.600> about<00:05:53.690> raising<00:05:54.050> it<00:05:54.110> up<00:05:54.230> but<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:55.550> carb

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
thinking about raising it up but a carb

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.240 
thinking about raising it up but a carb
carbonic<00:05:57.110> lights<00:05:57.320> just<00:05:57.530> about<00:05:57.650> perfect<00:05:58.070> for

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
carbonic lights just about perfect for

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.760 
carbonic lights just about perfect for
it<00:05:58.340> now<00:05:59.120> just<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.510> slight<00:05:59.840> bit<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.320> residual

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
it now just a slight bit of residual

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.210 
it now just a slight bit of residual
sweetness<00:06:00.980> it<00:06:01.400> hasn't<00:06:01.700> dried<00:06:01.880> out<00:06:02.090> completely

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
sweetness it hasn't dried out completely

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.060 
sweetness it hasn't dried out completely
it's<00:06:04.220> definitely<00:06:05.140> not<00:06:06.140> thin<00:06:06.530> there's

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
it's definitely not thin there's

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.940 
it's definitely not thin there's
definitely<00:06:07.790> some<00:06:08.150> body<00:06:08.330> to<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:08.720> not<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.590> whole

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
definitely some body to it not a whole

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.740 
definitely some body to it not a whole
lot<00:06:09.980> I'd<00:06:10.400> say<00:06:10.580> medium<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:10.970> light<00:06:11.120> body<00:06:16.660> so<00:06:17.660> I

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
lot I'd say medium the light body so I

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.060 
lot I'd say medium the light body so I
get<00:06:18.200> a<00:06:18.260> nice<00:06:19.120> nice<00:06:20.120> combination<00:06:20.720> of<00:06:20.840> sour<00:06:21.710> and

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
get a nice nice combination of sour and

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.460 
get a nice nice combination of sour and
raspberry<00:06:25.270> just<00:06:26.270> a<00:06:26.360> hint<00:06:26.630> of<00:06:26.840> caramel

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
raspberry just a hint of caramel

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.310 
raspberry just a hint of caramel
sweetness<00:06:27.920> in<00:06:28.310> there<00:06:30.550> yeah<00:06:31.550> really<00:06:31.850> good<00:06:32.060> beer

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
sweetness in there yeah really good beer

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.810 
sweetness in there yeah really good beer
it<00:06:33.320> turned<00:06:33.500> out<00:06:33.590> well<00:06:33.800> for<00:06:33.830> me<00:06:34.240> I<00:06:35.440> think<00:06:36.790> one<00:06:37.790> of

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
it turned out well for me I think one of

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.360 
it turned out well for me I think one of
the<00:06:37.940> tricks<00:06:38.210> was<00:06:38.920> was<00:06:39.920> putting<00:06:40.280> the

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
the tricks was was putting the

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.640 
the tricks was was putting the
raspberries<00:06:40.880> in<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:41.300> clean<00:06:41.540> beer<00:06:41.780> so<00:06:42.350> that

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
raspberries in the clean beer so that

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.900 
raspberries in the clean beer so that
the<00:06:42.950> raspberry<00:06:43.460> flavor<00:06:43.670> wasn't<00:06:43.940> completely

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
the raspberry flavor wasn't completely

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.630 
the raspberry flavor wasn't completely
consumed<00:06:46.910> by<00:06:47.150> the<00:06:47.210> Protandim<00:06:47.660> Isis

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
consumed by the Protandim Isis

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.540 
consumed by the Protandim Isis
it's<00:06:49.940> an<00:06:50.030> interesting<00:06:50.300> way<00:06:50.690> of<00:06:50.840> maybe<00:06:51.550> getting

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
it's an interesting way of maybe getting

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.190 
it's an interesting way of maybe getting
more<00:06:52.670> fruit<00:06:52.970> flavor<00:06:53.240> into<00:06:53.510> sour<00:06:53.690> beers<00:06:53.960> of

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
more fruit flavor into sour beers of

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.240 
more fruit flavor into sour beers of
course<00:06:54.380> then<00:06:54.590> you<00:06:54.710> have<00:06:54.740> to<00:06:55.130> either

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
course then you have to either

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.570 
course then you have to either
pasteurizer<00:06:55.790> crash<00:06:56.450> cool<00:06:56.840> it<00:06:56.990> like<00:06:57.140> I<00:06:57.290> did<00:06:57.580> if

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
pasteurizer crash cool it like I did if

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.720 
pasteurizer crash cool it like I did if
you<00:06:58.640> don't<00:06:58.910> do<00:06:59.090> that<00:06:59.270> then<00:07:00.280> the<00:07:01.280> protein<00:07:01.550> oh<00:07:01.580> my

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
you don't do that then the protein oh my

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.590 
you don't do that then the protein oh my
C's<00:07:02.000> and<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:03.800> stronger<00:07:04.250> bacterias<00:07:04.940> perhaps

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
C's and the stronger bacterias perhaps

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.310 
C's and the stronger bacterias perhaps
the<00:07:05.750> PDO<00:07:06.020> caucus<00:07:06.550> that's<00:07:07.550> going<00:07:07.880> to

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
the PDO caucus that's going to

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.380 
the PDO caucus that's going to
completely<00:07:09.320> thin<00:07:09.650> out<00:07:09.770> the<00:07:09.890> beer<00:07:10.070> and<00:07:10.190> just

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
completely thin out the beer and just

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.670 
completely thin out the beer and just
you're<00:07:11.390> not<00:07:11.570> gonna<00:07:11.660> have<00:07:11.780> any<00:07:11.990> sweetness<00:07:12.470> at

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
you're not gonna have any sweetness at

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.060 
you're not gonna have any sweetness at
all<00:07:13.040> left

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
all left

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.700 
all left
so<00:07:14.990> Cheers<00:07:16.080> and<00:07:16.290> thanks<00:07:17.190> for<00:07:17.280> watching<00:07:17.580> guys
