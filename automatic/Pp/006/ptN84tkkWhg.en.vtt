your<00:00:07.560> own<00:00:07.589> air<00:00:07.890> filter<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:09.090> actually<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> very

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
your own air filter it's actually a very

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.320 
your own air filter it's actually a very
simple<00:00:10.200> job<00:00:11.300> most<00:00:12.300> cars<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.580> air<00:00:14.580> filter<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
simple job most cars the air filter is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.730 
simple job most cars the air filter is
inside<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.160> these<00:00:17.369> plastic<00:00:17.730> boxes<00:00:18.740> either

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
inside one of these plastic boxes either

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.340 
inside one of these plastic boxes either
on<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.580> side<00:00:20.640> or<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.689> other<00:00:21.720> side<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
on this side or the other side of the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370 
on this side or the other side of the
car<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.510> usually<00:00:24.510> there's<00:00:24.689> some<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
car and usually there's some kind of a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.410 
car and usually there's some kind of a
hose<00:00:26.930> tubing<00:00:27.930> rubber<00:00:28.859> tubing<00:00:29.429> mechanism<00:00:30.029> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
hose tubing rubber tubing mechanism that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.020 
hose tubing rubber tubing mechanism that
goes<00:00:31.080> over<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> air<00:00:32.040> cleaner<00:00:32.369> over<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
goes over from the air cleaner over to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.130 
goes over from the air cleaner over to
the<00:00:33.210> fuel<00:00:33.630> injection<00:00:34.020> over<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> engine

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
the fuel injection over to the engine

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
the fuel injection over to the engine
these<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.320> fairly<00:00:37.559> easy<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.190> change

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
these are fairly easy to change

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.959 
these are fairly easy to change
they<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.960> clips<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:43.850> they're<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> little

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
they have clips that they're a little

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.110 
they have clips that they're a little
tight<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.710> released<00:00:47.090> with<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
tight but you can be released with a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.100 
tight but you can be released with a
little<00:00:48.390> pressure<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:50.039> don't<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:51.110> do

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
little pressure and you don't have to do

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.330 
little pressure and you don't have to do
like<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> old<00:00:52.469> cars<00:00:52.770> where<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> get

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
like the old cars where you have to get

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
like the old cars where you have to get
out<00:00:53.460> tools<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.180> wrenches<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.230> screwdrivers

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
out tools and wrenches and screwdrivers

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.119 
out tools and wrenches and screwdrivers
and<00:00:55.860> stuff<00:00:57.559> there's<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> back<00:00:59.100> here

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and stuff there's one in the back here

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.990 
and stuff there's one in the back here
to<00:00:59.550> holding<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:02.539> now<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.750> we're<00:01:03.899> gonna<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
to holding it now what we're gonna do is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
to holding it now what we're gonna do is
there's<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.270> tabs<00:01:06.810> back<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.520> hold

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
there's some tabs back here that hold

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
there's some tabs back here that hold
the<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.270> end<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.900> place<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.799> clips<00:01:11.130> hold

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the back end and in place the clips hold

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
the back end and in place the clips hold
the<00:01:11.490> front<00:01:11.729> end<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> place<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:13.409> gonna

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the front end in place so we're gonna

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.390 
the front end in place so we're gonna
lift<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.310> pull<00:01:14.820> back<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:16.799> release<00:01:17.009> those

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
lift up and pull back to release those

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.560 
lift up and pull back to release those
tabs<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> back<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.330> filter

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
tabs in the back so this is the filter

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
tabs in the back so this is the filter
and<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> filter<00:01:23.040> looks<00:01:23.369> like

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and this is what the filter looks like

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
and this is what the filter looks like
as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.439> pretty<00:01:25.619> dirty<00:01:27.110> let's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
as you can see it's pretty dirty let's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.340 
as you can see it's pretty dirty let's
go<00:01:28.229> ahead<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> change<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:32.869> we<00:01:33.869> bought<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> new

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
filter at the auto parts store comes in

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.370 
filter at the auto parts store comes in
a<00:01:39.570> box<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.400> there's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> bag<00:01:42.600> inside<00:01:43.079> that
