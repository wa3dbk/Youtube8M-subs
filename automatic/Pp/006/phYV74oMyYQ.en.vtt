okay<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:02.100> rover<00:00:02.700> 75<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.510> we're<00:00:04.290> going

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
okay this is a rover 75 and we're going

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.250 
okay this is a rover 75 and we're going
to<00:00:04.560> be<00:00:04.680> replacing<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.940> rear<00:00:06.690> brake<00:00:06.990> pads<00:00:09.260> okay

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
to be replacing the rear brake pads okay

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.549 
to be replacing the rear brake pads okay
first<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.590> all<00:00:10.679> we're<00:00:10.889> using<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.219> good<00:00:11.340> quality

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
first of all we're using a good quality

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.960 
first of all we're using a good quality
Jack<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:15.529> most<00:00:16.529> important<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
Jack and most important this has got a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.429 
Jack and most important this has got a
rubber<00:00:18.720> pad<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.980> prevent<00:00:20.310> any<00:00:20.550> damage<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.439> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
rubber pad to prevent any damage to the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.320 
rubber pad to prevent any damage to the
cell<00:00:23.000> we're<00:00:24.000> also<00:00:24.230> using<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.000> direct<00:00:27.000> jacking

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
cell we're also using the direct jacking

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:38.479 
cell we're also using the direct jacking
point<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:31.070> once<00:00:32.070> again<00:00:36.920> right<00:00:37.920> we've<00:00:38.190> removed

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
point so once again right we've removed

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
point so once again right we've removed
the<00:00:38.610> wheel<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> struggle

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the wheel which is a bit of a struggle

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.770 
the wheel which is a bit of a struggle
because<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.120> amount<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.300> corrosion<00:00:42.450> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
because of the amount of corrosion that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
because of the amount of corrosion that
built<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.320> between<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.980> aluminium<00:00:44.280> rim<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
built up between the aluminium rim and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
built up between the aluminium rim and
the<00:00:45.690> hub<00:00:45.989> itself<00:00:46.350> we'll<00:00:47.010> deal<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the hub itself we'll deal with this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.310 
the hub itself we'll deal with this
later<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> brake<00:00:49.260> caliper<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
later this is the brake caliper and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.310 
later this is the brake caliper and
brake<00:00:52.320> pads<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.739> quite<00:00:52.980> heavily<00:00:53.340> worn<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> we

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
brake pads are quite heavily worn so we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
brake pads are quite heavily worn so we
bout<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.399> strip<00:00:56.699> these<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.120> remove<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
bout to to strip these down remove the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.900 
bout to to strip these down remove the
caliper<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:59.250> expose<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> pads

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
caliper to expose the pads

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.090 
caliper to expose the pads
okay<00:01:02.910> we've<00:01:03.090> removed<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> brake<00:01:04.409> caliper<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
okay we've removed the brake caliper and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
okay we've removed the brake caliper and
it's<00:01:05.280> being<00:01:05.460> supported<00:01:05.810> by<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.869> bungee<00:01:07.470> cord

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it's being supported by this bungee cord

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.289 
it's being supported by this bungee cord
so<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.180> any<00:01:09.360> damage<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
so that we don't do any damage to the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.679 
so that we don't do any damage to the
hydraulic<00:01:12.299> hose<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.689> bike<00:01:13.820> hmm<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
hydraulic hose of the bike hmm as you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.130 
hydraulic hose of the bike hmm as you
can<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> brake<00:01:17.880> pad

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
can see on this this is the brake pad

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
can see on this this is the brake pad
that<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.799> seized<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:22.850> holder<00:01:23.850> it's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that is seized up in this holder it's

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
that is seized up in this holder it's
not<00:01:24.659> free<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> move<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> hence<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
not free to move and hence this is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
not free to move and hence this is
probably<00:01:28.049> why<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> brake<00:01:28.799> pads<00:01:29.070> failed

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
probably why that brake pads failed

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.469 
probably why that brake pads failed
prematurely<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:35.450> use<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
prematurely so we're going to use a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.749 
prematurely so we're going to use a
scraper<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.680> remove<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> corrosion

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
scraper and remove all the corrosion

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.679 
scraper and remove all the corrosion
from<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.530> hanger<00:01:40.860> itself<00:01:41.329> here<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.479> there

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
from the the hanger itself here in there

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
from the the hanger itself here in there
and<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:43.890> sure<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> pads<00:01:46.700> are<00:01:47.700> they

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and make sure that the pads are they

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
and make sure that the pads are they
fitted<00:01:48.270> we'll<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> pre<00:01:49.170> assembly<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
fitted we'll do a pre assembly just to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
fitted we'll do a pre assembly just to
make<00:01:50.040> sure<00:01:50.070> they're<00:01:50.579> free<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.000> move<00:01:51.380> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
make sure they're free to move and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.770 
make sure they're free to move and
there's<00:01:52.560> no<00:01:52.740> corrosion<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> cause

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there's no corrosion is going to cause

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.540 
there's no corrosion is going to cause
them<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> seize<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.380> again

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.700 

okay<00:02:01.550> we've<00:02:01.760> we've<00:02:02.360> removed<00:02:03.260> all<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
okay we've we've removed all the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.080 
okay we've we've removed all the

been fitted on assemble properly you can
see<00:02:57.860> there's<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.130> small<00:02:58.660> very<00:02:59.660> small<00:02:59.750> amount<00:03:00.230> of

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
see there's a small very small amount of

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.410 
see there's a small very small amount of
copper<00:03:00.530> grease<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:03.970> contact<00:03:04.970> areas

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420

great<00:03:06.380> putt<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.280> we've<00:03:07.489> also<00:03:07.900> descaled

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
great putt and we've also descaled

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.930 
great putt and we've also descaled
removed<00:03:09.739> all<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:09.950> rust<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.400> one<00:03:13.670> before

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
removed all the rust so that one before

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.440 
removed all the rust so that one before
the<00:03:14.060> alloy<00:03:14.320> will<00:03:15.320> be<00:03:15.410> no<00:03:16.090> further<00:03:17.090> corrosion

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the alloy will be no further corrosion

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:28.479 
the alloy will be no further corrosion
going<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:18.380> between<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.920> alloy<00:03:27.280> okay<00:03:28.280> that's

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
going on between the alloy okay that's

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.640 
going on between the alloy okay that's
everything<00:03:29.120> back<00:03:29.390> together<00:03:29.540> again<00:03:29.780> we've

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
everything back together again we've

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.500 
everything back together again we've
pumped<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.040> brakes<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.940> make<00:03:32.060> sure<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
pumped the brakes to make sure the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.500 
pumped the brakes to make sure the
pedals<00:03:32.920> at<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.100> top<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.550> is<00:03:35.739> firm<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:38.150> final

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
pedals at the top and is firm the final

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.850 
pedals at the top and is firm the final
thing<00:03:38.690> we<00:03:38.810> have<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.110> do<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.380> make<00:03:39.560> sure<00:03:39.590> that

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
thing we have to do is make sure that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.850 
thing we have to do is make sure that
the<00:03:39.950> wheel<00:03:40.100> notes<00:03:40.340> are<00:03:40.519> not<00:03:40.930> too<00:03:41.930> slack<00:03:42.170> or<00:03:42.560> too

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the wheel notes are not too slack or too

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.970 
the wheel notes are not too slack or too
tight<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:44.140> like<00:03:45.140> obviously<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.800> wheel

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
tight just like obviously the wheel

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.710 
tight just like obviously the wheel
would<00:03:46.580> fall<00:03:47.300> off<00:03:47.330> too<00:03:48.260> tight<00:03:48.590> means<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.790> you

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
would fall off too tight means that you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.479 
would fall off too tight means that you
wouldn't<00:03:50.959> be<00:03:51.019> able<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.260> remove<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.340> wheel

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
wouldn't be able to remove the the wheel

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.740 
wouldn't be able to remove the the wheel
nuts<00:03:52.810> with<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.850> little<00:03:55.850> wheel<00:03:56.000> braces<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.630> the

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
nuts with the little wheel braces in the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.580 
nuts with the little wheel braces in the
boot<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.769> way<00:03:57.890> we<00:03:58.040> do<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.430> by<00:03:58.730> using<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
boot the way we do that is by using a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.199 
boot the way we do that is by using a
torque<00:04:00.590> wrench<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.549> will<00:04:01.730> make<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.910> a

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
torque wrench so this will make a a

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.240 
torque wrench so this will make a a
blinking<00:04:05.209> noise

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
blinking noise

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.310 
blinking noise
