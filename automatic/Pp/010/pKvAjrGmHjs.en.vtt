00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
and now that I've graduated I figured

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.789 
and now that I've graduated I figured
it's<00:00:12.030> time<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.330> take<00:00:12.509> some<00:00:12.690> more<00:00:12.840> off<00:00:12.990> decided

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
it's time to take some more off decided

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.440

to<00:00:13.889> cut<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.190> hair<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.549> cutting<00:00:15.120> hair<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
to cut my hair because cutting hair is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
to cut my hair because cutting hair is
very<00:00:15.570> healthy<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.170> hair<00:00:16.500> especially<00:00:16.980> getting

wanted to link the end I'm wetting the
first<00:03:15.850> section

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
first section

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.390 
first section
of<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.180> top<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.720> head<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.310> I'm

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
going to cut so combing it all the way

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.590 
going to cut so combing it all the way
up<00:03:22.620> making<00:03:23.160> sure<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.550> nice<00:03:23.790> even<00:03:24.090> cut

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
up making sure I have a nice even cut

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.720 
up making sure I have a nice even cut
Coe<00:03:25.410> me<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:25.680> those<00:03:25.800> fingers<00:03:26.190> over<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.670> over

Coe me with those fingers over and over

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.490 
Coe me with those fingers over and over
again<00:03:26.940> probably<00:03:27.360> did<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.600> about<00:03:27.930> six<00:03:28.200> seven

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
again probably did that about six seven

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.940 
again probably did that about six seven
times<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:30.570> also<00:03:30.750> need<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.110> turn<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.710> side

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
times you also need to turn to the side

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.650 
times you also need to turn to the side
to<00:03:32.310> make<00:03:32.340> sure<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:33.000> you're<00:03:33.030> not<00:03:33.270> tilting

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
to make sure that you're not tilting

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.240 
to make sure that you're not tilting
forward<00:03:33.930> or<00:03:34.230> back<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.680> keep<00:03:37.950> combing

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
forward or back so I keep combing

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.420 
forward or back so I keep combing
straight<00:03:38.820> up<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.120> my<00:03:39.270> head<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.950> only<00:03:41.220> reason

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
straight up on my head the only reason

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
straight up on my head the only reason
this<00:03:41.820> even<00:03:42.180> works<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.630> because<00:03:42.780> you're

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
this even works is because you're

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.140 
this even works is because you're
securing<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.220> making<00:03:44.520> sure<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
securing it and making sure that the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.650

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
hair is all combed out and even after

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.720 
hair is all combed out and even after
that<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.230> brought<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.800> front<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.580> use

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that I brought it to the front and I use

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.430 
that I brought it to the front and I use
my<00:03:50.850> fingers<00:03:51.210> as<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> guide<00:03:51.660> for<00:03:51.900> each<00:03:52.050> section

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.170 

again<00:03:55.440> cutting<00:03:55.770> an<00:03:55.920> even<00:03:56.220> line<00:03:56.400> across<00:03:56.790> each

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
again cutting an even line across each

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.390 
again cutting an even line across each
section<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:58.230> not<00:03:58.470> cut<00:03:58.800> sections<00:03:59.250> together

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
section do not cut sections together

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.060 
section do not cut sections together
this<00:03:59.820> is<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.270> bad<00:04:00.540> make<00:04:01.290> sure<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.530> do<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:01.860> at<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.220 
hair is easily pulled away from my head
I<00:04:46.790> did<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:47.910> quite<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.210> few<00:04:48.330> times<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.930> is<00:04:49.110> the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
I did this quite a few times this is the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.080 
I did this quite a few times this is the
most<00:04:49.410> important<00:04:49.950> step<00:04:50.280> before<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.850> cut

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
most important step before you cut

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.630 
most important step before you cut
anything<00:04:51.420> is<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.810> make<00:04:52.110> sure<00:04:52.290> that<00:04:52.590> it's<00:04:53.460> an

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
anything is to make sure that it's an

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.130 
anything is to make sure that it's an
even<00:04:53.880> distance<00:04:54.240> from<00:04:54.420> your<00:04:54.510> head<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.870> also

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
even distance from your head and also

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.510 
even distance from your head and also
turn<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.590> side<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.010> make<00:04:56.160> sure<00:04:56.190> you're

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
turn to the side and make sure you're

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
turn to the side and make sure you're
not<00:04:56.640> favoring<00:04:57.270> forward<00:04:58.170> or<00:04:58.290> back<00:04:58.500> any<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.580> I'm

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
not favoring forward or back any and I'm

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.970 
not favoring forward or back any and I'm
securing<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.110> with<00:05:01.260> my<00:05:01.410> rubber<00:05:01.590> band<00:05:03.980> don't

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
securing that with my rubber band don't

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.590 
securing that with my rubber band don't
pull<00:05:05.160> too<00:05:05.190> tight<00:05:05.370> because<00:05:05.700> it's<00:05:05.970> part<00:05:06.180> kind<00:05:06.510> of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
pull too tight because it's part kind of

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.830 
pull too tight because it's part kind of
hurt<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.650> don't<00:05:08.190> need<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.580> pull<00:05:09.420> out<00:05:09.450> your

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
hurt so you don't need to pull out your

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.910 
to bottom holding that in my hand see
how<00:05:21.030> I'm<00:05:21.150> flattening<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:22.050> shouldn't<00:05:22.830> have

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
how I'm flattening it I shouldn't have

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.710 
how I'm flattening it I shouldn't have
done<00:05:22.980> that<00:05:23.190> because<00:05:23.700> then<00:05:23.940> I'm<00:05:24.090> making<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.570> an

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
done that because then I'm making it an

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.600 
done that because then I'm making it an
up-and-down<00:05:25.410> plane<00:05:27.830> instead<00:05:28.830> of<00:05:29.100> a<00:05:29.190> forward

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
up-and-down plane instead of a forward

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.370 
up-and-down plane instead of a forward
and<00:05:29.729> back<00:05:29.910> plane

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
and back plane

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.360 
and back plane
I<00:05:30.710> was<00:05:31.430> very<00:05:31.640> careful<00:05:31.910> with<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.510> but<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:33.310> kind<00:05:34.310> of

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
I was very careful with it but I kind of

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.080 
I was very careful with it but I kind of
put<00:05:34.550> my<00:05:34.670> hair<00:05:34.850> out<00:05:34.880> of<00:05:35.030> order<00:05:37.090> smaller

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
put my hair out of order smaller

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.570 
put my hair out of order smaller
