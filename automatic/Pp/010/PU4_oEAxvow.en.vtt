00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.399
 everyone should know 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.219
 in this video that you were introduced to the ball did not arise today 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.619
 Europeans are bicycles with about one at the front of the bicycle 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.289
 wheelchair is mounted 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.460
 the co-driver 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 the front part of the divisible variant is easy to disconnect 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.149
 of the bicycle part so that you can use this part on location as a wheelchair 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.570

 However, a wheelchair has no brake bearings and other stability to the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.680
 be able to travel at higher speeds 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 so it is not safe to attach a bicycle that was smiling here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.340
 with the open air a safe solution has been created to participate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.520

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.320
 The frame is optional part in which the construction is kept compact as a result 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 the bicycle can also be used for private use 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.890
