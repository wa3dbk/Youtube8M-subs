before<00:00:07.710> not<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.250> website<00:00:08.790> refugees<00:00:09.540> we're

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
before not to my website refugees we're

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.690 
before not to my website refugees we're
not<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.020> life<00:00:12.170> is<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.950> feed<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> starter

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
not in life is about to feed the starter

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.039 
not in life is about to feed the starter
so<00:00:14.880> I'm<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.120> measuring<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:15.929> much

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so I'm just measuring about how much

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.960 
so I'm just measuring about how much
starter<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> started<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.700> this<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
starter I started out with so this is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.609 
starter I started out with so this is
about<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.180> half<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> cup<00:00:18.540> actually<00:00:19.050> wet<00:00:19.230> Mike<00:00:19.439> up

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
about a half a cup actually wet Mike up

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
about a half a cup actually wet Mike up
a<00:00:19.740> little<00:00:19.980> bit<00:00:20.099> just<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.609> makes<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
a little bit just because it makes it

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.939 
a little bit just because it makes it
easier<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> come<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.650> i<00:00:22.770> was

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
easier to come out so then i was

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.320 
easier to come out so then i was
probably<00:00:23.010> two-thirds<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> cup<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:24.150> half<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
probably two-thirds of a cup or half a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.550 
probably two-thirds of a cup or half a
cup<00:00:24.859> I'm<00:00:25.859> never<00:00:26.490> exact<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:28.410> can

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
cup I'm never exact about this we can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
cup I'm never exact about this we can
tell<00:00:30.650> that's<00:00:31.650> why<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> baker<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.000> had

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
tell that's why I'm not a baker so I had

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.689 
tell that's why I'm not a baker so I had
a<00:00:33.239> quarter<00:00:33.660> cup<00:00:33.809> yesterday<00:00:34.050> huh<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.280> that

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
a quarter cup yesterday huh and so that

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.580 
a quarter cup yesterday huh and so that
your<00:00:35.850> starter<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.420> feed<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.020> flowers<00:00:37.440> so

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
your starter you feed it with flowers so

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.260 
your starter you feed it with flowers so
basically<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> yeast<00:00:38.880> in<00:00:39.059> here

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
basically it's going the yeast in here

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.700 
basically it's going the yeast in here
is<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> eat<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:39.870> sugar<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> flour

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
is going to eat the sugar and the flour

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.069 
is going to eat the sugar and the flour
in<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.360> feed<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.629> basically

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
in there so when you feed it basically

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
in there so when you feed it basically
you're<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.350> adding<00:00:44.120> you're<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.360> adding

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you're just adding you're just adding

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.840 
you're just adding you're just adding
flour<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> want<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
flour to it and then you want this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
flour to it and then you want this
consistency<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> happy<00:00:49.289> pancake

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
consistency this kind of happy pancake

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.190 
consistency this kind of happy pancake
batter<00:00:50.010> okay<00:00:50.550> hi<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.480> could<00:00:51.660> make<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> thicker

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
batter okay hi you could make it thicker

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.470 
batter okay hi you could make it thicker
too<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.520> want<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:53.969> thicker<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
too so if you want to make thicker you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
too so if you want to make thicker you
can<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:54.870> add<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.680> could<00:00:55.860> add<00:00:56.039> more

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
can actually add you could add more

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.220 
can actually add you could add more
flour<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> at

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
flour if you want but you have to at

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.900 
flour if you want but you have to at
least<00:00:58.320> double<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> add<00:00:59.250> too<00:00:59.460> little

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
least double it if you add too little

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
least double it if you add too little
it's<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.449> enough<00:01:00.600> food<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it's not going to be enough food so the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
it's not going to be enough food so the
very<00:01:01.829> least<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.280> doubling<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.359> can

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
very least is doubling it but you can

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.880 
very least is doubling it but you can
actually<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.199> three<00:01:04.410> times<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
actually like the three times in a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.050 
actually like the three times in a
flower<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.520> gonna<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.789> a<00:01:05.850> much

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
flower and you're gonna get a much

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
flower and you're gonna get a much
thicker<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> always<00:01:07.800> added<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> same

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thicker so I always added about the same

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.480 
thicker so I always added about the same
amount<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.180> water<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> my

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
amount of water because I want one of my

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.359 
amount of water because I want one of my
dancin<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> can't<00:01:13.140> add<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> amount<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
dancin is so you can't add the amount of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.280 
dancin is so you can't add the amount of
water<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.030> added<00:01:15.240> yes<00:01:15.540> by<00:01:15.750> volume<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
water that you added yes by volume is

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
water that you added yes by volume is
goes<00:01:16.560> away<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.670> volume<00:01:18.140> equal

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
goes away but I do about my volume equal

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.160 
goes away but I do about my volume equal

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
parts water and flour 2 equals to the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.539 
parts water and flour 2 equals to the
volume<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.130> trip<00:01:23.340> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
starter but usually all dated cuz i

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.870 
starter but usually all dated cuz i
usually<00:02:04.290> won't<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.770> might<00:02:05.160> not<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
usually won't I might not use this for a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.370 
usually won't I might not use this for a
month<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.330> want<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.690> at<00:02:06.810> least<00:02:06.870> keep<00:02:07.140> track

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
month so I want to at least keep track

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.200 
month so I want to at least keep track
with<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> fed<00:02:08.040> it<00:02:08.070> last<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.880> what<00:02:09.000> I'll<00:02:09.090> do

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
with when I fed it last so what I'll do

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.330 
with when I fed it last so what I'll do
is<00:02:09.240> actually<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.229> level<00:02:10.649> so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
is actually put it on at the level so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.560 
is actually put it on at the level so
this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.640> actually<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.910> good<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.450> if

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
this is actually a good way to see if

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.500 
this is actually a good way to see if
your<00:02:12.720> starters<00:02:13.200> active<00:02:13.700> I'm<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.390> know

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
your starters active I'm you know

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.730 
your starters active I'm you know
positive<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:15.990> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.230> active<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.620> I've

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
positive is going to be active as I've

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.320 
positive is going to be active as I've
been<00:02:16.890> using<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.490> last<00:02:17.640> couple<00:02:17.820> days<00:02:18.090> but

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
been using it the last couple days but

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.210 
been using it the last couple days but
if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.570> put<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.840> here<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.560> you'll<00:02:19.709> notice<00:02:19.770> is

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
if you put it here what you'll notice is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.730 
if you put it here what you'll notice is
that<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.959> lift<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> counter

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
that if I lift it out on the counter

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.130 
that if I lift it out on the counter
after<00:02:23.130> about<00:02:23.400> six<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.910> seven<00:02:24.090> hours<00:02:24.390> at<00:02:24.810> about

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
after about six or seven hours at about

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.870 
after about six or seven hours at about
this<00:02:25.320> heat<00:02:25.560> will<00:02:25.740> double<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.280> size<00:02:26.310> at<00:02:26.700> least

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
this heat will double in size at least

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.030 
this heat will double in size at least
we'll<00:02:27.060> come<00:02:27.270> out<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.570> if<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.680> put<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
we'll come out to here if I put in the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.070 
we'll come out to here if I put in the
fridge<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.310> might<00:02:29.550> take<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> couple<00:02:29.850> days<00:02:30.150> but

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
fridge and might take a couple days but

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.900 
fridge and might take a couple days but
that's<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.590> good<00:02:31.740> way<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.100> kind<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.730> able

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that's a good way that kind of be able

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.970 
that's a good way that kind of be able
to<00:02:32.970> visually<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:33.930> retarded<00:02:34.380> boy<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
to visually see if retarded boy the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.699 
to visually see if retarded boy the
other<00:02:35.100> way<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.610> you're<00:02:35.970> opening<00:02:36.300> up

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
other way is like you're opening up

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.740 
other way is like you're opening up
you're<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> lot<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:38.750> I'm

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you're going to see a lot of here I'm

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.940 
you're going to see a lot of here I'm
the<00:02:39.870> thing<00:02:40.050> that's<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.350> happen<00:02:40.410> when

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the thing that's going to happen when

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.440 
the thing that's going to happen when
you<00:02:41.100> let<00:02:41.250> your<00:02:41.310> startup<00:02:41.940> stick<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
you let your startup stick and it

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.820 
you let your startup stick and it
basically<00:02:42.600> comes<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.350> you're<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.740> get

this stuff on top of it is busy to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.490 
this stuff on top of it is busy to
separate<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.989> it's<00:02:46.110> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.440> a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
separate and it's going to be like a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.620 
separate and it's going to be like a
liquid<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.519> top<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.850> really<00:02:48.120> smells<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.480> a
