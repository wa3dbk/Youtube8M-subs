basically<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.030> comes<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.049> this

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
basically it comes in a thing like this

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.679 
basically it comes in a thing like this
and<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.610> two<00:01:08.939> trays<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and these are the little two trays and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.649 
and these are the little two trays and
then<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.890> four<00:01:11.189> fillings<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.240> it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
actually I really like this one mostly

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.310 
actually I really like this one mostly
because<00:03:24.330> my<00:03:24.600> teeth<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.840> really<00:03:24.930> sensitive

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
because my teeth are really sensitive

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.450 
because my teeth are really sensitive
and<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.650> didn't<00:03:25.920> hurt<00:03:26.150> whatsoever<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.460> it's

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
and it didn't hurt whatsoever and it's

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.120 
and it didn't hurt whatsoever and it's
pretty<00:03:29.730> easy<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.680> thing<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.890> didn't

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
pretty easy but the one thing I didn't

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.830 
pretty easy but the one thing I didn't
like<00:03:32.160> about<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.520> is<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.180> tray<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.630> just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
like about it is that the tray is just

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.030 
like about it is that the tray is just
really<00:03:34.080> annoying<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.560> keep<00:03:34.710> in<00:03:34.830> your<00:03:34.920> mouth

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
really annoying to keep in your mouth

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.990 
really annoying to keep in your mouth
for<00:03:35.280> two<00:03:35.400> hours<00:03:36.320> but<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.470> worth<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.740> guess<00:03:38.010> so

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
for two hours but so worth it I guess so

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000 
for two hours but so worth it I guess so
that's<00:03:39.390> how<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.140> get<00:03:40.290> these<00:03:40.470> pearly<00:03:40.860> white

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
