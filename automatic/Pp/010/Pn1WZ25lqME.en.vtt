the copper two-inch and test and the
caps<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.690> insulators<00:04:00.200> in<00:04:00.320> between<00:04:00.650> them

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
caps and the insulators in between them

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.210 
caps and the insulators in between them
are<00:04:01.100> these<00:04:02.320> nylon<00:04:04.150> 1/2<00:04:05.150> or<00:04:05.600> 1/2<00:04:05.930> inch<00:04:06.320> wall

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
are these nylon 1/2 or 1/2 inch wall

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.280 
are these nylon 1/2 or 1/2 inch wall
washers<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.330> there's<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.600> bolt<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:08.870> between

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
washers and there's a bolt in between

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.290 
washers and there's a bolt in between
that<00:04:09.380> holding<00:04:09.680> together<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.970> then<00:04:11.060> let<00:04:11.180> me

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
that holding together and then let me

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.720 
that holding together and then let me
rotate<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:13.990> I<00:04:15.070> got<00:04:16.070> those<00:04:16.220> soldered<00:04:16.580> together

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
rotate it I got those soldered together

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.050 
rotate it I got those soldered together
and<00:04:17.540> then<00:04:18.200> for<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.100> rotator<00:04:19.520> mechanism<00:04:22.060> it's

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
and then for the rotator mechanism it's

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.080 
and then for the rotator mechanism it's
got<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> 2<00:04:23.480> RPM<00:04:23.900> gear<00:04:24.290> motor<00:04:24.640> he<00:04:25.640> said<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.000> was

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
got a 2 RPM gear motor he said it was

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.730 
got a 2 RPM gear motor he said it was
high<00:04:26.240> crook<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.630> ordered<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:27.470> it's<00:04:27.590> not

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
high crook and I ordered it but it's not

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.000 
high crook and I ordered it but it's not
generally<00:04:28.670> mad<00:04:28.820> about<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.810> spend<00:04:30.020> $25

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
generally mad about that just spend $25

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.380 
generally mad about that just spend $25
for<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.760> doesn't<00:04:32.060> probably<00:04:32.180> work<00:04:34.390> and

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
for it and it doesn't probably work and

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.560 
for it and it doesn't probably work and
then<00:04:36.260> let's<00:04:36.530> see<00:04:36.710> oh<00:04:36.890> here's<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:38.030> wires<00:04:38.240> up

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
then let's see oh here's the wires up

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.260 
then let's see oh here's the wires up
here

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.040 

you<00:04:42.870> can<00:04:43.050> see<00:04:44.090> bottom<00:04:45.090> one<00:04:45.240> goes<00:04:45.450> soldered

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
you can see bottom one goes soldered

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.020 
you can see bottom one goes soldered
there<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.470> have<00:04:46.590> your<00:04:46.710> drill<00:04:46.890> every<00:04:47.700> time<00:04:48.000> I

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
there and I have your drill every time I

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.730 
there and I have your drill every time I
go<00:04:48.240> up<00:04:48.270> your<00:04:48.480> next<00:04:48.660> one<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.990> top<00:04:49.170> one<00:04:49.200> has<00:04:49.500> four

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
go up your next one the top one has four

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.220 
go up your next one the top one has four
holes<00:04:49.950> at<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.190> top<00:04:50.220> for<00:04:50.970> all<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.810> three<00:04:51.990> wires

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
holes at the top for all the three wires

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.070 
holes at the top for all the three wires
including<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.920> ones<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.460> collect<00:04:53.610> during

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
including the ones that collect during

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.320 
including the ones that collect during
and<00:04:55.080> then<00:04:55.200> right<00:04:55.410> here<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:56.640> this<00:04:56.820> little<00:04:57.090> part

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
and then right here is this little part

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.920 
and then right here is this little part
which<00:04:57.510> is<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.690> little<00:04:58.280> thingy<00:04:59.280> like<00:04:59.630> a<00:05:00.630> motor

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
which is a little thingy like a motor

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.400 
which is a little thingy like a motor
shaft<00:05:01.290> length<00:05:02.240> made<00:05:03.240> using<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.990> screw<00:05:04.290> and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
shaft length made using a screw and

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.500 
shaft length made using a screw and
dowel<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.700> remove<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.090> camera<00:05:06.420> off<00:05:06.480> the

dowel and remove the camera off the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.020 
dowel and remove the camera off the
tripod<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.400> rotate<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:08.520> around<00:05:08.640> one<00:05:09.000> more

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
tripod and rotate it around one more

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.910 
tripod and rotate it around one more
time<00:05:11.900> put<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.140> my<00:05:13.260> round<00:05:13.470> there<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:16.740> see

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
time put it to my round there you see

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.090 
time put it to my round there you see
there's<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.250> screw<00:05:17.730> in<00:05:17.880> there

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.030 

which<00:05:21.670> the<00:05:22.630> motor<00:05:22.780> is<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.020> flat<00:05:23.320> shaft<00:05:23.680> on

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
which the motor is a flat shaft on

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.940 
which the motor is a flat shaft on
behalf<00:05:24.730> of<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:24.970> side<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.140> have<00:05:26.230> that<00:05:26.590> scoot

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
behalf of the side so I have that scoot

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.360 
behalf of the side so I have that scoot
on<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.280> end<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.520> there<00:05:27.900> until<00:05:28.900> not<00:05:29.830> glued<00:05:30.160> and

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
on the end to there until not glued and

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.710 
on the end to there until not glued and
music<00:05:30.640> friction<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.150> it's<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.390> there<00:05:31.540> really

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
music friction so it's in there really

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.250 
music friction so it's in there really
well

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
well

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.130 
well
and<00:05:33.100> then<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.460> bolt<00:05:33.670> is<00:05:34.360> glued<00:05:34.660> you<00:05:34.900> can't

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
and then the bolt is glued you can't

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.780 
and then the bolt is glued you can't
hardly<00:05:35.350> see<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:35.830> really<00:05:36.070> blurry<00:05:36.340> so

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
hardly see that it's really blurry so

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.170 
hardly see that it's really blurry so
there's<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:40.240> bolts<00:05:40.540> glued<00:05:40.750> into<00:05:40.960> there<00:05:42.180> and

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
there's the bolts glued into there and

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.370 
there's the bolts glued into there and
then<00:05:43.300> I<00:05:43.360> got<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:44.190> 3/4<00:05:45.190> PVC<00:05:45.400> cap<00:05:45.960> bolted<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.140> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
then I got a 3/4 PVC cap bolted to the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.370 
then I got a 3/4 PVC cap bolted to the
collector<00:05:47.920> is<00:05:48.100> a<00:05:48.250> rotator<00:05:48.840> measure<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.230> then

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
collector is a rotator measure and then

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.250 
collector is a rotator measure and then
3/4<00:05:51.010> PVC<00:05:51.190> in<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.700> milk<00:05:51.940> collector<00:05:52.810> wires<00:05:53.050> go

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
3/4 PVC in the milk collector wires go

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.940 
3/4 PVC in the milk collector wires go
through<00:05:53.440> there<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.790> be<00:05:54.790> forced<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.350> 1/2<00:05:56.350> 1/2

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
through there to be forced to 1/2 1/2

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.550 
through there to be forced to 1/2 1/2
inch<00:05:58.200> connector<00:05:59.200> that<00:06:00.190> goes<00:06:00.250> into<00:06:01.320> 1/2<00:06:02.320> and

look<00:06:31.100> Sidious<00:06:33.039> here's<00:06:34.039> the<00:06:34.190> underside<00:06:34.759> of<00:06:34.789> the

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
look Sidious here's the underside of the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.249 
look Sidious here's the underside of the
siren<00:06:35.449> there's<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.650> motor<00:06:36.830> right<00:06:37.160> there<00:06:37.430> I

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
siren there's the motor right there I

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.740 
siren there's the motor right there I
bolted<00:06:39.259> in<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:40.310> then<00:06:40.699> I<00:06:40.940> have<00:06:41.120> some<00:06:41.330> batteries

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
bolted in and then I have some batteries

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.260 
bolted in and then I have some batteries
on<00:06:41.780> this<00:06:42.080> side<00:06:42.580> there<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:43.610> counter<00:06:44.060> weights

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
on this side there the counter weights

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.340 
on this side there the counter weights
to<00:06:44.570> balance<00:06:44.960> from<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.199> horn<00:06:46.930> this<00:06:47.930> is<00:06:47.990> the

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
to balance from the horn this is the

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.950 
to balance from the horn this is the
metal<00:06:48.620> frame<00:06:48.889> and<00:06:49.669> then<00:06:50.240> we'll<00:06:50.479> rotate<00:06:50.630> the

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
metal frame and then we'll rotate the

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.090 
metal frame and then we'll rotate the
side<00:06:51.139> around<00:06:51.470> again<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:54.530> then<00:06:54.680> I<00:06:54.740> got<00:06:54.949> a

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
side around again and then I got a

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.920 
side around again and then I got a
little<00:06:55.340> eye<00:06:55.490> bolt<00:06:55.760> on<00:06:56.000> top<00:06:56.270> like<00:06:56.600> all<00:06:56.810> the

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
little eye bolt on top like all the

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.140 
little eye bolt on top like all the
other<00:06:57.080> signs<00:06:57.320> I<00:06:57.560> hope<00:06:57.800> quite<00:06:58.550> for<00:06:58.729> this<00:06:58.880> diem

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
other signs I hope quite for this diem

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.000 
other signs I hope quite for this diem
stuff<00:06:59.479> which<00:06:59.720> is<00:06:59.750> nice

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.360 

so<00:07:04.520> there's<00:07:04.850> the<00:07:05.000> damper<00:07:05.360> in<00:07:05.450> there<00:07:06.160> and<00:07:07.160> this

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
so there's the damper in there and this

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.600 
so there's the damper in there and this
part<00:07:07.700> holds<00:07:07.940> it<00:07:08.120> up<00:07:08.240> even<00:07:08.510> more<00:07:09.400> so<00:07:10.400> we've<00:07:10.490> got

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
part holds it up even more so we've got

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.070 
part holds it up even more so we've got
the<00:07:10.760> damper<00:07:11.090> wireman<00:07:11.450> come<00:07:11.690> around<00:07:11.870> there

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
the damper wireman come around there

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.910 
the damper wireman come around there
around<00:07:12.200> the<00:07:12.440> chopper<00:07:12.830> into<00:07:13.100> that<00:07:13.250> hole

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:14.920 
around the chopper into that hole

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.810 
around the chopper into that hole
so<00:07:15.920> that's<00:07:16.070> basically<00:07:16.250> how<00:07:17.260> the<00:07:18.260> thing<00:07:18.560> works

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.890 

so<00:07:22.820> then<00:07:23.000> I<00:07:23.030> have<00:07:23.330> some<00:07:23.830> connectors<00:07:24.830> like

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
so then I have some connectors like

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.300 
so then I have some connectors like
these<00:07:26.900> little<00:07:27.110> guys<00:07:27.590> like<00:07:27.920> there<00:07:28.220> I<00:07:29.110> use<00:07:30.310> for

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310 
these little guys like there I use for

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.980 
these little guys like there I use for
connecting<00:07:31.910> the<00:07:31.970> sign<00:07:32.240> together<00:07:32.450> anymore

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
connecting the sign together anymore

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.660 
connecting the sign together anymore
inside<00:07:33.670> that's<00:07:34.670> pretty<00:07:34.910> handy<00:07:35.060> in<00:07:35.240> there<00:07:36.640> so<00:07:37.640> I

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.670 
inside that's pretty handy in there so I

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.100 
inside that's pretty handy in there so I
think<00:07:37.880> that's<00:07:38.150> the<00:07:38.240> basic<00:07:38.540> components<00:07:38.960> of<00:07:38.990> the

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
think that's the basic components of the

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.560 
think that's the basic components of the
siren
