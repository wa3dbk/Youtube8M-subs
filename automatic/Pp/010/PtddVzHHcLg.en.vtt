 between our courses that are there courses 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.850
 of autocad or techniques there to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 3d drawings 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.680
 then for anyone who wants to follow this area to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 going construction companies do this kind of 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 project we have a package with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 four courses in this area that will 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 enable you to develop 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.070
 projects like this, here's a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.160
 today's great value in the market 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.370
 because many engineers they look for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
 people who can develop this type of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 there are also some working 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.579
 engineers it is already developing then it is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.789
 a type of work you're having there 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.219
 enough market nowadays like I do not 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.079
 I have notion for technical drawing in 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.409
 course you will have the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.240
 technical drawing and I asked a teacher 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.460
 and master in engineering calls jussara 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 antunes is she who will pass to you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.860
 the modules there of cad cad 3d and 2d and that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.659
 technical drawing of project I'm 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 it's the same then these four 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.670
 courses that make up ii 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.070
 the package is of civil construction course 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.610
 have other ac models of other 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.229
 works done by 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.020
 structure is the teacher and master in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.990
 jussara engineering and are jobs that are 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 It's worth a lot there, the market does not pay. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.649
 for those who have a facility in designing 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 drawings is compensated and enter this area 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.130
 do the courses and is to leave creating 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.829
 projects because as I said it has 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 one this is very valuable nowadays in the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.899
 market for those who can develop this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.090
 kind of project I hope you 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.820
 like the following course I will leave a

 part of one of the lessons of the judge who 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.990
 already acquired the courses of CAD already know 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.629
 How does she work the students have? 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.410
 liked a lot and is an excellent

 continuity to our video lesson 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.020
 our drawing reading course 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.230
 technician 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.180
 My name is jussara antunes my channel 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.270
 stakes araçá 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.050
 if you can sign up and dj my boy 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.920
 channel 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.920
 thanks 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.850
 first we will do a review of the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.980
 previous class where we come in sight 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.210
 main view is a view showing the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:53.190
 details of the part and in this view 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:57.000
 or is a view or front view or 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.210
 an elevation view that view than 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.200
 we put ourselves in the best position in the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:08.790
 ideal position for us to achieve the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.080
 view from above or plant or sight 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.020
 higher 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.230
 we take this piece off 90 degrees and 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.620
 we looked from above and that's what we saw only 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.080
 we have this line this another line 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.370
 with that dill and the bass line 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.420
 here we have the view from above or plant 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.570
 we also did an exercise using 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:39.020
 they support this angle 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:43.800
 today we have here the distance of 25 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.519
 with the thirteen that gave trio is 38 that the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.780
 total piece height the total length 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:56.220
 is 70mm and we have the width 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.519
 overall 42 see that with these two views 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.290
 we were able to put all the 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.000
 dimensions of the parts and you can not 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.209
 forget that you can not stay 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.580
 repeating dimensions 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.580
 You must distribute la nas vii.
