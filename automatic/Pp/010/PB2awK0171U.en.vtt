00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.789 

okay<00:00:01.129> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.520> fling<00:00:04.009> so<00:00:06.440> two<00:00:07.440> fingers

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
okay this is the fling so two fingers

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.970 
okay this is the fling so two fingers
are<00:00:07.950> hook<00:00:08.130> here<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.019> that's<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.260> that's<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
are hook here and that's the that's the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.419 
are hook here and that's the that's the
mechanism<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.120> practice<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.809> pivot

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
mechanism which you practice the pivot

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.800 
mechanism which you practice the pivot
you<00:00:14.429> can<00:00:14.610> see<00:00:14.990> it<00:00:15.990> shows<00:00:16.049> where<00:00:16.470> your<00:00:16.619> hand

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
you can see it shows where your hand

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.429 
you can see it shows where your hand
lays<00:00:18.810> into<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.619> rim<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.820> palm<00:00:21.300> lays<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
lays into the rim the palm lays on to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.359 
lays into the rim the palm lays on to
the<00:00:22.590> dome<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:24.180> pivot<00:00:24.359> point<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> for

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the dome and the pivot point is and for

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
the dome and the pivot point is and for
the<00:00:26.400> sake<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.670> practice<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.539> other<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the sake of practice the other thing is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.339 
the sake of practice the other thing is
is<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.470> arrow<00:00:29.539> represents<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> two<00:00:30.869> places

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
is this arrow represents the two places

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.430 
is this arrow represents the two places
that<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.800> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:33.270> set<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.660> wrist<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that you want to be to set your wrist so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.520 
that you want to be to set your wrist so
when<00:00:34.739> you're<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.980> full<00:00:35.219> set<00:00:35.550> position<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
when you're in full set position the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
when you're in full set position the
arrow<00:00:37.739> will<00:00:37.980> basically<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:38.969> chin

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
arrow will basically point at your chin

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
arrow will basically point at your chin
and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.320> full<00:00:40.700> pivot<00:00:43.040> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and then when you're at full pivot the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
and then when you're at full pivot the
arrow<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:44.850> points<00:00:45.180> away<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.809> your

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
arrow basically points away from your

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.500 
arrow basically points away from your
chin<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> disc<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> other

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
chin so now the disc is on the other

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.110 
chin so now the disc is on the other
side<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.110> hand<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:49.700> it's<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.059> side

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
side of your hand now it's on this side

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.110 
side of your hand now it's on this side
of<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.510> wrist<00:00:52.309> now<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.820> side<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
of your wrist now it's on that side of

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.799 
of your wrist now it's on that side of
your<00:00:54.360> wrist<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.940> basically

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
your wrist and then you basically

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.130 
your wrist and then you basically
practice<00:00:58.620> using<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.930> do<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.960> out

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
practice using it like this do it out

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.480 
practice using it like this do it out
front<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:05.820> swish<00:01:07.340> there<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
front and make it really swish there you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
front and make it really swish there you
go<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.240> simulates<00:01:18.720> wrist<00:01:19.229> extension

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
go and that simulates wrist extension

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.520 
go and that simulates wrist extension
and<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> also<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.630> also<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.259> also

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and you can also you can also this also

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.070 
and you can also you can also this also
shows<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.460> four<00:01:27.119> hands<00:01:27.390> exactly<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
shows you the four hands exactly the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.910 
shows you the four hands exactly the
same<00:01:28.290> way<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:30.079> pivot<00:01:31.079> point<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.560> off<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
same way the pivot point is off the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
same way the pivot point is off the
thumb<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> finger<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> practice

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
thumb in this finger so you can practice

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
thumb in this finger so you can practice
the<00:01:34.860> same<00:01:35.040> way<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> forehand<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.600> pivots

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the same way with a forehand it pivots

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
the same way with a forehand it pivots
in<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.860> actually<00:01:38.159> stick<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.490> finger

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
in we can actually stick your finger

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.340 
in we can actually stick your finger
through<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:39.840> sure<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
through so you can make sure you got a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.080 
through so you can make sure you got a
hold<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
hold of it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
hold of it
normally<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:43.290> lock<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
normally you would have your lock on the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550 
normally you would have your lock on the
thumb<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.970> push<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.509> fingers<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
thumb and push with your fingers the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
thumb and push with your fingers the
wrist<00:01:46.799> comes<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.490> behind<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:48.090> wrist

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
wrist comes in from behind your wrist

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.690 
wrist comes in from behind your wrist
and<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> comes<00:01:49.799> through<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.310> actually

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and as it comes through is actually

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.649 
and as it comes through is actually
levered<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.450> front<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.659> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
levered out in front so you get this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.260 
levered out in front so you get this
classic<00:01:55.909> flick<00:01:56.909> English

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.599 

so<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.390> backhand<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.109> just<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.609> just

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
so the backhand is just the just

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.130 
so the backhand is just the just
opposite<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.600> actually<00:02:08.019> how

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
opposite and it it's not actually how

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.449 
opposite and it it's not actually how
it's<00:02:08.319> done<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.039> gives<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> good

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
it's done but it gives you a good

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's done but it gives you a good
example<00:02:09.610> or<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.539> good<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:12.239> good<00:02:13.239> starting<00:02:13.660> place

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
example or a good a good starting place

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
example or a good a good starting place
to<00:02:13.930> understand<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.950> doesn't<00:02:15.280> stay

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
to understand that it doesn't stay

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.059 
to understand that it doesn't stay
behind<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:16.150> hand<00:02:16.420> most<00:02:17.410> people<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:17.950> that

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
behind your hand most people think that

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.490 
behind your hand most people think that
you're<00:02:18.280> throwing<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.670> disc<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.290> just

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
you're throwing a disc and it's just

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.869 
you're throwing a disc and it's just
staying<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:20.980> behind<00:02:21.280> your<00:02:21.400> hand<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.760> then

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
staying in behind your hand and then

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.850 
staying in behind your hand and then
magically<00:02:22.269> coming<00:02:22.660> out<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.349> truth<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.680> matter

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
magically coming out the truth of matter

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.789 
magically coming out the truth of matter
is<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.190> leave<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.730> out<00:02:25.500> onto<00:02:26.500> its<00:02:26.830> own<00:02:27.010> heart<00:02:27.340> so

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
is is leave it out onto its own heart so

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.720 
is is leave it out onto its own heart so
this<00:02:29.799> is<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.019> another<00:02:32.579> couple<00:02:33.579> down

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
this is one this is another couple down
