energy to the best of their advantage so
don't<00:01:26.700> feel<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.869> you're

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
don't feel that just because you're

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
don't feel that just because you're
getting<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.229> few<00:01:28.409> butterflies<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
getting a few butterflies going on but

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.800 
getting a few butterflies going on but
you're<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> ordinary

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you're a little bit out of the ordinary

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
you're a little bit out of the ordinary
because<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.310> those<00:01:32.520> nerves

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
because if you don't get those nerves

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
because if you don't get those nerves
you're<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.840> ready<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> rock<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you're not going to be ready to rock and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
you're not going to be ready to rock and
roll<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.009> first<00:01:35.280> race<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> need<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
roll for that first race so you need to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
roll for that first race so you need to
work<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.380> rather<00:01:37.560> than<00:01:37.740> against<00:01:38.280> them

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
work with them rather than against them

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.710 
work with them rather than against them
don't<00:01:38.759> think<00:01:38.970> there's<00:01:39.150> anything<00:01:39.390> wrong<00:01:39.540> with

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
don't think there's anything wrong with

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.749 
don't think there's anything wrong with
getting<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.590> nervous<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.579> next

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
personally it was something that just

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.399 
personally it was something that just
changed<00:02:57.549> overnight<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.540> realized<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.230> if

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409
