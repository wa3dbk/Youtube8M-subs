dollars<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:34.090> year<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.360> run<00:00:34.780> which<00:00:35.530> is

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
dollars a year to run which is

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.290 
dollars a year to run which is
absolutely<00:00:36.340> unbelievable

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
absolutely unbelievable

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.299

so<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.989> way<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.260> works<00:00:38.440> it's<00:00:38.770> got<00:00:38.920> an<00:00:39.010> impeller

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
so the way it works it's got an impeller

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.369 
so the way it works it's got an impeller
in<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.640> center<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.449> impeller<00:00:40.809> shoots<00:00:41.170> the

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
in the center the impeller shoots the

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.799 
in the center the impeller shoots the
water<00:00:41.409> and<00:00:41.949> then<00:00:42.430> that<00:00:42.640> forces<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.360> water<00:00:43.540> to

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
water and then that forces the water to

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.350 
water and then that forces the water to
suck<00:00:44.320> in<00:00:44.470> through<00:00:44.739> here<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.159> shoot<00:00:45.879> out<00:00:46.089> at<00:00:46.300> a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
suck in through here and shoot out at a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.380 
suck in through here and shoot out at a
widemouth<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.790> other<00:00:48.909> thing<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:49.180> like<00:00:49.360> about

about suction caps because you just
click<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.750> magnet<00:00:59.110> onto<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.500> back<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.739> the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
you can just slide it along the back of

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.660 
you can just slide it along the back of
the<00:01:03.940> tank<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:04.900> always<00:01:05.199> opt<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.740> aim<00:01:05.920> that

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
the tank and I always opt to aim that

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.940 
the tank and I always opt to aim that
pumps<00:01:07.120> slightly<00:01:07.570> up<00:01:07.750> because<00:01:08.470> I<00:01:08.560> want<00:01:08.740> very

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
pumps slightly up because I want very

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.160 
pumps slightly up because I want very
good<00:01:09.159> surface<00:01:09.400> agitation<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.810> can<00:01:10.960> see

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
good surface agitation you can see

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.660 
good surface agitation you can see
what's<00:01:11.380> going<00:01:11.470> on<00:01:11.740> here<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.220> way<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.490> water

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
what's going on here the way the water

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.749 
what's going on here the way the water
is<00:01:12.789> agitating<00:01:13.479> across<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.899> surface<00:01:14.320> here

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
is agitating across the surface here

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.580 
is agitating across the surface here
I'll<00:01:15.759> usually<00:01:16.060> place<00:01:16.509> these<00:01:16.810> units<00:01:17.289> on<00:01:17.439> the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
I'll usually place these units on the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.719 
I'll usually place these units on the
back<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.950> aquarium<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.430> aim<00:01:18.520> and

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
back of the aquarium and aim and

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.789 
back of the aquarium and aim and
slightly<00:01:19.030> up<00:01:19.149> so<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.899> can<00:01:20.140> get<00:01:20.289> that<00:01:20.469> sort<00:01:20.740> of

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
slightly up so I can get that sort of

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.859 
slightly up so I can get that sort of
surface<00:01:21.219> agitation<00:01:21.850> because<00:01:22.600> what<00:01:22.780> I'm

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
surface agitation because what I'm

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.599 
surface agitation because what I'm
aiming<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.259> do<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.530> break<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.979> water<00:01:24.159> surface

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
aiming to do is break the water surface

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.760 
aiming to do is break the water surface
as<00:01:24.789> much<00:01:24.969> as<00:01:25.149> possible<00:01:25.390> because<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.530> break

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
as much as possible because if you break

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.319 
as much as possible because if you break
the<00:01:26.920> water<00:01:27.130> surface<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:27.670> lower<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.119> surface

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
the water surface you lower the surface

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.209 
the water surface you lower the surface
tension<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:29.079> increase<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.920> amount<00:01:30.159> of

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
tension and increase the amount of

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.870 
tension and increase the amount of
oxygen<00:01:30.399> in<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.060> aquarium<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:33.130> extremely

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
oxygen in the aquarium it's extremely

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.319 
oxygen in the aquarium it's extremely
silent<00:01:35.399> european-made<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.149> not<00:01:37.270> a

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
silent european-made so it's not a

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
silent european-made so it's not a
chinese<00:01:37.810> piece<00:01:38.109> of<00:01:38.880> equipment

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
chinese piece of equipment

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.389 
chinese piece of equipment
very<00:01:41.729> easy<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:43.369> move<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.530> change<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
very easy to move and and and change the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.899 
very easy to move and and and change the
angle<00:01:48.649> you'd<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.799> used<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> 20<00:01:50.759> mil

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
angle you'd be used in up to 20 mil

angle you'd be used in up to 20 mil
glass<00:01:51.149> there's<00:01:51.869> no<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:52.439> tanks<00:01:53.189> gonna<00:01:53.310> be

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
glass there's no way your tanks gonna be

glass there's no way your tanks gonna be
that<00:01:53.850> thick<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.780> want<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> larger<00:01:55.560> powered
