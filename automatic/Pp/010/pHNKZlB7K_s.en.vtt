oh<00:00:37.900> hey<00:00:38.079> there's<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.410> strumming<00:00:38.770> pattern<00:00:39.129> so<00:00:40.059> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.720 

so<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.230> is<00:00:56.850> Dino

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so that is Dino

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.080 
so that is Dino
time<00:01:00.750> up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:50.320 

I'll<00:01:08.090> do<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.330> slow<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:08.780> can<00:01:08.960> catch<00:01:09.619> on

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.420 

and<00:01:51.409> that's<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> showman<00:01:52.890> pattern<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and that's the showman pattern for the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
and that's the showman pattern for the
verse<00:01:53.580> on<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.420> course<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.960> given<00:01:55.260> theme

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
verse on the course is given theme

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.460 
verse on the course is given theme
courts<00:01:56.040> believe<00:01:56.940> at<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> end<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.900> verse

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
courts believe at the end of the verse

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.370 
courts believe at the end of the verse
so<00:01:58.650> it's<00:01:58.860> pre-chorus<00:01:59.750> where<00:02:00.750> she<00:02:00.900> says<00:02:01.080> keep

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
so it's pre-chorus where she says keep

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:24.809 
so it's pre-chorus where she says keep
your<00:02:01.590> eyes<00:02:01.740> open<00:02:02.190> it's<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> big

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:42.949 

and<00:02:25.719> then<00:02:25.900> into<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.409> course

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.540 

which<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.349> same<00:02:44.650> struggling<00:02:45.190> across<00:02:45.370> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
which is the same struggling across the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.770 
which is the same struggling across the
verse<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:46.120> gonna<00:02:46.360> put<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.599> in<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
verse I'm gonna put it in the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.670 
verse I'm gonna put it in the
description<00:02:47.110> if<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.860> haven't<00:02:48.190> got<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> gap<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
description if you haven't got a gap and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.710 
description if you haven't got a gap and
so<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.920> only<00:02:51.040> other<00:02:51.250> part<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:52.030> bridge<00:02:52.300> on

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
so the only other part is the bridge on

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.199 
so the only other part is the bridge on
it<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> back<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.310> where<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.580> says<00:02:54.760> keeping

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
it to the back to where it says keeping

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.670 
it to the back to where it says keeping
our<00:02:55.420> feet<00:02:55.630> ready<00:02:55.870> oh<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.980> deep

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.600 

a<00:02:59.879> minor

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
a minor

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:18.740 
a minor
see

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:47.410 

so

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.300 

this<00:03:48.080> drum<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.500> understand<00:03:48.830> there<00:03:49.069> was
