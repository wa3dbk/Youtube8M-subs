00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
the process that we go through from

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.209 
the process that we go through from
making<00:00:38.270> slices<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.020> then<00:00:39.079> take<00:00:39.860> me<00:00:40.070> into

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
making slices and then take me into

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.790 
making slices and then take me into
Dreamweaver<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.809> don't<00:00:42.079> have<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.410> band

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
website the might be picked up just off

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.200 
website the might be picked up just off
the<00:00:50.510> internet<00:00:51.100> it's<00:00:52.100> just<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.460> template<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:52.940> I

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the internet it's just a template that I

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.660 
the internet it's just a template that I
picked<00:00:53.449> up<00:00:53.600> from<00:00:53.809> one<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.949> template<00:00:55.399> sites

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
picked up from one of the template sites

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.079 
picked up from one of the template sites
one<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.210> many<00:00:56.359> 10.5<00:00:56.989> thrown<00:00:57.260> out<00:00:57.440> there<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:58.089> as

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
one of many 10.5 thrown out there and as

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.430 
one of many 10.5 thrown out there and as
you<00:00:59.359> can<00:00:59.510> see<00:00:59.539> I've<00:00:59.809> already<00:00:59.989> added<00:01:00.320> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
you can see I've already added the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.049 
you can see I've already added the
slices<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:03.140> when<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.829> do<00:01:04.070> slices<00:01:04.790> in

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
slices and this when you do slices in

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.770 
slices and this when you do slices in
your<00:01:05.540> design<00:01:06.440> it's<00:01:07.250> really<00:01:07.730> up<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.030> where

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
your design it's really up to you where

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.420 
your design it's really up to you where
you<00:01:08.810> put<00:01:09.110> them<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:11.409> I<00:01:12.409> can<00:01:12.560> pretty<00:01:12.800> much<00:01:13.100> go

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
you put them and I can pretty much go

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.649 
you put them and I can pretty much go
into<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.000> you're<00:01:14.120> not<00:01:14.240> going<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.510> get

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
into you that you're not going to get

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.030 
into you that you're not going to get
this<00:01:14.840> right<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.320> first<00:01:15.560> couple<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.979> times

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
this right the first couple of times

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.850 
this right the first couple of times
that<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:16.490> do<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.820> but<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.900> good<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.290> start

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
that you do it but it's good to start

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.390 
that you do it but it's good to start
off<00:01:19.160> go<00:01:19.820> through<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.150> process<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.100> find<00:01:22.100> out

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
off go through the process and find out

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.330 
off go through the process and find out
as<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:23.300> do<00:01:24.110> more<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.500> these<00:01:24.650> you'll<00:01:24.980> you'll

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
as you do more of these you'll you'll

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.270 
as you do more of these you'll you'll
get<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.760> learn<00:01:25.970> how<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.360> do<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.690> better<00:01:27.280> what

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
get to learn how to do it better what

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.040 
get to learn how to do it better what
I've<00:01:28.370> done<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.640> I've<00:01:28.880> created<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.690> number<00:01:29.840> of

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
I've done is I've created a number of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.680 
I've done is I've created a number of
different<00:01:30.140> slices<00:01:30.970> around<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.090> image<00:01:32.450> or

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
different slices around this image or

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.410 
different slices around this image or
lighting<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.680> buttons<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:35.630> key<00:01:35.990> text<00:01:36.470> areas

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
lighting the buttons the key text areas

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.280 
lighting the buttons the key text areas
and<00:01:38.420> I've<00:01:39.290> also<00:01:39.470> got<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> number<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.400> funny

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
and I've also got a number of funny

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.510 
and I've also got a number of funny
slices<00:01:42.290> in<00:01:42.410> here<00:01:42.620> these<00:01:43.220> will<00:01:43.400> become

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
slices in here these will become

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.300 
slices in here these will become
apparent<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:45.320> why<00:01:45.470> I've<00:01:45.530> done<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:46.010> later

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
apparent as to why I've done this later

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.640 
apparent as to why I've done this later
on<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.660> series<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:48.560> tutorials<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.030> as

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
on in the series of tutorials so as

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.570 
on in the series of tutorials so as
Abraham<00:01:51.650> said<00:01:52.330> please<00:01:53.330> slices<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:54.460> put<00:01:55.460> them

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
Abraham said please slices in put them

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.010 
Abraham said please slices in put them
wherever<00:01:55.730> you<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.420> know<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.570> feel<00:01:56.870> they're

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
wherever you you know you feel they're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.010 
wherever you you know you feel they're
necessary<00:01:57.970> one<00:01:58.970> thing<00:01:59.210> I'd<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.570> pick<00:01:59.840> up

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
necessary one thing I'd like to pick up

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.950 
necessary one thing I'd like to pick up
is<00:02:00.430> when<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.000> slices<00:02:02.480> what<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.780> need

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
is when you do the slices what you need

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.790 
is when you do the slices what you need
to<00:02:03.140> do<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.440> make<00:02:03.650> sure<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.190> numbers<00:02:04.670> or<00:02:04.910> follow

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
to do is make sure the numbers or follow

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.380 
to do is make sure the numbers or follow
correctly<00:02:06.800> so<00:02:07.070> as<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.460> see<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> number<00:02:08.030> one

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
correctly so as you can see a number one

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.949 
correctly so as you can see a number one
number<00:02:09.019> two<00:02:09.200> number<00:02:09.739> three<00:02:10.489> number<00:02:10.789> four<00:02:10.970> if<00:02:11.810> I

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
number two number three number four if I

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.170 
number two number three number four if I
come<00:02:12.200> down<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.950> see<00:02:13.160> they<00:02:13.280> go<00:02:13.459> from<00:02:13.640> 16

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
come down here you see they go from 16

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.979 
come down here you see they go from 16
to<00:02:14.209> 18<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.739> reason<00:02:16.099> here<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.760> haven't<00:02:17.599> drank

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
to 18 the reason here is I haven't drank

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.239 
to 18 the reason here is I haven't drank
this<00:02:18.650> slice<00:02:19.010> further<00:02:20.170> far<00:02:21.170> along<00:02:21.709> enough<00:02:21.739> as

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.249 
this slice further far along enough as

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.740 
this slice further far along enough as
the<00:02:22.549> screen<00:02:22.879> so

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the screen so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.440 
the screen so
I<00:02:24.130> need<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.280> make<00:02:25.430> sure<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:29.210> and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
I need to make sure that I do that and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.120 
I need to make sure that I do that and
I'll<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.840> bring<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.080> off<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
I'll just bring that off the of the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.530 
I'll just bring that off the of the
screen<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.760> can<00:02:32.000> see<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.210> this

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
screen and now you can see that this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.530 
screen and now you can see that this
number<00:02:32.870> turns<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.260> 17<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.240> time<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
number turns to 17 so this time the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.070 
number turns to 17 so this time the
terms<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.930> 17<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.450> now<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.510> know<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
terms of 17 and now we know that all the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.590 
terms of 17 and now we know that all the
slices<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.709> right<00:02:42.920> place<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.459> we<00:02:44.390> go<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
slices in the right place so we go to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.650 
slices in the right place so we go to

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
explain what we do next how we optimize

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.199 
explain what we do next how we optimize
