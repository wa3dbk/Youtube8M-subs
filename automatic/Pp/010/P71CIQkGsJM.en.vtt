 general workplace 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.369
 the dictionary with the terminology the

 formulas and suppliers at the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.820
 national let me tell you that once I

 you acquire the manual to who is also 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:34.590
 The right to receive counseling is 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.030
 Advice is via messenger or via Skype 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.119
 many of the customers 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.110
 when we are closing deal I 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 question how much should I invest for 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.240
 start a manufacturing business 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.570
 Cleaning products 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.189
 the answer is very simple and at the same time 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.040
 very complex 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.460
 what you should invest depends on the size 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.750
 of the business you want to do if you're 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.600
 thinking of a big business 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.060
 automated good then you're going to do 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.069
 a very high investment because it 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.860
 requires machinery and more and is 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.750
 automatic 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.260
 but if you are thinking about manufacturing lots 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.460
 under 200 liters you can do it in 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.040
 totally manual way and for that alone 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.790
 You need to have a small space in your 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.190
 home and sporadically use the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.710
 kitchen for some products that 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.530
 they need heating 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.190
 then in conclusion if your batch of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.340
 production are greater than 200 liters 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.100
 you need 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.940
 automated equipment if your batches of 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.770
 production are less than 200 liters 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.440
 You can do it manually then 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.760
 us when acquiring the manual we 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.690
 we are going to restore you we take 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.030
 accompaniment in the start- up of 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.730
 your business many times some clients 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.330
 they also ask me today is what are 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.700
 procedures 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.960
 If there are legal ones, what should I do? 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.510
 to start a business do not worry 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.800
 we will advise you step by step 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.770
 what are the instances 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.060
 governmental organizations to which you must go and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.770
 at what time many times is not 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.250
 necessary to do any type of procedure 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.290
 but if required we'll leave you 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.990
 advising 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.560
 then that is not 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.500
 the constraint on the other hand one of the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.700
 constraints with which we most 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.920
 we face when we want to do 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:53.400
 it's kind of business are the suppliers 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.310
 because sometimes we did not have the material to 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.900
 our reach or we do not know how 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.890
 get it because we are going with a 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.310
 provider we ask for a material and not what 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.410
 he knows because he does not know him because 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.590
 raw material suppliers 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.180
 craftily 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.289
 record with a name 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.299
 own some raw materials that is not 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.150
 they record them with the chemical name the 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.630
 real name of the subject but they put 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 a substitute name with that what they do 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.139
 is to monopolize the market in such a way 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.690
 that if a product is called the horrible 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.340
 third lack of sodium maybe they 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.110
 they put x 47 and these 47 in the same 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.470
 that the horrible third facto of sodium 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.370
 but when you are going to ask for it, notice that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.710
 I want 200 liters of aje 47 good that 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.750
 product is going to be monopolized with that 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.449
 provider and when you go with another 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.470
 different provider and they tell me to give it to me 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.449
 x 47 do not know what they mean then 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.960
 in those cases 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.259
 difficult to get the raw material but 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.089
 to avoid that confusion we to 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.300
 all our formulas we put 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:14.789
 the chemical name or the horrible 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.339
 third facto of sodium in such a way that 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.809
 when you go with a provider you do not go 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.659
 to have no problem because of age 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.749
 chemical name and automatically knows to 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:27.419
 what product are we referring to 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:30.509
