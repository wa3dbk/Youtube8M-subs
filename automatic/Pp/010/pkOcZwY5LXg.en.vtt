inside<00:03:54.319> me<00:03:54.560> say<00:03:54.799> isn't<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.579> little<00:03:55.700> late<00:03:55.849> to

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
inside me say isn't it a little late to

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.780 
inside me say isn't it a little late to
suddenly<00:03:56.719> beginning<00:03:57.049> this<00:03:57.290> family<00:03:57.739> idea<00:03:58.129> and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
suddenly beginning this family idea and

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.839 
suddenly beginning this family idea and
I<00:03:58.969> thought<00:03:59.180> well<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.870> guess<00:04:00.469> so<00:04:00.799> but<00:04:00.829> when<00:04:01.819> I

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
I thought well I guess so but when I

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.789 
I thought well I guess so but when I
look<00:04:02.090> back<00:04:02.269> on<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.900> couple<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.349> things<00:04:03.620> had

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
look back on it a couple of things had

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.530 
look back on it a couple of things had
to<00:04:03.920> really<00:04:04.129> happen<00:04:04.579> for<00:04:04.609> me<00:04:04.970> before<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.329> would

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
to really happen for me before I would

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.839 
to really happen for me before I would
even<00:04:05.569> let<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.049> idea<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.919> family<00:04:07.159> bubble<00:04:07.760> up

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
even let the idea of a family bubble up

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.369 
even let the idea of a family bubble up
into<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.120> top<00:04:08.299> of<00:04:08.419> my<00:04:08.540> consciousness<00:04:09.019> and

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
into the top of my consciousness and

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.319 
into the top of my consciousness and
that<00:04:09.530> would<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:09.859> some<00:04:10.519> modicum<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.030> success

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329
