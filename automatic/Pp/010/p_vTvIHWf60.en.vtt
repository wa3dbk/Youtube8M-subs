00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.710 
he got this back to me very quickly
ah<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> only<00:00:26.640> reason<00:00:26.910> why<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> top<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> open

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
ah the only reason why the top is open

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390 
ah the only reason why the top is open
right<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.920> tried<00:00:29.189> telling

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
right now is because I tried telling

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.919 
right now is because I tried telling
this<00:00:29.580> once<00:00:29.789> before<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.300> had<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.750> much

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this once before and they had so much

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.870 
this once before and they had so much
tape<00:00:31.230> wrapped<00:00:32.070> around<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.399> top<00:00:32.550> because<00:00:32.790> they

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
tape wrapped around the top because they

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
tape wrapped around the top because they
did<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> wonderful<00:00:33.270> job<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.690> uh<00:00:34.020> wrapping<00:00:34.860> this

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
did a wonderful job and uh wrapping this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
did a wonderful job and uh wrapping this
making<00:00:35.550> sure<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:35.910> safe<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.480> uh<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:37.800> was

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
making sure it was safe that uh it was

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.319 
making sure it was safe that uh it was
actually<00:00:38.129> hard<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.670> me<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> off<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
actually hard for me to get it off so I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually hard for me to get it off so I
just<00:00:39.450> had<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.230> pause<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> video<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
just had to actually pause the video and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
just had to actually pause the video and
cut<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> top<00:00:41.700> off<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.719> edited<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
cut the top off and I just edited that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.340 
cut the top off and I just edited that
out<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> restart<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.350> let's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
out I'm just going to restart so let's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.090 
out I'm just going to restart so let's
begin<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> everyone<00:00:48.960> -<00:00:49.079> wait<00:00:49.320> he

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
begin so we got on everyone - wait he

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
begin so we got on everyone - wait he
stacked<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.670> bubble<00:00:51.000> wrap<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:51.449> around<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
stacked with bubble wrap all around the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.369 
stacked with bubble wrap all around the
sides<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.469> top<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.370> safe<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.379> right

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
sides on top so it's very safe and right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
sides on top so it's very safe and right
on<00:00:55.559> top<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.100> course<00:00:56.370> his<00:00:56.640> uh<00:00:56.670> business<00:00:57.420> card

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
on top is of course his uh business card

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
on top is of course his uh business card
Salomon's<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:02.210> inside<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:05.119> actual<00:01:06.119> or

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
Salomon's and inside is a actual or

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.660 
Salomon's and inside is a actual or
change<00:01:06.600> itself

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.990 

so<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.770> I'm<00:01:13.770> guessing<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.790> disc

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so right here I'm guessing is the disc

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.420 
so right here I'm guessing is the disc
with<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.270> nan<00:01:15.840> KB<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.009> etc<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.780> uh

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
with the nan KB and etc on it but uh

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
with the nan KB and etc on it but uh
gonna<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.729> -<00:01:21.030> oh<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.570> says<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
gonna be - oh it just says all the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.810 
gonna be - oh it just says all the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:45.080
