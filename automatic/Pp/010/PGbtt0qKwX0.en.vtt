anyway I really like this foundation a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.870 
anyway I really like this foundation a
lot<00:00:42.230> especially<00:00:42.770> if<00:00:43.250> you're<00:00:43.400> going<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.760> be

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
lot especially if you're going to be

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.450 
lot especially if you're going to be
using<00:00:44.240> it<00:00:44.360> for<00:00:44.390> facial<00:00:44.900> concealing<00:00:45.470> it's<00:00:46.040> nice

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
using it for facial concealing it's nice

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.390 
using it for facial concealing it's nice
for<00:00:46.850> under-eye<00:00:47.180> concealing<00:00:47.829> but<00:00:48.829> I<00:00:49.040> think

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
for under-eye concealing but I think

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.640 
for under-eye concealing but I think
it's<00:00:49.730> got<00:00:50.060> a<00:00:50.270> little<00:00:50.660> bit<00:00:50.810> too<00:00:51.079> hard<00:00:51.380> of<00:00:51.560> a

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
it's got a little bit too hard of a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.280 
it's got a little bit too hard of a
consistency<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:53.240> it's<00:00:53.390> wonderful<00:00:54.260> for

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
consistency but it's wonderful for

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.140 
consistency but it's wonderful for
facial<00:00:54.829> concealing<00:00:55.310> because<00:00:55.640> it's<00:00:55.820> hard

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
facial concealing because it's hard

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.660 
facial concealing because it's hard
enough<00:00:56.300> not<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:57.230> move<00:00:57.500> all<00:00:57.860> over<00:00:58.160> your<00:00:58.340> face

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
enough not to move all over your face

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.540 
enough not to move all over your face
but<00:00:59.570> as<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.020> can<00:01:00.170> see<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.500> came<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.890> has<00:01:01.190> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
but as you can see it came to has a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.810 
but as you can see it came to has a
satiny<00:01:02.180> look<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.200> so<00:01:03.800> it's<00:01:04.070> not<00:01:04.309> going<00:01:04.699> to

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
satiny look to it so it's not going to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.450 
satiny look to it so it's not going to
look<00:01:05.059> cakey<00:01:05.630> over<00:01:06.259> your<00:01:06.439> blemish<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.159> going

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
to look like skin and that's what it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.580 
to look like skin and that's what it
looks<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.420> there<00:01:11.690> it's<00:01:11.960> definitely<00:01:12.229> a
