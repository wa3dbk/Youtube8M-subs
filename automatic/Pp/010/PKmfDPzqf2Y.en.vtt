red team on a red field well my answer
has<00:01:41.939> been<00:01:41.970> twofold<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:43.049> first<00:01:43.290> answer<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
has been twofold the first answer is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520 
has been twofold the first answer is
that<00:01:43.939> all<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.329> end<00:01:45.540> zones<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> country<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that all the end zones in the country I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
that all the end zones in the country I
think<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> color<00:01:47.490> other<00:01:47.850> than<00:01:48.030> green<00:01:48.450> every

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
think are a color other than green every

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080 
think are a color other than green every
single<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:50.340> still<00:01:50.610> manage

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
single one and people still manage

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780 
single one and people still manage
somehow<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.840> score<00:01:52.170> touchdowns<00:01:52.799> catch<00:01:53.430> passes

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
somehow to score touchdowns catch passes

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
somehow to score touchdowns catch passes
and<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.689> over<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.110> white<00:01:55.320> line<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and make it over that white line into a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.039 
and make it over that white line into a
colored<00:01:56.310> endzone<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.909> from<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.689> standpoint

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049

colored endzone so from that standpoint
I<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.560> any<00:01:58.680> different<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.759> red
