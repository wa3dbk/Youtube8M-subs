00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.510
 draw a line in america without marking it the following decimal numbers 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:16.429
 3com to four 3com to 43 i3com to 456 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.079
 if you look at the first number 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.829
 3com to four 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.829
 is between three 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.119
 and 4 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.259
 is larger than three but smaller than 4 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 let's draw a unit 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.650
 they want a rule we are going to divide 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 in ten parts 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400
 here we had interest 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 here to 4 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.520
 so here we had the 3 as a man and three commands 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.410
 it is an experience without successively 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.469
 we have divided the Indian unit into ten parts and we have cojedes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010
 so 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 He listed that they ask us is here 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 three units four tenths 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.950
 if now we look at the second number 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 escobar 43 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.980
 is a number that is included 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.280
 between 3 point four 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 itesco mar 5 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.600
 let's divide in this case a tenth in ten parts 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.050
 so we would have the 3 comma four 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.020
 puppets with +5 so that the first part yielded the 3 point 41 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.360
 the second part from 3com to 42 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.759
 in e3 comma 43 and so on 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.539
 therefore the ascended parts in which we have divided the tenth we have to 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.559
 cojedes 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.789
 and here will be the 3 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.349
 eat 43 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.349
 three units 43 hundredths 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.969
 if now we look at the third and last number 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.539
 escobar 456 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.680
 is a number between 3 comma 45 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.159
 hundredths and 3com to 46 hundredths 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 so let's draw a hundredth 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.839
 and this time we are going to divide it 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 in ten parts again helping us and a rule 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.150
 here we would have the tereshkova 45 and g3 coma 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.949
 46 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.539
 so that the first part would correspond to 3 comma 451 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.379
 the second three smokers to 152 and so on from the ten parties in that 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.599
 we have divided the hundredth 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.079
 we have to catch 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.339
 6 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.680
 one two three four five or six 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.119
 therefore here they would be 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.559
 the number three with more 456 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.649
 three units 456 thousandths
