 invite him to help me this 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.000
 part to convey to the kids what 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.119
 what artists need above 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.119
 stage 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.960
 because nobody 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.229
 Karina's voice is very strong but 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.150
 You can also have a soft voice and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 he has a very beautiful voice 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.440
 karina there is something that calls me very much 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.540
 the attention your voice is very nice but 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.640
 you are ready a lot there is to contain a 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.890
 little bit more the scream the interpretation 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.380
 of karina was very well-known knows her 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.990
 vocal ability and then it gives by 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.920
 scream others 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.660
 you have to ask in the voice of karina me 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.050
 like but I feel that who is 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.050
 much 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.959
 santi you went with karina for 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.150
 example why karina screams and then 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.849
 you also want to shout me what to take 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.040
 that and then it's going to come back many 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.200
 cries apart from that bothers the screams 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.390
 we already left the tuning the day of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.920
 the battles I have to worry about 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.420
 by my voice and do not shut up I know what 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.250
 difficult that is also when we are in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.750
 record that we are not comfortable as 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.750
 holding a note makes us very 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 hard 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.180
 for sure you cheated on me 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.750
 I'm a little intimidated by the voice of 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.459
 joe this is a very very strong voice and it's 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.459
 a great competition for me 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.110
 to compete with women is extremely 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.440
 difficult so I think you should 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.950
 surrender completely on stage 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.950
 of your memory 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.460
 ok very well very well very well very much 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.050
 better but it's in a big mess they have 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.030
 many talented children with some 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.280
 desires to succeed incredible is the part 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.500
 harder for Pedro but he has 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.330
 to deal with that situation in the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.550
 second essay should follow the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.270
 indications of your coach at the foot of the 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.520
 letter 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.820
 after this essay we will have the 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.450
 battles the moment of truth where 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.710
 let's determine which of you is going to 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.239
 win that battle 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.060
 So, well, let's see if it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.730
 applied 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:27.670
 it's better than anyone who failed me 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.920
 karina is doing very well when I say 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.950
 Do not scream and look when I was 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.950
 singing like he sang well like me 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.260
 and there are some points you have to make 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.880
 the public is part of this if I do 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.770
 this already with this I have visual contact 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.990
 with the public and if I do this I have the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.060
 visual contact with them equally 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.600
 to the front to win this battle 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.940
 I am going to interact with the public and 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.930
 what are you interacting with all the 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.930
 people who are there 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.030
 I'm batteries rang me to sing 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.030
 well to win the battles 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.419
 this group is very closed in the 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.120
 competition each one of them is going to 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.629
 require to be very careful in what I 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.629
 to decide 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.380
 very well the truth is that I do not know how 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.300
 I'm getting into so much trouble but 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.300
 I'm in trouble I'm stuck
