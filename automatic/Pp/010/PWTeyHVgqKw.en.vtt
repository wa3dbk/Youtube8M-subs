00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.660
 The artistic is a label that is not going to be caught 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.759
 what 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.840
 is important for a way of life in which life is really worthwhile 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.759
 is only in life in that sense 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.390
 becomes a work of art 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.859
 that you can say 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.470
 it's good that there is 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.390
 I don't think so 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.619
 most 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.720
 critics suspect of 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 the last few centuries 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 criticizes 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 does say to even cancel 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 the association also has an ethical approach with a castle 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.210
 I think it's a good idea 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 what adjusted 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
 manners I think 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 the discipline of ethics 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.460
 it has six chapters in which a few weeks 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 the themes related to that project as I still have it 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.640
 to explain 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.190
 those are fairly theoretical 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.490
 chapters 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.950
 but I have always interrupted that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 is a kind of interlude 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.090
 before and after each chapter 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.870
 a different kind of texts 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.490
 in which I all 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 learning is already a scientist all complexity at least whole 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.050
 emphatically 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 to drop overboard 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380
 to show something 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.670
 boeree that means one after all of our morality shows one 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 important aspect that comes back several times 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.510
 is 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.730
 and certainly that 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.229
 the racing activities falls pacific 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.769
 we are i think 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.879
 inclined too quickly 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.219
 to make 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.219
 in a way that we think it should 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.629
 and I think it is important that we 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.859
 to attempt 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.189
 the receiving 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.409
 to receive 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.329
 admissible for the 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.329
 for meaning that present itself 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.629
 receive from bast other people 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.699
 I have but I believe that has finished 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.489
 there is no artist but that is what i like from sankoh 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.019
 what i read with you 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 that they have to do a lot 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.499
 emphasis on this activity passivity also does not mean that we 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.449
 can stop like that 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.169
 that they have to do a lot, they artists 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.619
 but at the same time 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.299
 it only doctor at the moment 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.659
 you know something back 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.619
 day people happen 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:11.929
 it's just 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.529
 thanks to the fact that they are capable 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.529
 to let go 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.019
 is that there had occurred 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.679
 that the artwork is created 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.299
 And I also think that for life you had to add a lot 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 you have to constantly 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.219
 toppie clergyman 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.119
 the well-being of yourself and other people 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.429
 martin all that activity 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.719
 it is necessary that we 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.359
 cultivate responsiveness 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.709
 that enables us 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.709
 to make them 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.009
 and that way 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.539
 for place 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.459
 as a kind of dependence on 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.739
 there is a dependence on it 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.919
 could you happened to you go 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.919
 we other to your word 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.179
 I think it's a very important element of it 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.869
 tankink life 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.819
 matter but to something that is really worth it
