00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
through the map what's this this is a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.550 
through the map what's this this is a

mansion can't miss that because it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.449 
mansion can't miss that because it's

like huge place so let me show you the
inside<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:33.520> maybe<00:03:34.520> not<00:03:34.640> all<00:03:34.820> rooms<00:03:35.090> but

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
inside of it maybe not all rooms but

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.229 
inside of it maybe not all rooms but
just<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.930> get<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.530> idea<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:37.250> as<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:37.910> can<00:03:38.030> see
