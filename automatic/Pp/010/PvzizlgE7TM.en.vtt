you can put pieces of wood on and
actually<00:00:41.109> playing<00:00:41.620> them<00:00:41.859> sand<00:00:42.670> them<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:43.120> it

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
actually playing them sand them and it

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.419 
actually playing them sand them and it
doesn't<00:00:43.510> slide<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.749> bounce<00:00:44.079> so<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:44.679> can<00:00:44.859> get<00:00:44.980> of

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
doesn't slide a bounce so you can get of

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.880 
doesn't slide a bounce so you can get of
hardware<00:00:45.789> shops<00:00:46.199> put<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.289> circle<00:00:47.710> out<00:00:47.829> and

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
hardware shops put the circle out and

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.410 
hardware shops put the circle out and
I've<00:00:49.319> stapled<00:00:50.319> it<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.589> there<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.059> so<00:00:52.269> these

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
I've stapled it to there and so these

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.439 
I've stapled it to there and so these
blocks<00:00:52.719> here<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.170> stop<00:00:53.350> from<00:00:53.559> sliding<00:00:53.890> about

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
blocks here to stop from sliding about

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.149 
blocks here to stop from sliding about
its<00:00:55.449> raised<00:00:55.719> upon<00:00:56.050> this<00:00:56.229> block<00:00:56.469> here<00:00:56.679> because

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
its raised upon this block here because

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.939 
its raised upon this block here because
I<00:00:57.640> want<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:58.300> raised<00:00:58.539> up<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:58.870> my<00:00:58.989> wheel<00:00:59.199> head<00:00:59.409> you

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
I want it raised up in my wheel head you

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.229 
I want it raised up in my wheel head you
can<00:01:00.100> actually<00:01:00.219> do<00:01:00.519> away<00:01:00.729> with<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.089> just

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
put these blocks straight onto there

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.270 
put these blocks straight onto there
onto<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.089> bat<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.409> stick<00:01:05.650> this<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.950> I'm<00:01:06.220> just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
true so what this does here I don't want

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.780 
true so what this does here I don't want
to<00:02:01.630> drive<00:02:01.840> where<00:02:02.050> your<00:02:02.170> head<00:02:02.320> is<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:03.250> stops<00:02:03.580> it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
to drive where your head is it stops it

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.109 
to drive where your head is it stops it
from<00:02:03.820> spinning<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.070> put<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.369> on<00:02:06.490> just<00:02:06.670> these

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
from spinning if I put it on just these

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.020 
from spinning if I put it on just these
blocks<00:02:07.420> without<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:09.490> would<00:02:09.700> spin<00:02:09.940> on

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
blocks without this it would spin on

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.340 
blocks without this it would spin on
itself<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.510> need<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.750> put<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.899> plate<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.260> this

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
itself you need to put a plate on this

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.440 
itself you need to put a plate on this
is<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.680> avoid<00:02:11.860> boiling<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.250> pad<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.730> clay<00:02:13.270> on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
is to avoid boiling a pad of clay on

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.960 
is to avoid boiling a pad of clay on
here<00:02:13.980> I'm<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.100> throw<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> big<00:02:15.640> plate<00:02:15.940> now<00:02:16.150> and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
here I'm gonna throw a big plate now and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.610 
here I'm gonna throw a big plate now and
see<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.150> works<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.959> need<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.320> eat<00:02:20.470> my

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
see if it works so I need to eat my

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.800 
see if it works so I need to eat my
words
