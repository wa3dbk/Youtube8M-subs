welcome<00:00:00.599> to<00:00:00.750> periodic<00:00:01.230> table<00:00:01.530> layout<00:00:01.829> in<00:00:02.460> this

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
welcome to periodic table layout in this

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.039 
welcome to periodic table layout in this
lesson<00:00:02.970> we're<00:00:03.120> gonna<00:00:03.210> be<00:00:03.330> talking<00:00:03.689> about<00:00:03.780> how

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
lesson we're gonna be talking about how

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.559 
lesson we're gonna be talking about how
the<00:00:04.080> periodic<00:00:04.770> table<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.160> organized<00:00:05.640> as<00:00:06.330> well

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
the periodic table is organized as well

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.360 
the periodic table is organized as well
as<00:00:06.750> what<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.990> major<00:00:07.259> groups<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.740> elements<00:00:08.220> are

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
as what the major groups of elements are

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.700 
as what the major groups of elements are
on<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> periodic<00:00:09.240> table<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.559> have

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
on the periodic table so here we have

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.950 
on the periodic table so here we have
our<00:00:10.740> periodic<00:00:11.370> table<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.240> first<00:00:12.599> thing<00:00:12.809> we're

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
our periodic table the first thing we're

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.900 
our periodic table the first thing we're
going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> look<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:14.309> these<00:00:14.460> rows<00:00:14.880> are

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
going to look at is what these rows are

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820 
going to look at is what these rows are
called<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.660> road<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.260> across<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
called the road is going across the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
called the road is going across the
table<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.420> rows<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.960> called

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
table and so these rows are called

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.060 
table and so these rows are called
periods<00:00:20.750> because<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.439> these<00:00:22.619> periods

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
periods because it's on these periods

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.820 
periods because it's on these periods
that<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.730> properties<00:00:24.240> repeat<00:00:24.600> themselves<00:00:24.830> so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that the properties repeat themselves so

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.740 
that the properties repeat themselves so
here<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> first<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.359> second

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
here we have the first one the second

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.290 
here we have the first one the second
one<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.320> third<00:00:28.349> one<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.699> way<00:00:29.789> down<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
one the third one all the way down to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200 
one the third one all the way down to
the<00:00:30.420> seventh<00:00:30.900> period<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.700> two<00:00:33.030> down

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the seventh period now these two down

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.319 
the seventh period now these two down
here<00:00:33.719> are<00:00:34.100> actually<00:00:35.239> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.110> table<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> they

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
here are actually in the table so they

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.360 
here are actually in the table so they
don't<00:00:39.480> count<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.840> their<00:00:39.989> own<00:00:40.140> rows<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:41.219> can

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
don't count as their own rows we can

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639 
don't count as their own rows we can
also<00:00:41.550> look<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:41.969> elements<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.930> top<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
also look at elements going top to the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
also look at elements going top to the
bottom<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.160> columns<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:45.450> columns<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
bottom in columns these columns of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.880 
bottom in columns these columns of
elements<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:47.340> called<00:00:47.730> groups<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.890> families

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
elements are called groups or families

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.450 
elements are called groups or families
of<00:00:52.879> elements<00:00:54.620> groups<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.860> generally<00:00:56.039> more

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of elements groups are generally more

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340 
of elements groups are generally more
interesting<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> talk<00:00:57.329> about<00:00:57.390> because

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
interesting to talk about because

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
interesting to talk about because
elements<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> same<00:00:59.280> group<00:00:59.390> share<00:01:00.390> similar

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
elements in the same group share similar

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
elements in the same group share similar
properties<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.800> another<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.910> groups

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
properties from one another so groups

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.090 
properties from one another so groups
are<00:01:03.420> numbered<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.080> strange<00:01:04.500> there's

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
are numbered a little strange there's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
are numbered a little strange there's
actually<00:01:05.430> multiple<00:01:05.610> systems<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.510> naming

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
actually multiple systems of naming

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.109 
actually multiple systems of naming
groups<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> show<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.430> first

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
groups I'm going to show one first

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.640 
groups I'm going to show one first
that's<00:01:09.780> actually<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.200> bit<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> date

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that's actually a little bit out of date

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
that's actually a little bit out of date
and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.250> I'll<00:01:11.340> talk<00:01:11.520> about<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> more

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and then I'll talk about what the more

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
and then I'll talk about what the more
current<00:01:12.720> system<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> old<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.430> still

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
current system is but the old one still

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
current system is but the old one still
has<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.150> small<00:01:15.420> benefit<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
has one small benefit to it so this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
has one small benefit to it so this
older<00:01:17.580> system<00:01:17.939> starts<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> first<00:01:19.170> group

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
older system starts with the first group

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.240 
older system starts with the first group
as<00:01:19.770> being<00:01:19.860> labeled<00:01:20.520> 1a<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.470> next<00:01:22.860> group<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
as being labeled 1a the next group is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
as being labeled 1a the next group is
labeled<00:01:23.759> 2a<00:01:24.710> now<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.100> third<00:01:26.520> group<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.180> down

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
labeled 2a now the third group is down

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.770 
labeled 2a now the third group is down
here<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.770> three<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.729> becomes<00:01:30.090> 3b

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
here we have three but this becomes 3b

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.170 
here we have three but this becomes 3b
and<00:01:31.130> all<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> way<00:01:32.460> over<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.600> start<00:01:33.930> 3a

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
and all the way over here we start 3a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.120 
and all the way over here we start 3a
the<00:01:36.180> numbering<00:01:36.659> continues<00:01:37.140> from<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the numbering continues from there so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
the numbering continues from there so
this<00:01:38.250> becomes<00:01:38.610> 4a<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:40.159> 5a<00:01:41.720> 6a<00:01:43.670> 7a<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.570> last

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this becomes 4a and 5a 6a 7a the last

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
this becomes 4a and 5a 6a 7a the last
one<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.200> 8a<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> B<00:01:50.070> numbering<00:01:50.579> continues<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
one is 8a the B numbering continues the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.270 
one is 8a the B numbering continues the
same<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:52.040> 4b<00:01:53.119> 5b<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.829> forth<00:01:56.159> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
same way 4b 5b so on and so forth and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
same way 4b 5b so on and so forth and
actually<00:01:56.399> gets<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:56.909> weird<00:01:57.299> at<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> end

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
actually gets a little weird at the end

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
actually gets a little weird at the end
we're<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:58.890> worry<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.219> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
we're not gonna really worry about that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.330 
we're not gonna really worry about that
but<00:02:00.270> suffice<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.560> block<00:02:01.799> here

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
but suffice to say that this block here

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.969 
but suffice to say that this block here
as<00:02:02.520> well<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.540> rows<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.229> sort<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.590> stick

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
as well as these rows that sort of stick

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.910 
as well as these rows that sort of stick
into<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.520> are<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.299> B<00:02:06.869> block<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.439> elements

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
into it are all the B block of elements

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.260 
into it are all the B block of elements
and<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.729> call<00:02:08.970> those<00:02:09.229> transition<00:02:10.229> metals

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
and we call those transition metals

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
and we call those transition metals
sometimes<00:02:12.270> you'll<00:02:12.569> see<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> main<00:02:13.110> blah

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
sometimes you'll see the main blah

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
sometimes you'll see the main blah
were<00:02:13.680> referred<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.280> transition<00:02:14.880> metals

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
were referred to as transition metals

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.660 
were referred to as transition metals
and<00:02:15.480> these<00:02:16.080> two<00:02:16.350> rows<00:02:16.650> called<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.459> inner

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and these two rows called the inner

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.270 
and these two rows called the inner
transition<00:02:18.510> metals<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.860> they<00:02:19.950> sort<00:02:20.190> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
transition metals because they sort of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.790 
transition metals because they sort of
stick<00:02:20.520> into<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.780> transition<00:02:22.200> metals<00:02:22.590> they're

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
stick into the transition metals they're

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.620 
stick into the transition metals they're
inside<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
inside of it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.270 
inside of it
they're<00:02:24.630> called<00:02:24.870> transition<00:02:25.530> metals<00:02:25.860> because

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
they're called transition metals because

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.150 
they're called transition metals because
they<00:02:26.400> transition<00:02:27.060> from<00:02:27.560> basically<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.860> left

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
they transition from basically the left

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.290 
they transition from basically the left
a<00:02:29.340> groups<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.140> groups<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.120> let's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
a groups to the right a groups so let's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.809 
a groups to the right a groups so let's
write<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> down<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.910> B<00:02:36.180> block<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.780> elements

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
write that down the B block of elements

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.530 
write that down the B block of elements
our<00:02:39.380> transition<00:02:40.380> metals<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> name

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
our transition metals that's the name

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.199 
our transition metals that's the name
for<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.930> category<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.650> elements<00:02:44.130> let's<00:02:45.060> look

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
for that category of elements let's look

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.390 
for that category of elements let's look
at<00:02:45.300> some<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> other<00:02:45.780> name<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.769> categories

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
at some of the other name the categories

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.190 
at some of the other name the categories
that<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.269> are<00:02:48.420> important<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> be<00:02:48.959> aware

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that are that are important to be aware

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320 
that are that are important to be aware
of<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.070> have<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> first<00:02:50.519> group<00:02:50.910> all<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
of so we have the first group all the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
of so we have the first group all the
way<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.750> left<00:02:52.019> that's<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.920> group

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
way on the left that's the one a group

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.199 
way on the left that's the one a group
1a<00:02:53.970> elements<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:54.959> referred<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:56.209> alkali

the<00:03:07.230> other<00:03:07.440> two<00:03:07.709> notable<00:03:08.160> groups<00:03:08.489> are<00:03:08.730> all<00:03:08.880> on

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the other two notable groups are all on

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.040 
the other two notable groups are all on
the<00:03:09.090> other<00:03:09.269> side<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.930> table<00:03:10.140> 7a<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.280> 8a<00:03:12.050> 7a

the other side of the table 7a and 8a 7a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.290 
the other side of the table 7a and 8a 7a
is<00:03:13.080> right<00:03:13.410> here<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:13.980> these<00:03:14.850> are<00:03:15.030> called

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
is right here and these are called

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.640 
is right here and these are called
halogens<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:17.250> 7a<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.720> called<00:03:19.110> halogens<00:03:21.650> 8a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
halogens so 7a are called halogens 8a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.130 
halogens so 7a are called halogens 8a
the<00:03:23.400> last<00:03:23.670> group<00:03:23.970> all<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.420> way<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.959> right

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.250 
the last group all the way on the right
side<00:03:25.440> are<00:03:25.950> called<00:03:26.610> noble<00:03:26.940> gases<00:03:27.540> or<00:03:27.750> inert

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
side are called noble gases or inert

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.490 
side are called noble gases or inert
gases<00:03:29.480> we<00:03:30.480> call<00:03:30.720> them<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.019> because<00:03:31.290> they

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
gases we call them that because they

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.380 
gases we call them that because they
don't<00:03:31.890> react<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.459> any<00:03:32.640> other<00:03:32.850> elements

don't react with any other elements

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.199 
don't react with any other elements
they're<00:03:34.110> inert<00:03:34.530> they<00:03:34.769> don't<00:03:35.040> react<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.030> other

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
they're inert they don't react the other

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.360 
they're inert they don't react the other
groups<00:03:36.780> are<00:03:37.049> typically<00:03:37.500> called<00:03:37.829> families

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
groups are typically called families

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.030 
groups are typically called families
based<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> first<00:03:39.390> element<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.680> for

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
based on the first element so for

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.660 
based on the first element so for
example<00:03:41.430> for<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.600> carbon<00:03:43.049> family<00:03:43.620> 5<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
example for a is the carbon family 5 a

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.479 
example for a is the carbon family 5 a
is<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.060> nitrogen<00:03:45.269> family<00:03:45.930> 6<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.100> oxygen

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
is the nitrogen family 6 a is the oxygen

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.690 
is the nitrogen family 6 a is the oxygen
family<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.590> reason<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.070> showed<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.489> this

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
family but the reason I showed you this

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.099 
family but the reason I showed you this
numbering<00:03:51.209> system<00:03:51.600> even<00:03:51.900> though<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.079> a

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
numbering system even though it's a

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.680 
numbering system even though it's a
little<00:03:52.200> bit<00:03:52.320> out<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.560> date<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:54.120> these

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
little bit out of date is because these

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.590 
little bit out of date is because these
numbers<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> format<00:03:56.880> are<00:03:57.239> actually

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
numbers in the a format are actually

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.900 
numbers in the a format are actually
pretty<00:03:57.810> helpful<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:59.010> look<00:03:59.160> at<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.400> format

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
pretty helpful if you look at the format

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
pretty helpful if you look at the format

numbered<00:04:29.499> groups<00:04:33.090> now<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.150> B<00:04:34.659> block<00:04:35.319> isn't<00:04:35.800> so

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
numbered groups now the B block isn't so

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.529 
numbered groups now the B block isn't so
helpful<00:04:36.400> in<00:04:36.580> how<00:04:36.729> its<00:04:36.909> numbered<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.419> it

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
helpful in how its numbered and it

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.899 
helpful in how its numbered and it
actually<00:04:37.719> gets<00:04:38.020> pretty<00:04:38.319> confusing<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:39.669> these

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
actually gets pretty confusing so these

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.149 
actually gets pretty confusing so these
days<00:04:40.180> there's<00:04:40.599> another<00:04:40.810> system<00:04:41.289> of<00:04:41.499> numbering

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
days there's another system of numbering

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.269 
days there's another system of numbering
all<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.610> these<00:04:42.789> and<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:44.590> actually<00:04:45.009> very

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
all of these and it's actually very

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:53.029 
all of these and it's actually very
straightforward<00:04:45.699> it<00:04:46.659> goes<00:04:46.840> 1<00:04:47.229> 2<00:04:48.150> 3<00:04:49.150> 4<00:04:50.110> 5<00:04:50.860> 6<00:04:51.699> 7<00:04:52.659> 8

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
straightforward it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:04:53.039 --> 00:05:01.110 
straightforward it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:04:54.039> 10<00:04:54.520> 11<00:04:54.789> 12<00:04:55.090> 13<00:04:55.479> 14<00:04:55.930> 15<00:04:56.560> 16<00:04:57.520> 17<00:04:58.259> 18<00:04:59.729> so<00:05:00.729> dot<00:05:00.939> dot

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 so dot dot

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.879 
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 so dot dot
dot<00:05:01.539> you<00:05:01.569> can<00:05:01.750> fill<00:05:02.110> in<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.289> rest<00:05:02.319> you<00:05:02.650> get<00:05:02.740> the

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
dot you can fill in the rest you get the

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:03.390 
dot you can fill in the rest you get the
idea

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
idea

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.730 
idea
this<00:05:03.729> is<00:05:03.879> numbered<00:05:04.210> 1<00:05:04.479> through<00:05:04.509> 18<00:05:04.930> without

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
this is numbered 1 through 18 without

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.339 
this is numbered 1 through 18 without
any<00:05:06.069> sort<00:05:06.370> of<00:05:06.460> change<00:05:06.909> in<00:05:07.240> numbering<00:05:07.930> pattern

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
any sort of change in numbering pattern

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.529 
any sort of change in numbering pattern
and<00:05:09.039> this<00:05:09.189> is<00:05:09.279> what<00:05:09.430> we<00:05:09.550> have<00:05:09.729> now<00:05:09.969> it's<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.360> lot

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
and this is what we have now it's a lot

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.480 
and this is what we have now it's a lot
more<00:05:10.719> straightforward<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:12.039> it<00:05:12.129> doesn't<00:05:12.400> give

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
more straightforward but it doesn't give

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.670 
more straightforward but it doesn't give
you<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:12.610> helpful<00:05:13.029> idea<00:05:14.020> about<00:05:14.319> what<00:05:14.560> the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
you that helpful idea about what the

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.200 
you that helpful idea about what the
valence<00:05:15.039> electrons<00:05:15.490> are<00:05:15.699> in<00:05:15.879> a<00:05:15.939> particular

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
valence electrons are in a particular

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.380 
valence electrons are in a particular
group

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.960

that wraps up our lesson on the periodic
table<00:05:22.120> layout<00:05:22.660> we<00:05:23.380> talked<00:05:23.590> about<00:05:23.680> groups<00:05:24.070> and

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
table layout we talked about groups and

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.460 
table layout we talked about groups and
families<00:05:24.790> we<00:05:25.600> talked<00:05:25.810> about<00:05:26.020> how<00:05:26.200> you<00:05:26.260> can

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
families we talked about how you can

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.320 
families we talked about how you can
determine<00:05:26.740> valence<00:05:27.220> electrons<00:05:27.670> from<00:05:28.090> the

determine valence electrons from the
group<00:05:28.600> number<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.140> we<00:05:29.710> also<00:05:29.860> talked<00:05:30.220> about

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
group number and we also talked about

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.070 
group number and we also talked about
what<00:05:30.670> some<00:05:30.850> of<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.060> names<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.570> those<00:05:31.720> groups

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
what some of the names of those groups

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.110 
what some of the names of those groups
are<00:05:32.320> any<00:05:33.190> questions<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.700> have<00:05:33.730> from<00:05:34.000> this

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
are any questions you have from this

lesson make sure you write them down in

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.570 
lesson make sure you write them down in
your<00:05:35.590> notes<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:35.980> bring<00:05:36.190> them<00:05:36.340> with<00:05:36.460> you<00:05:36.550> to

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
your notes and bring them with you to

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.820 
your notes and bring them with you to
