sims 4 for the sims 3 I really want to
do<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:12.900> me<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.260> takes<00:02:13.440> me<00:02:13.620> hours

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
do that but for me it takes me hours

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.790

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
seriously hours to create just one sim

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.699 
seriously hours to create just one sim
mostly<00:02:17.760> because<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.600> takes<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:19.140> long<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
mostly because it takes really long to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.300 
mostly because it takes really long to
load<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.930> outfits<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.350> tops<00:02:23.010> and

I haven't sat down and done a let's
create<00:02:37.860> video<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.520> sims<00:02:38.790> 3<00:02:39.030> because<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.570> just

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
create video and sims 3 because it just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.020 
create video and sims 3 because it just
it<00:02:39.930> takes<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.410> long<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.950> simply<00:02:41.610> don't<00:02:41.910> have

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it takes so long and I simply don't have

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.880 
it takes so long and I simply don't have
enough<00:02:42.150> time<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.600> do<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.020> hopefully<00:02:43.739> i'll

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
enough time to do that so hopefully i'll

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.740 
enough time to do that so hopefully i'll
be<00:02:43.920> able<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.580> more<00:02:44.850> often<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.600> for

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
be able to do that more often but for
