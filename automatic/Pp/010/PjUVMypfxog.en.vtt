fellas<00:00:38.750> on<00:00:39.700> this<00:00:40.700> one<00:00:40.879> here<00:00:41.059> that<00:00:41.090> I'm<00:00:41.270> holding

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
fellas on this one here that I'm holding

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.970 
fellas on this one here that I'm holding
is<00:00:41.690> actually<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.079> factory<00:00:42.500> blow-off<00:00:42.620> valve

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
is actually the factory blow-off valve

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.630 
is actually the factory blow-off valve
that<00:00:43.129> we<00:00:43.280> took<00:00:43.489> off<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.690> WRX<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:46.370> works

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
that we took off of the WRX and it works

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.490 
that we took off of the WRX and it works
it<00:00:47.149> does<00:00:47.360> what<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:47.629> supposed<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.989> do<00:00:48.200> for<00:00:48.470> a

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
it does what it's supposed to do for a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.950 
it does what it's supposed to do for a
stock<00:00:48.800> car<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.370> that's<00:00:49.550> great<00:00:49.760> it's<00:00:50.690> made<00:00:50.870> out

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
stock car so that's great it's made out

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.990 
stock car so that's great it's made out
of<00:00:50.989> plastic<00:00:51.200> which<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.829> pretty<00:00:52.310> typical<00:00:52.610> of

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
of plastic which is pretty typical of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.440 
of plastic which is pretty typical of
most<00:00:53.239> modern<00:00:53.480> blow-off<00:00:53.840> valves<00:00:54.200> these<00:00:54.410> days

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
most modern blow-off valves these days

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.510 
most modern blow-off valves these days
in<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.989> first<00:00:57.230> one<00:00:57.410> we<00:00:57.560> tested<00:00:57.950> was<00:00:58.040> actually

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
in the first one we tested was actually

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.630 
in the first one we tested was actually
the<00:00:58.670> turbo<00:00:59.060> smart<00:00:59.360> dual<00:01:00.170> port<00:01:00.530> which<00:01:01.220> you<00:01:01.430> can

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
the turbo smart dual port which you can

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.550 
the turbo smart dual port which you can
see<00:01:01.910> here<00:01:03.549> now<00:01:04.549> first<00:01:05.210> things<00:01:05.449> first

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
see here now first things first

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.350 
see here now first things first
obviously<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.610> lot<00:01:07.759> prettier<00:01:08.030> than

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
obviously it's it's a lot prettier than

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.810 
obviously it's it's a lot prettier than
mean<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.750> billet<00:01:09.380> construction<00:01:10.040> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
mean this is billet construction the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.410 
mean this is billet construction the
quality<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:11.439> ridiculously<00:01:12.439> awesome<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:13.759> it's

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
quality is ridiculously awesome and it's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.539 
quality is ridiculously awesome and it's
a<00:01:14.540> dual<00:01:14.780> port<00:01:15.140> design<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:15.920> what<00:01:16.369> does<00:01:16.520> that

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
a dual port design so what does that

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.090 
a dual port design so what does that
mean<00:01:16.909> well<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.750> factory<00:01:18.259> blow-off<00:01:18.409> valve<00:01:18.860> or

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
mean well the factory blow-off valve or

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.300 
mean well the factory blow-off valve or
recirculating<00:01:19.759> valve<00:01:19.999> is<00:01:20.299> just<00:01:20.810> that

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
recirculating valve is just that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.739 
recirculating valve is just that
recirculates<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.909> air<00:01:23.060> back<00:01:23.359> into<00:01:23.569> the

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
recirculates the air back into the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.260 
recirculates the air back into the
intake<00:01:24.049> stream<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.619> lot<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.399> modern<00:01:25.700> vehicles

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
intake stream a lot of modern vehicles

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.279 
intake stream a lot of modern vehicles
that<00:01:26.359> have<00:01:26.770> mass<00:01:27.770> airflow<00:01:28.039> sensor<00:01:29.289> record

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
that have mass airflow sensor record

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.599 
that have mass airflow sensor record
that<00:01:30.469> air<00:01:30.619> that's<00:01:30.649> coming<00:01:31.069> back<00:01:31.249> out<00:01:31.459> of<00:01:31.490> it

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
that air that's coming back out of it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.550 
that air that's coming back out of it
and<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:31.880> needs<00:01:32.029> that<00:01:32.179> to<00:01:32.689> run<00:01:32.869> properly<00:01:33.170> or

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
and it needs that to run properly or

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.340 
and it needs that to run properly or
prevent<00:01:34.130> stalling<00:01:34.789> or<00:01:35.060> any<00:01:35.659> kind<00:01:35.959> of<00:01:36.020> vital

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
prevent stalling or any kind of vital

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.999 
prevent stalling or any kind of vital
issues<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.799> stuff<00:01:36.950> like<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.749> a<00:01:38.749> dual<00:01:39.709> port

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
issues and stuff like that a dual port

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.830 
issues and stuff like that a dual port
design<00:01:40.340> kind<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.819> gives<00:01:40.969> you<00:01:41.029> the<00:01:41.539> best<00:01:41.689> of

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
design kind of gives you the best of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.649 
design kind of gives you the best of
both<00:01:42.020> worlds<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:43.219> allows<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.240> recirculate

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
both worlds it allows you to recirculate

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.349 
both worlds it allows you to recirculate
just<00:01:45.349> like<00:01:45.499> the<00:01:45.619> factory<00:01:46.069> does<00:01:46.279> but<00:01:47.149> as<00:01:47.240> you

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
just like the factory does but as you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.589 
just like the factory does but as you
can<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.509> on<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.380> other<00:01:48.560> side<00:01:48.889> here

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
can see on this the other side here

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.849 
can see on this the other side here
there's<00:01:50.599> another<00:01:50.899> valve<00:01:51.289> which<00:01:51.709> will

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
there's another valve which will

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.709 
there's another valve which will
actually<00:01:52.009> vent<00:01:52.429> some<00:01:52.909> of<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.179> out<00:01:53.420> into<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
actually vent some of that out into the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.929 
actually vent some of that out into the
atmosphere<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:55.130> get<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:55.459> cool<00:01:55.639> woosh

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
atmosphere so you get that cool woosh

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.760 
atmosphere so you get that cool woosh
sound<00:01:55.969> that<00:01:56.630> everybody<00:01:56.990> alike

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
sound that everybody alike

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.899 
sound that everybody alike
big<00:01:59.770> difference<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.310> mean<00:02:00.429> if<00:02:00.609> we<00:02:00.729> look

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
big difference I mean if we look

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.969 
big difference I mean if we look
underneath<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.109> piston<00:02:02.649> of<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
underneath here the the piston of the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.249 
underneath here the the piston of the
factory<00:02:03.549> blows<00:02:03.789> out<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.270> little<00:02:04.420> silver<00:02:04.869> dot

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
factory blows out that little silver dot

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.169 
factory blows out that little silver dot
there<00:02:05.530> that's<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.399> actual<00:02:06.700> size<00:02:06.969> of<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
there that's the actual size of the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.960 
there that's the actual size of the
piston<00:02:07.570> on<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.719> factory<00:02:08.080> one<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.550> compare

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
piston on the factory one if you compare

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.570 
piston on the factory one if you compare
that<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.780> turbosmart<00:02:11.290> unit<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:12.129> quite<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
that to the turbosmart unit it's quite a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.750 
that to the turbosmart unit it's quite a
bit<00:02:12.760> larger<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:14.410> mean<00:02:14.980> biggest<00:02:15.340> advantage

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
bit larger so I mean biggest advantage

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.789 
bit larger so I mean biggest advantage
really<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.150> gonna<00:02:16.330> be<00:02:16.420> people<00:02:16.720> who<00:02:17.019> are<00:02:17.379> gonna

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
really are gonna be people who are gonna

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.170 
really are gonna be people who are gonna
be<00:02:17.890> running<00:02:18.250> more<00:02:18.370> boost<00:02:18.670> pressure<00:02:18.970> than

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180

some guys that are going to be doing a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.650 
some guys that are going to be doing a
larger<00:02:24.400> turbos<00:02:24.819> than<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> factory<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.569> if

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
larger turbos than the factory and if

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.610 
larger turbos than the factory and if
we're<00:02:25.780> gonna<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:25.989> running<00:02:26.260> more<00:02:26.440> buoys

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
we're gonna be running more buoys

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.070 
we're gonna be running more buoys
pressure<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.940> factory<00:02:28.269> ones<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.690> tend<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
pressure the factory ones can tend to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.039 
pressure the factory ones can tend to
leak<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.819> we<00:02:30.819> don't<00:02:30.970> want<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.239> because<00:02:31.840> then

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
leak and we don't want that because then

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.309 
leak and we don't want that because then
we<00:02:32.260> lose<00:02:32.769> power<00:02:33.510> whereas<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.780> turbo<00:02:35.049> smart

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
we lose power whereas the turbo smart

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.960 
we lose power whereas the turbo smart
obviously<00:02:36.299> more<00:02:37.299> robust<00:02:37.750> design<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.849> this<00:02:39.849> is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
obviously more robust design and this is

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.339 
obviously more robust design and this is
going<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.180> hold<00:02:40.329> quite<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> bit<00:02:41.049> more<00:02:41.200> boost

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
going to hold quite a bit more boost

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.630 
going to hold quite a bit more boost
pressure<00:02:41.739> than<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.980> factory<00:02:42.280> one<00:02:42.459> will

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
pressure than the factory one will

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.449 
pressure than the factory one will
prevent<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.180> leaking<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.250> we'll<00:02:45.250> take

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
prevent that from leaking so we'll take

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.130 
prevent that from leaking so we'll take
this<00:02:45.610> one<00:02:45.849> out<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.329> spin<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:46.959> kind

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
this one out for a spin so you can kind

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.270 
this one out for a spin so you can kind
of<00:02:47.170> hear<00:02:47.319> out<00:02:47.470> sounds<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:47.950> we'll<00:02:48.069> go<00:02:48.160> from

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
of hear out sounds and we'll go from

00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:14.830 
of hear out sounds and we'll go from
there

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:25.510
