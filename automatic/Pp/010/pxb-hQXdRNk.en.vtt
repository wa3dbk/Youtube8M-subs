00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.520
 hello together to the word com / de weeks 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.129
 view from the 13th of january to the 19th 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.639
 january we start the topics with the 13 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.430
 January 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.020
 and that will be pretty likely 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.689
 one of the next tree-tops hunting 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.020
 panzer he 100 means that is for 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.550
 all those who are not enough at the moment 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.380
 but credits have this armor 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.330
 please, please wait 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.210
 until february from then this should be 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.129
 come here and the eight nine and ten 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.629
 he hunts around 1900 to be discounted 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.569
 the developer diary on 13 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.850
 has brought along the following and indeed 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.789
 the developers probably have player maps 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.069
 Design and then tested 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.539
 but this cartman in the unplayable that 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.329
 is of course always a common topic 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.069
 the cards in the game 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.510
 but as I said the developers in the 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.940
 usually they already know what they are doing 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.370
 that's why this experiment is well 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.270
 failed on january 14th there was something 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.189
 and a few very nice links 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.049
 after seeing the minimap of the new card 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.090
 wind storm probably in german 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.630
 the wind storm has been published 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.799
 Then there were some of them again 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 Of course you can see pictures here very much 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.490
 beautiful 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.079
 So just have a look 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.119
 I think that will be a lot 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 interesting card also there was a 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.899
 couple mix from the super test and that too 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.929
 cards currently exist but 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.270
 just to be revised under it 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.259
 has is coco rocha ellenberg hemmelsdorf 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.899
 and expensive 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.659
 and the biggest changes now 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.520
 give a borowka 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.520
 Here are some of the pictures 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 also just more consistent with the crater 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.049
 and all in all, then look 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.299
 Rest in silence and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.060
 otherwise hemmelsdorf comes in one 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.980
 winter execution 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.260
 this will be separate to the normal one 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.390
 execution in the web tool that's it 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.950
 Both maps will come and you can 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.110
 so to speak one after the other possibly up 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.880
 both ellenberg also here you will see 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.540
 In general, there is something about the pictures 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.700
 kept flatter 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.800
 whether that will be beneficial to the game 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.910
 or even harder you get 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:43.140
 then see you soon so far and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:46.209
 savior also a bit flatter and the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.160
 base point is fought at encounter 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.010
 as you can see quite well here too 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.459
 So something will be put back here 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.430
 new the developer diary on the 14th 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.840
 then said that currently not 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.900
 it is planned that one small and medium 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.400
 These stones are destructible 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.690
 unfortunately still and will after 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.000
 to stay an obstacle 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.320
 maybe this will change but there 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.130
 we have to be patient now 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.299
 have and see what happens 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.700
 Developer Diary on 15 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.459
 there was said to be just shown 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.760
 prokhorov k that this revised 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.320
 version unfortunately only with zero points 0 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.640
 90 will appear 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.430
 So here, please be patient too 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.560
 were on the fifteenth of the super test 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.390
 a few moving pictures to mine 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.690
 Sorry a couple or a picture 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.280
 all icons from the super test and man 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.260
 Of course, now sees a lot of tanks 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.959
 you might not have seen it that way yet 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.880
 Like what I have a super hero or the one 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.230
 German e10, please, but not now 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.060
 look forward to these tanks coming 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.859
 or especially the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.959
 Germany akrri motor that are easy 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.859
 pictures in the game means but 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.019
 not that these tanks 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.480
 are planned or will come the are 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.470
 simply up to date in the client means 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.470
 the game itself does not lead to any cards 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.870
 Change 08 11 there is also here again 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.440
 the whole picture has been shown in the us app video 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.340
 and that is just something about northwest 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.600
 Just keep the pictures here too 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.570
 again click through in peace 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.250
 Highway is being reworked very strong 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.500
 even so it could almost be a new one 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.640
 So map look like this from here 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.290
 it's definitely on it 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.590
 Worth seeing developer Diary on 16 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.870
 It was said that the light 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.580
 us-line revised earlier than thought 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.500
 So there is driver in every suffering 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.780
 Here is the happy customer 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.430
 hopefully not too long and 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.820
 your tanks will be overhauled 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.950
 patches to 08 11 are from storm too 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.120
 to developer party in the developer blog 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.920
 been published 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.350
 that means just take a look here 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.420
 there is the most in it on her 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.740
 you can also look forward to the example 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.740
 new modes of struggle 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.350
 Developer Diary on 17 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.050
 was a bit bitter for sth 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.450
 driver among you and for one of the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.080
 Waffenträger on more than 100 stands here 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.669
 the tubs when the speed 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.140
 Target accuracy is reduced 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.570
 The tour turns is reduced and 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.370
 The speed of rotation of the tower becomes 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.410
 also reduces the are allowed to you to 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.500
 Waffenträger their 100 come and 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:31.180
 at the same time the alpha damage of the subject 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.280
 155 value reduced from 850 to 750 and 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.440
 but it does not continue to do that 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.060
 It is called a pure neff for the 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.490
 Fach will be distinguished with new ones 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.030
 0 8 11 also give new medals 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.150
 These were then almost isaf thank you 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.250
 there again translated caliber in the main 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.410
 and also what you have to fulfill 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.750
 So here it will be a couple of very nice ones 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.850
 new medals give easy 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.380
 see through and read through 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.790
 I think that can be one or the other 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.520
 very happy developer diary on 18 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.740
 again a little nervous for the tg 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.830
 driver here it is also a he 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.480
 then a revision and that of the 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.290
 Alfa is known to be reduced by 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.510
 e3 and e4 but get the but 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.640
 then an increased shot 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.410
 turn the damage per minute on the 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.860
 should bring the same level that is 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.270
 in front 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.650
 the damage in the minute will be 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.430
 do not change anything that is just one 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.590
 reduction of alpha then look what 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.180
 not necessarily to world of tanks though 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.530
 nevertheless a very important topic 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.699
 what a lot of players are waiting for 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:43.569
 world of warcraft two 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.669
 Pictures, so to speak, first pictures from the 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.569
 card one should it a farmer 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.509
 should be that 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.129
 Of course you can see a screenshot here 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.199
 but still 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.379
 you can a little bit the 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.919
 imagine setting from the map and that 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.629
 second picture but then here me 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.990
 visually really think one 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:06.759
 nice round thing afterwards the minimap 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.300
 The cards are in the relationship 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:14.229
 top view and last but not least the 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.810
 Ships will give it this way too 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:21.490
 I think very nice worth seeing 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:23.680
 You can look forward to it then 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.909
 last but not least the developer diary of 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.610
 19 january 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:30.159
 and here for all tg driver 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.639
 especially for all premium lovers it 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:35.319
 it is not American t8 in it 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.360
 premium planned at the moment 

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:39.190
 that is to say each of the on da 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.680
 One day rejoiced the animal eight area 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.819
 unfortunately, you have to be here with americans 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.430
 disappoint 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:47.349
 when one comes then one can 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.289
 but currently say please on it 

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:52.779
 do not wait and then speculate 

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:54.699
 That 's it with this week I hope so 

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:56.500
