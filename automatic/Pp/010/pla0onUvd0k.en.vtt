to<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> inner<00:03:19.799> corner<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> am<00:03:23.579> moving

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
to the inner corner so now I am moving

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.839 
to the inner corner so now I am moving
on<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.450> actual<00:03:24.750> creation<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.579> cat<00:03:26.819> eye

and<00:03:27.920> really<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.160> am<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.329> going<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.840> trace

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
and really I am just going to trace

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.240 
and really I am just going to trace
along<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:32.459> start<00:03:33.139> at<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.380> outer<00:03:34.530> corner<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
along I start at the outer corner and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.860 
along I start at the outer corner and
flick<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.760> outward<00:03:38.209> then<00:03:39.209> flick<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> inward

00:03:41.870 --> 00:04:17.730 
flick it outward then flick it inward
so<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:42.890> keep<00:03:43.099> tracing<00:03:43.610> along

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:17.740 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.110
