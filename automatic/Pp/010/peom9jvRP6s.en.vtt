I'm<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.739> tinder<00:03:42.920> now<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.340> I've<00:03:43.430> lectured

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
I'm on tinder now and I've lectured

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.640 
I'm on tinder now and I've lectured
about<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.330> so<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.959> find<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.350> connection

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
about that and so you find a connection

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.289 
about that and so you find a connection
with<00:03:45.890> somebody<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.580> starts<00:03:46.940> maybe<00:03:47.180> a

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
with somebody and it starts maybe a

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.570 
with somebody and it starts maybe a
process<00:03:47.780> although<00:03:47.989> sometimes<00:03:48.320> people<00:03:49.040> after

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
process although sometimes people after

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.880 
process although sometimes people after
even<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.940> match<00:03:50.120> they<00:03:50.570> won't<00:03:50.989> even<00:03:51.140> connect

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
even a match they won't even connect

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.770 
even a match they won't even connect
with<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.180> doesn't<00:03:53.510> really<00:03:53.630> change

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
with you so it doesn't really change

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.580 
with you so it doesn't really change
your<00:03:54.410> own<00:03:54.829> inner<00:03:55.900> makeup<00:03:56.900> if<00:03:57.110> you're<00:03:57.320> still

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
your own inner makeup if you're still
