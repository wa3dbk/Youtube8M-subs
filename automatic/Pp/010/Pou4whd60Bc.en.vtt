00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.090 

I<00:00:18.250> think<00:00:19.030> the<00:00:19.150> future<00:00:19.540> is<00:00:20.260> something<00:00:20.620> that<00:00:20.950> we

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
I think the future is something that we

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.200 
I think the future is something that we
define<00:00:21.430> ourselves

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
define ourselves

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.860 
define ourselves
I<00:00:22.470> look<00:00:23.470> at<00:00:23.680> 50<00:00:24.400> times<00:00:24.940> I've<00:00:25.240> been<00:00:25.420> around<00:00:25.660> the

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
I look at 50 times I've been around the

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.010 
I look at 50 times I've been around the
Sun<00:00:26.110> and<00:00:26.380> wonder<00:00:27.160> what<00:00:27.310> that<00:00:27.490> NYX<00:00:27.900> 5600<00:00:28.900> is

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
Sun and wonder what that NYX 5600 is

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.960 
Sun and wonder what that NYX 5600 is
going<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.500> be<00:00:29.680> about<00:00:29.980> some<00:00:30.580> of<00:00:30.670> stuff<00:00:30.850> I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
going to be about some of stuff I

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.910 
going to be about some of stuff I
thought<00:00:31.210> was<00:00:31.420> millennial<00:00:31.869> tech<00:00:32.110> maybe<00:00:32.529> stuff

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
thought was millennial tech maybe stuff

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.950 
thought was millennial tech maybe stuff
that's<00:00:33.100> just<00:00:33.280> 10<00:00:33.430> years<00:00:33.610> down<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.910> road

out there I can't imagine that the one

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.480 
out there I can't imagine that the one
spark<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.910> led<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.210> life<00:02:21.110> here<00:02:21.710> on<00:02:21.740> earth<00:02:22.100> did

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
spark that led to life here on earth did

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.720 
spark that led to life here on earth did
not<00:02:22.520> lead<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.030> sparks<00:02:23.960> of<00:02:24.110> life

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.790 

what<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.209> today<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.620> give<00:02:29.769> us

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
what can we do today to give us

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.460 
what can we do today to give us
something<00:02:30.220> better<00:02:31.000> tomorrow<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:32.170> try<00:02:32.349> and

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
something better tomorrow to try and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.420 
something better tomorrow to try and
make<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.680> world<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.950> better<00:02:32.980> place

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
make the world a better place

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.330 
make the world a better place
through<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> know<00:02:34.569> what<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.709> that's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
through what I know what I can do that's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.380 
through what I know what I can do that's
what<00:02:36.550> motivates<00:02:36.940> me

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
what motivates me

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.290 
what motivates me
so<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.230> truly<00:02:38.680> understand<00:02:39.250> what<00:02:39.489> makes<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
so we truly understand what makes up the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.270 
so we truly understand what makes up the
bigger<00:02:40.599> picture<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.170> what<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.739> see<00:02:41.980> as<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
bigger picture of what we see as the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.949 
bigger picture of what we see as the
laws<00:02:42.459> of<00:02:42.730> physics<00:02:42.849> there<00:02:43.390> are<00:02:43.540> things<00:02:43.810> that

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
laws of physics there are things that

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.380 
laws of physics there are things that
could<00:02:44.200> be<00:02:44.410> unimaginable<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.430> us<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.790> will

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
could be unimaginable to us that will

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.750 
could be unimaginable to us that will
definitely<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.170> commonplace<00:02:47.980> part<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.640> her
