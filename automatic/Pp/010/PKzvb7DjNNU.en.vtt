00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
guinea pig now when I adopted my guinea

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.670 
guinea pig now when I adopted my guinea
pigs<00:00:12.549> over<00:00:12.789> a<00:00:12.969> year<00:00:13.209> ago<00:00:13.360> I<00:00:13.750> thought<00:00:14.410> I<00:00:14.440> could

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
pigs over a year ago I thought I could

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.060 
pigs over a year ago I thought I could
keep<00:00:14.859> them<00:00:15.039> in<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.490> small<00:00:15.789> cage<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.949> let<00:00:17.949> them

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
keep them in a small cage and let them

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.710 
keep them in a small cage and let them
out<00:00:18.189> for<00:00:18.520> half<00:00:18.699> an<00:00:18.820> hour<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:19.090> day<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:19.539> thought

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
out for half an hour a day and I thought

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.909 
out for half an hour a day and I thought
that<00:00:19.900> they<00:00:19.990> would<00:00:20.080> be<00:00:20.140> happy<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.679> that<00:00:20.800> would

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
that they would be happy and that would

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.710 
that they would be happy and that would
be<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.369> right<00:00:21.580> amount<00:00:21.699> of<00:00:21.880> exercise<00:00:22.300> for<00:00:22.539> them

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
be the right amount of exercise for them

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.900 
be the right amount of exercise for them
now<00:00:23.230> I<00:00:23.259> noticed<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.800> when<00:00:24.220> they<00:00:24.550> would<00:00:24.699> be<00:00:24.849> in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
now I noticed that when they would be in

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.489 
now I noticed that when they would be in
the<00:00:24.999> cage<00:00:25.269> all<00:00:25.509> they<00:00:25.720> would<00:00:25.869> do<00:00:26.019> just<00:00:26.349> lay

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
the cage all they would do just lay

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.769 
the cage all they would do just lay
there<00:00:26.710> do<00:00:26.949> nothing<00:00:27.339> stare<00:00:27.669> at<00:00:27.849> me<00:00:28.029> or<00:00:28.240> chew<00:00:28.630> on

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
there do nothing stare at me or chew on

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.929 
there do nothing stare at me or chew on
the<00:00:28.960> bars<00:00:29.230> obsessively<00:00:30.009> so<00:00:30.489> I<00:00:30.550> started<00:00:30.880> to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
the bars obsessively so I started to

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.420 
the bars obsessively so I started to
realize<00:00:31.269> there<00:00:31.300> was<00:00:31.509> something<00:00:31.929> wrong<00:00:32.110> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
realize there was something wrong and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.300 
realize there was something wrong and
then<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.730> got<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.720> third<00:00:35.170> guinea<00:00:35.440> pig<00:00:35.770> and<00:00:36.040> I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
then I got a third guinea pig and I

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.819 
then I got a third guinea pig and I
realized<00:00:36.910> that<00:00:37.239> I<00:00:37.510> definitely<00:00:38.320> needed<00:00:38.620> to

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
realized that I definitely needed to

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.880 
realized that I definitely needed to
upgrade<00:00:39.100> their<00:00:40.000> housing<00:00:40.660> so<00:00:41.500> I<00:00:41.530> looked<00:00:41.770> up

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
upgrade their housing so I looked up

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.319 
upgrade their housing so I looked up
online<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.399> there<00:00:42.519> were<00:00:42.609> a<00:00:42.640> lot<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.850> different

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
online and there were a lot of different

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.880 
online and there were a lot of different
cages<00:00:43.719> that<00:00:43.750> people<00:00:44.140> built<00:00:44.410> some<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.739> them

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
cages that people built some of them

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.580 
cages that people built some of them
really<00:00:45.399> awesome<00:00:45.879> so<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:46.870> really<00:00:47.140> thought<00:00:47.320> about

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
really awesome so I really thought about

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.180 
really awesome so I really thought about
it<00:00:47.800> but<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.699> didn't<00:00:49.420> really<00:00:49.510> have<00:00:49.629> room<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.890> set

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
it but I didn't really have room to set

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.700 
it but I didn't really have room to set
up<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.519> separate<00:00:52.269> cage<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.840> decided<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.410> work

it<00:02:12.200> only<00:02:12.350> takes<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.920> guess<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.550> most<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.970> would

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it only takes I guess the most I would

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.170 
it only takes I guess the most I would
say<00:02:14.240> 15<00:02:14.630> minutes<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:15.140> finish<00:02:15.290> everything<00:02:15.680> I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
say 15 minutes to finish everything I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.220 
say 15 minutes to finish everything I
try<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.240> keep<00:02:17.360> things<00:02:17.600> simple<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.080> that's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
try to keep things simple and that's

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.800 
try to keep things simple and that's
what<00:02:18.440> makes<00:02:18.980> cleaning<00:02:19.370> time<00:02:19.700> really<00:02:20.180> quick<00:02:20.390> as

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
what makes cleaning time really quick as

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.000
