00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
thing that you have is the body color so

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.020 
thing that you have is the body color so
let's<00:02:40.710> say<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> wanted<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.460> make<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.760> body

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
let's say I wanted to make this body

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.200 
let's say I wanted to make this body
color<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:43.320> know<00:02:43.440> more<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.310> gray<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:45.030> come

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
color you know more of a gray I can come

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.720 
color you know more of a gray I can come
in<00:02:45.240> here<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.570> make<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.470> gray<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.550> going

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
in here and make it gray and it's going

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.240 
in here and make it gray and it's going
to<00:02:47.790> change<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.360> body<00:02:48.690> color<00:02:49.050> right<00:02:49.290> here<00:02:49.320> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
to change this body color right here to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.520 
to change this body color right here to
a<00:02:50.280> gray<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.480> obviously<00:02:51.990> I'd<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.380> come

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
a gray and so obviously I'd have to come

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
a gray and so obviously I'd have to come
in<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.830> fine<00:02:53.220> tune<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.880> other<00:02:54.030> areas<00:02:54.120> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
in and fine tune in the other areas and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.540 
in and fine tune in the other areas and
change<00:02:54.840> these<00:02:55.140> colors<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.340> what<00:02:56.520> I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
change these colors to to be what I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.650 
change these colors to to be what I
wanted<00:02:56.820> them<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.240> but<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.630> how

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
wanted them to be but you can see how

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.240 
wanted them to be but you can see how
quickly<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.140> could<00:02:58.260> change<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.830> color<00:02:59.160> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250

I'm going to turn this back to white and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.770 
I'm going to turn this back to white and
I'm<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.340> go<00:03:08.460> ahead<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.820> change<00:03:09.450> the

I'm going to go ahead and change the
drop<00:03:10.140> shadow<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.240> the

drop shadow so this is the this is the
body<00:03:13.140> shadow<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.400> going<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.550> be

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
body shadow with so this is going to be

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.580 
body shadow with so this is going to be
how<00:03:14.700> thick<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.210> drop<00:03:15.480> shadow<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.440> is

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
how thick the drop shadow is and this is

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.230 
how thick the drop shadow is and this is
going<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.800> be<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.190> opacity<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.940> I'm<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.210> to

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
going to be the opacity so I'm going to

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820 
going to be the opacity so I'm going to
turn<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.480> opacity<00:03:18.720> all<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.110> way<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.470> I'm

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
turn the opacity all the way up and I'm

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.230 
turn the opacity all the way up and I'm
going<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.010> turn<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.250> drop<00:03:20.640> shadow<00:03:20.910> all<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
going to turn the drop shadow all the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640 
going to turn the drop shadow all the
way<00:03:21.330> up<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.600> I'm<00:03:21.780> going<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.930> click<00:03:22.110> Save<00:03:22.350> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
way up and I'm going to click Save and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.530 
way up and I'm going to click Save and
you're<00:03:23.340> going<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.490> see<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.210> drop

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
you're going to see that this drop

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.080 
you're going to see that this drop
shadow<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:25.200> becomes<00:03:25.890> darker<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.700> larger

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
shadow here becomes darker and larger

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.350 
shadow here becomes darker and larger
and<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:27.990> there<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.800> have<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.060> drop<00:03:30.060> shadow

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
and so there you have the drop shadow

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.050 
and so there you have the drop shadow
but<00:03:30.600> let's<00:03:31.200> say<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.350> didn't<00:03:31.800> want<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:32.400> this

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
but let's say I didn't want this this

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.570 
but let's say I didn't want this this
body<00:03:33.420> at<00:03:33.750> all<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.140> didn't<00:03:34.380> want<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.220> wanted

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
body at all I didn't want one I wanted

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.160 
body at all I didn't want one I wanted
to<00:03:35.640> see<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.940> gone<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.630> come<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.810> here<00:03:36.900> and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
to see it gone so I can come in here and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.530 
to see it gone so I can come in here and
I<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.220> turn<00:03:38.400> off<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.820> drop<00:03:39.030> shadow<00:03:39.300> just

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
I can turn off the drop shadow just

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.630 
I can turn off the drop shadow just
knock<00:03:39.960> both<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.380> these<00:03:40.590> items<00:03:40.890> down<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.400> zero

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
knock both of these items down to zero

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.700 
knock both of these items down to zero
and<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.300> could<00:03:42.480> make<00:03:42.690> body<00:03:42.990> transparent<00:03:43.650> by

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
and I could make body transparent by

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.580 
and I could make body transparent by
clicking<00:03:44.040> true<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.460> when<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.090> click<00:03:45.210> Save<00:03:45.660> I'm

clicking true and when I click Save I'm

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.170 
clicking true and when I click Save I'm
going<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.770> come<00:03:46.890> back<00:03:47.010> here<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.520> refresh<00:03:47.700> it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180

and you're going to see that the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.590 
and you're going to see that the
background<00:03:49.950> will<00:03:50.460> now<00:03:50.580> show<00:03:50.970> through<00:03:51.300> because

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
background will now show through because

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.750 
background will now show through because
there<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.020> no<00:03:52.230> body<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.250> background<00:03:53.640> now

so<00:04:21.960> that's<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:23.070> quick

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
so that's just a really quick

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.970 
so that's just a really quick
understanding<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.970> how<00:04:24.120> quickly<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.750> can

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
understanding of how quickly you can

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.450 
understanding of how quickly you can
modify<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.550> branding<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
modify the the branding of this and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.129
