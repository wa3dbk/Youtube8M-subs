00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.930 
the fight has just started and I've run
over<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.650> other<00:04:29.830> team<00:04:30.100> side<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.730> Tom

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
and I've disengaged catching all of them

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.370 
and I've disengaged catching all of them
in<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.250> web<00:04:33.460> now<00:04:34.180> you're<00:04:34.450> gone<00:04:34.720> see<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.170> also

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
in a web now you're gone see that I also

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.110 
in a web now you're gone see that I also
scattered<00:04:35.740> appalling<00:04:36.280> before<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.610> drop<00:04:37.000> him

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
scattered appalling before I drop him

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.420 
scattered appalling before I drop him
even<00:04:37.570> talk<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.960> wet<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.920> reason<00:04:39.220> for<00:04:39.250> that

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
even talk is wet and the reason for that

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.030 
even talk is wet and the reason for that
is<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.910> if<00:04:40.300> he's<00:04:40.870> fast<00:04:41.140> enough<00:04:41.410> he<00:04:41.620> can<00:04:41.650> cast

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
is that if he's fast enough he can cast

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:53.210 
is that if he's fast enough he can cast
freedom<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.520> himself<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.120> run<00:04:43.330> away<00:04:43.540> from<00:04:43.600> it
