when we peel it you will see that the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.760 
when we peel it you will see that the
banana<00:00:38.110> is<00:00:38.379> indeed<00:00:38.970> sliced<00:00:41.100> into<00:00:42.100> pieces<00:00:43.770> this

need of course a banana and the older
banana<00:01:02.770> works<00:01:03.070> better<00:01:03.309> because<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:03.790> already

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
banana works better because it already

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.760 
banana works better because it already
has<00:01:04.210> spots<00:01:04.570> on<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.259> may<00:01:05.409> not<00:01:05.500> know<00:01:05.649> what

pieces of thread and don't knot the ends

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.109 
pieces of thread and don't knot the ends
and<00:01:34.950> you'll<00:01:35.950> notice<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.340> banana<00:01:36.670> has<00:01:36.909> these

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
and you'll notice a banana has these

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:37.889 
and you'll notice a banana has these
lines<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.719> it

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
lines on it

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.899 
lines on it
I<00:01:38.109> call<00:01:38.380> them<00:01:38.529> sides<00:01:38.859> like<00:01:39.369> they<00:01:39.490> have<00:01:39.609> sides

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
I call them sides like they have sides

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.179 
I call them sides like they have sides
on<00:01:40.209> unlike<00:01:40.479> ridges<00:01:40.869> so<00:01:41.079> pick<00:01:41.829> one<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.099> the

on unlike ridges so pick one of the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.889 
on unlike ridges so pick one of the
ridges<00:01:42.549> then<00:01:42.819> they<00:01:42.999> usually<00:01:43.149> have<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:43.599> four

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
ridges then they usually have like four

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.620 
ridges then they usually have like four
or<00:01:44.079> five<00:01:44.109> sides<00:01:44.560> if<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.859> count<00:01:45.420> start<00:01:46.420> up<00:01:46.509> one

or five sides if you count start up one
of<00:01:46.749> the<00:01:46.810> ridges<00:01:47.139> stick<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.979> deal<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.490> just

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
of the ridges stick the deal in and just

go<00:01:48.759> under<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.569> skin<00:01:49.959> just<00:01:50.439> under<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.919> skin

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
go under the skin just under the skin

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.379 
go under the skin just under the skin
and<00:01:51.459> come<00:01:52.450> up<00:01:52.630> through<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:53.049> banana<00:01:53.639> at<00:01:54.639> the

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
and come up through the banana at the

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:00.109 
and come up through the banana at the
next<00:01:55.719> Ridge<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:58.139> pull<00:01:59.139> the<00:01:59.319> thread<00:01:59.499> through

next Ridge and pull the thread through

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.330 
next Ridge and pull the thread through
but<00:02:01.119> not<00:02:01.270> all<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> way<00:02:01.779> leave<00:02:02.529> to<00:02:03.099> three

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
see that first thread but you don't want

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
go right next to it then just under the

pull the thread and it's going to look

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.570 
pull the thread and it's going to look
like<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.110> little<00:02:30.290> stitch<00:02:30.650> you're<00:02:31.370> going<00:02:31.400> to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
like a little stitch you're going to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.589 
like a little stitch you're going to

get to your start point you're going to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.630 
get to your start point you're going to
try<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.959> get<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> needle<00:02:45.530> through<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> same

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
try to get the needle through the same

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.069 
try to get the needle through the same
hole<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:49.730> under<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.330> banana<00:02:50.630> skin<00:02:51.019> and

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
hole just under the banana skin and

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.650 
hole just under the banana skin and
there<00:02:54.079> you<00:02:54.260> go<00:02:54.410> up<00:02:54.650> through<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.099> same<00:02:55.310> hole<00:02:55.660> or

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
there you go up through the same hole or

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.020 
there you go up through the same hole or
as<00:02:56.959> close<00:02:57.079> as<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.849> pull<00:02:58.849> it

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
as close as you can to it pull it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.750 
as close as you can to it pull it
through<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:01.220> you're<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.519> take<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
through then you're going to take the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.059 
through then you're going to take the
needle<00:03:01.910> off<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.450> thread<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.049> then<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.829> give

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
needle off the thread and then just give

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.869 
needle off the thread and then just give
it<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.280> tug<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:05.560> you'll<00:03:06.560> feel<00:03:06.920> thread<00:03:07.400> popping

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
it a tug and you'll feel thread popping

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.030 
it a tug and you'll feel thread popping
as<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.269> cuts<00:03:09.140> through<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.500> skin<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
as it cuts through the skin of the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.229 
as it cuts through the skin of the
banana<00:03:10.340> where<00:03:10.640> all<00:03:10.730> those<00:03:10.849> little<00:03:11.090> stitches

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
banana where all those little stitches

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.140 
banana where all those little stitches
are<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:12.620> pull<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:12.950> out<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.340> if<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.030> do

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
are and then pull it out and if you do

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.039 
are and then pull it out and if you do
this<00:03:14.329> several<00:03:14.629> times<00:03:15.069> along<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.280> banana<00:03:17.049> you

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
this several times along the banana you

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.940 
this several times along the banana you
get<00:03:18.290> multiple<00:03:18.769> slices<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.560> said<00:03:21.799> you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
get multiple slices like I said you

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.550 
get multiple slices like I said you
won't<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:22.609> see<00:03:22.850> those<00:03:23.030> little<00:03:23.299> marks<00:03:23.660> but

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
won't you can see those little marks but

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.080 
won't you can see those little marks but
if<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.799> banana<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> little<00:03:25.519> bit<00:03:25.609> older<00:03:25.940> it

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
if the banana is a little bit older it

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.430 
if the banana is a little bit older it
probably<00:03:26.480> going<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.660> have<00:03:26.750> lots<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.049> marks<00:03:27.319> on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
probably going to have lots of marks on

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.330 
probably going to have lots of marks on
it<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> begin<00:03:27.799> with

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
it to begin with

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.729 
it to begin with
and<00:03:28.540> someone<00:03:29.540> who<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.079> looking<00:03:30.319> at<00:03:30.590> it

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
and someone who is just looking at it

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.020 
and someone who is just looking at it
probably<00:03:30.889> wouldn't<00:03:31.310> notice<00:03:31.430> unless<00:03:31.850> they

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
probably wouldn't notice unless they

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.300 
probably wouldn't notice unless they
look<00:03:32.180> very<00:03:32.209> very<00:03:32.630> closely<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.010> slice

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
look very very closely and you can slice

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.009 
look very very closely and you can slice
the<00:03:34.459> entire<00:03:34.730> banana<00:03:34.940> out<00:03:35.209> this<00:03:35.450> way<00:03:35.690> or<00:03:35.959> just

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
the entire banana out this way or just

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.460 
the entire banana out this way or just
one<00:03:36.889> or<00:03:36.920> two<00:03:37.130> slices<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.730> did<00:03:38.000> here<00:03:38.470> there

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
one or two slices like I did here there

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.349 
one or two slices like I did here there
