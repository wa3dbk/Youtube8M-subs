00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
writing 20 hours a day and that's all

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.889 
writing 20 hours a day and that's all
you<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:38.760> you're<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.239> experiencing

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you do you don't you're not experiencing

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
you do you don't you're not experiencing
any<00:00:39.930> life<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.680> you're<00:00:41.070> probably<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.430> gonna

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
any life and you're probably not gonna

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
any life and you're probably not gonna
have<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> job<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> place<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.510> live<00:00:42.719> you'd<00:00:43.200> be

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
have a job or a place to live you'd be

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.510 
have a job or a place to live you'd be
completely<00:00:43.440> broke<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.070> you're<00:00:44.309> writing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
completely broke because you're writing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
completely broke because you're writing
all<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> time<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.500> too

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
all the time so I think it can be too

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.600 
all the time so I think it can be too
bad<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.879> takes<00:00:48.440> too<00:00:49.440> much<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> takes

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
bad if it takes too much time and takes

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.010 
bad if it takes too much time and takes
away<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> living<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> then

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
away from actually a living and then

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
away from actually a living and then
also<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.280> obsession<00:00:53.940> where

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
also if it's like an obsession where

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.689 
also if it's like an obsession where
every<00:00:54.510> few<00:00:54.690> hours<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> write<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
every few hours you have to write or you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.439 
every few hours you have to write or you
can't<00:00:56.940> deal<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can't deal with it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.910 
can't deal with it
you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.930> same<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.260> anything<00:00:58.440> else<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you know same with anything else if you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.840

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
hours and you can't deal otherwise

would<00:05:09.840> kind<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.170> generally<00:05:10.890> wouldn't<00:05:11.130> be<00:05:11.190> bad

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
would kind of generally wouldn't be bad

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.640 
would kind of generally wouldn't be bad
and<00:05:11.780> as<00:05:12.780> far<00:05:12.930> as<00:05:12.990> too<00:05:13.170> much<00:05:13.260> journaling<00:05:13.620> I

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
and as far as too much journaling I

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.140 
and as far as too much journaling I
think<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.280> kind<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.460> depends<00:05:14.790> if<00:05:15.000> it's

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
think that kind of depends if it's

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.120 
think that kind of depends if it's
summer<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.320> don't<00:05:16.470> have<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.650> study<00:05:16.860> or

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
summer and you don't have to study or

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.830 
summer and you don't have to study or
work<00:05:17.160> or<00:05:17.490> whatever<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:18.480> know<00:05:18.570> you<00:05:18.660> could

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
work or whatever you know you could

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.800 
work or whatever you know you could
spend<00:05:18.990> five<00:05:19.230> hours<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.530> day<00:05:20.030> writing<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.360> doing

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
spend five hours a day writing and doing

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.380 
spend five hours a day writing and doing
art<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.080> stuff<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.470> not<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:23.160> know<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.460> not

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
art and stuff and not you know and not

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.840 
art and stuff and not you know and not
that<00:05:24.720> not<00:05:25.050> hinder<00:05:25.950> your<00:05:26.040> life<00:05:26.220> necessarily

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
that not hinder your life necessarily

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.940 
that not hinder your life necessarily
but<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:28.020> know<00:05:28.110> if<00:05:28.170> you<00:05:28.230> have<00:05:28.320> a<00:05:28.350> job<00:05:28.560> or<00:05:28.830> you're

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
but you know if you have a job or you're

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.070 
but you know if you have a job or you're
in<00:05:29.040> school<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:29.340> you're<00:05:29.750> taking<00:05:30.750> up<00:05:30.840> most<00:05:30.930> of

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
in school and you're taking up most of

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.720 
in school and you're taking up most of
your<00:05:31.140> day<00:05:31.290> writing<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:32.070> that's<00:05:32.370> not<00:05:32.520> your<00:05:32.700> job

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
your day writing and that's not your job

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.910 
your day writing and that's not your job
then<00:05:33.300> you're<00:05:33.420> probably<00:05:33.930> gonna<00:05:34.290> be<00:05:34.500> broke<00:05:34.770> and

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
then you're probably gonna be broke and

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.110 
then you're probably gonna be broke and
starving<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.430> not<00:05:35.520> feel<00:05:35.670> like<00:05:35.700> journaling

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
starving and not feel like journaling

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.320 
starving and not feel like journaling
either<00:05:36.270> so<00:05:37.260> yeah<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.650> think<00:05:38.100> you<00:05:38.820> know<00:05:38.940> anything

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
either so yeah I think you know anything

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.480 
either so yeah I think you know anything
could<00:05:39.419> be<00:05:39.480> an<00:05:39.570> abscessed<00:05:39.900> obsession<00:05:40.740> whether

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
could be an abscessed obsession whether

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.980 
could be an abscessed obsession whether
it's<00:05:41.580> waking<00:05:41.850> up<00:05:41.940> every<00:05:42.270> few<00:05:42.419> hours<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:42.870> write

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
it's waking up every few hours to write

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.330 
it's waking up every few hours to write
about<00:05:43.140> your<00:05:43.350> dreams<00:05:43.590> that's<00:05:43.830> not<00:05:43.980> healthy

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
about your dreams that's not healthy

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.310 
about your dreams that's not healthy
it's<00:05:44.910> same<00:05:45.090> thing<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:45.360> like<00:05:45.390> apples<00:05:45.870> apples

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
it's same thing with like apples apples

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.930 
it's same thing with like apples apples
are<00:05:46.410> good<00:05:46.560> but<00:05:46.740> if<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.890> do<00:05:47.040> if<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.460> eat<00:05:47.730> just

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
are good but if you do if you eat just

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.370 
are good but if you do if you eat just
apples<00:05:48.360> or<00:05:48.540> you<00:05:48.600> eat<00:05:48.660> apples<00:05:48.990> like<00:05:49.110> ten<00:05:49.290> hours

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
apples or you eat apples like ten hours

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.909 
apples or you eat apples like ten hours
a<00:05:49.500> day

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
a day

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.680 
a day
you<00:05:50.850> know<00:05:50.940> that's<00:05:51.120> not<00:05:51.210> gonna<00:05:51.330> be<00:05:51.450> healthy

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
you know that's not gonna be healthy

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.300 
you know that's not gonna be healthy
just<00:05:51.870> like<00:05:51.930> journaling<00:05:52.860> ten<00:05:53.070> hours<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.280> day

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
just like journaling ten hours a day

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.440 
just like journaling ten hours a day
would<00:05:53.460> probably<00:05:53.730> be<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.850> little<00:05:53.910> bit<00:05:54.060> much<00:05:54.270> if

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
would probably be a little bit much if

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.120 
would probably be a little bit much if
that<00:05:54.600> was<00:05:54.750> every<00:05:55.530> single<00:05:55.560> day<00:05:55.830> you're<00:05:55.919> like
