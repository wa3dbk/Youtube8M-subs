this<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.809> pop<00:00:52.289> culture<00:00:52.770> by<00:00:52.920> itself<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this is pop culture by itself because I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
this is pop culture by itself because I
know<00:00:53.820> y'all<00:00:54.149> used<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> me<00:00:54.719> weren't<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.350> very
