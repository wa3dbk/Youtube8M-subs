00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that's what I want and some of his teeth

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.170 
that's what I want and some of his teeth
were<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.190> darker<00:01:53.610> than<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.820> obviously

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
were a little darker than that obviously

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060 
were a little darker than that obviously
the<00:01:54.660> right-lateral<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.470> significantly

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the right-lateral was significantly

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.610 
the right-lateral was significantly
lighter<00:01:56.430> than<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:56.970> now<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.020> honest<00:01:58.470> I

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
lighter than that now to be honest I

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.550 
lighter than that now to be honest I
wasn't<00:01:59.100> positive<00:01:59.370> a<00:01:59.940> 3.5<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.200> he<00:02:01.380> would

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
wasn't positive a 3.5 is what he would

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.040 
wasn't positive a 3.5 is what he would
want<00:02:01.590> he<00:02:02.580> also<00:02:02.730> didn't<00:02:03.240> want<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.660> straight

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
want he also didn't want them straight

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.260 
want he also didn't want them straight
he<00:02:04.350> wanted<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.159> slightly<00:02:05.460> mal<00:02:05.820> aligned

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
he wanted them to slightly mal aligned

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.529 
he wanted them to slightly mal aligned
and<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.890> malalignment<00:02:08.399> was<00:02:08.879> no<00:02:09.060> problem

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and so the malalignment was no problem

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.479 
and so the malalignment was no problem
we<00:02:09.629> had<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> diagnostic<00:02:10.440> wax<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.950> done<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
we had a diagnostic wax up done that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.940 
we had a diagnostic wax up done that
left<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> teeth<00:02:12.150> slightly<00:02:12.330> mal<00:02:12.870> aligned<00:02:13.260> but

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
left the teeth slightly mal aligned but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.920 
left the teeth slightly mal aligned but
I<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.280> made<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.150> temporary<00:02:15.659> out<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
I actually made the temporary out of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.010 
I actually made the temporary out of
shade<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.670> temporary<00:02:17.670> material<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.750> he

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
shade a to temporary material so he

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.870 
shade a to temporary material so he
could<00:02:19.290> see

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
could see

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.250 
could see
what<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.300> would<00:02:20.450> look<00:02:20.600> like<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:21.050> they<00:02:21.080> were

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
what it would look like if they were

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.160 
what it would look like if they were
lighter<00:02:21.710> in<00:02:22.040> shade<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:23.090> honestly<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.660> knew<00:02:23.930> a2

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
lighter in shade now honestly I knew a2

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.500 
lighter in shade now honestly I knew a2
would<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.770> too<00:02:25.040> bright<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.910> knew<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.210> could

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
would be too bright but I knew I could

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.770 
would be too bright but I knew I could
also<00:02:26.840> stain<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.380> down<00:02:27.590> fairly<00:02:27.980> easily<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.240> if

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
also stain it down fairly easily and if

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.650 
also stain it down fairly easily and if
I<00:02:29.960> made<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.260> out<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> a3<00:02:31.580> temporary<00:02:32.150> material

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
I made it out of a3 temporary material

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.840 
I made it out of a3 temporary material
often<00:02:32.960> those<00:02:33.620> are<00:02:33.800> not<00:02:33.950> very<00:02:34.220> pretty<00:02:34.430> looking

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
often those are not very pretty looking

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.000 
often those are not very pretty looking

temporary<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.470> literally<00:03:40.190> by<00:03:40.460> holding<00:03:40.940> up<00:03:41.120> an

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
temporary and literally by holding up an

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.360 
temporary and literally by holding up an
a<00:03:41.540> 3.5<00:03:42.410> shade<00:03:42.800> tab

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
a 3.5 shade tab

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.730 
a 3.5 shade tab
I<00:03:43.400> could<00:03:44.030> stain<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.720> temporary<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.380> literally

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
I could stain the temporary to literally

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.630 
I could stain the temporary to literally
match<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.550> 3.5<00:03:47.510> tab<00:03:47.920> now<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:48.950> can<00:03:49.370> try<00:03:49.610> that

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
match that a 3.5 tab now I can try that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.170 
match that a 3.5 tab now I can try that
back<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.480> see<00:03:51.140> if<00:03:51.230> he<00:03:51.380> likes<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.890> or<00:03:52.010> not<00:03:52.040> if<00:03:52.940> he

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
back in see if he likes it or not if he

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.290 
back in see if he likes it or not if he
likes<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:53.930> photograph<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.860> shade<00:03:55.459> tab<00:03:55.820> next

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
likes it I photograph the shade tab next

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.480 
likes it I photograph the shade tab next
to<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> temporary<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.290> that's<00:03:57.800> what<00:03:58.040> goes<00:03:58.220> to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
to the temporary and that's what goes to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.970 
to the temporary and that's what goes to
the<00:03:58.520> lab<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:59.060> our<00:03:59.180> shade<00:03:59.420> photograph<00:04:00.020> here<00:04:00.830> is

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
the lab is our shade photograph here is

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.570 
the lab is our shade photograph here is
the<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.670> 3.5<00:04:02.600> temporary<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.260> his<00:04:03.380> mouth<00:04:03.620> in

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the a 3.5 temporary in his mouth in

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.580 
the a 3.5 temporary in his mouth in
reality<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.300> doesn't<00:04:05.330> look<00:04:05.840> too<00:04:06.020> dark<00:04:06.230> at<00:04:06.470> all

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
reality it doesn't look too dark at all

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.650 
reality it doesn't look too dark at all
because<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.670> shade<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.090> his<00:04:08.120> lower<00:04:08.450> in

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
because of the shade of his lower in

because of the shade of his lower in
tears<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.290> shade<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.620> his<00:04:09.680> cuspid<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.400> in

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
tears in the shade of his cuspid and in

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.060 
tears in the shade of his cuspid and in
fact<00:04:10.820> he<00:04:11.060> loved<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.770> a<00:04:12.800> case

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
fact he loved it and so this is a case

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.220 
fact he loved it and so this is a case
where<00:04:13.310> staining<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> temporary<00:04:14.480> was<00:04:14.660> really

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
where staining the temporary was really

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.470 
where staining the temporary was really
a<00:04:15.260> helpful<00:04:15.590> tool<00:04:16.160> not<00:04:16.790> just<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:17.180> make<00:04:17.330> him

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
a helpful tool not just to make him

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.270 
a helpful tool not just to make him
happy<00:04:17.750> while<00:04:18.140> he's<00:04:18.290> wearing<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.709> temporary

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
happy while he's wearing the temporary

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
the temporary to the lab they can make a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.589 
the temporary to the lab they can make a
very<00:04:35.560> simple<00:04:36.009> putty<00:04:36.580> matrix<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.419> that

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
very simple putty matrix of that

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.959 
very simple putty matrix of that
temporary<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.379> it'll<00:04:38.949> tell<00:04:39.129> you<00:04:39.280> exactly

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
temporary and it'll tell you exactly

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.029 
temporary and it'll tell you exactly
where<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.449> incisal<00:04:40.810> edges<00:04:41.199> should<00:04:41.560> go<00:04:41.800> of

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
where the incisal edges should go of

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.580 
where the incisal edges should go of
those<00:04:42.310> final<00:04:42.699> restorations<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.960> replicate

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
those final restorations to replicate

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.279 
those final restorations to replicate
the<00:04:44.800> form<00:04:45.039> of<00:04:45.219> the<00:04:45.340> temporary<00:04:45.849> and<00:04:46.289> that's

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
the form of the temporary and that's

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.929 
the form of the temporary and that's
what<00:04:47.469> he<00:04:47.560> looked<00:04:47.770> like<00:04:47.830> pretreatment<00:04:48.729> and

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
what he looked like pretreatment and

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.990 
what he looked like pretreatment and
again<00:04:49.330> his<00:04:49.569> goal<00:04:50.340> not<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.580> have<00:04:51.699> teeth<00:04:51.969> that

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
again his goal not to have teeth that

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.089 
again his goal not to have teeth that
were<00:04:52.360> too<00:04:52.569> nice-looking<00:04:53.289> not<00:04:53.469> too<00:04:53.740> straight

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
were too nice-looking not too straight

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.459 
were too nice-looking not too straight
not<00:04:54.370> too<00:04:54.610> white<00:04:54.879> but<00:04:55.479> much<00:04:55.750> better<00:04:56.020> than<00:04:56.289> what

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
not too white but much better than what

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.260 
not too white but much better than what
he<00:04:56.560> had<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.069> he<00:04:57.129> was<00:04:57.159> very<00:04:57.430> pleased<00:04:57.849> with<00:04:58.090> the

final<00:04:58.629> result

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
final result

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.589

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
doing it here's a video of how we stain

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.719 
doing it here's a video of how we stain
we've<00:05:04.569> got<00:05:04.779> our<00:05:04.900> orange<00:05:05.169> stain<00:05:05.710> powder<00:05:06.400> and

we've got our orange stain powder and
our<00:05:06.789> blue<00:05:07.090> we<00:05:07.659> put<00:05:07.870> some<00:05:08.080> clear<00:05:08.439> pala<00:05:08.710> seal<00:05:09.039> in

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
our blue we put some clear pala seal in

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.999 
our blue we put some clear pala seal in
one<00:05:09.460> dish<00:05:09.729> we<00:05:10.689> mix<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.199> orange<00:05:11.560> with<00:05:11.770> pala

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
one dish we mix the orange with pala

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.850 
one dish we mix the orange with pala
seal<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.969> orange<00:05:13.539> will<00:05:13.990> go<00:05:14.139> on<00:05:14.289> cervical<00:05:14.800> e

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
seal the orange will go on cervical e

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.800 
seal the orange will go on cervical e
but<00:05:15.069> before<00:05:15.400> we<00:05:15.520> do<00:05:15.669> that<00:05:15.699> we<00:05:16.000> Arab<00:05:16.419> raid<00:05:16.629> the

whole<00:05:17.020> temporary<00:05:17.590> with<00:05:17.860> aluminum<00:05:18.310> oxide<00:05:18.759> and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
whole temporary with aluminum oxide and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.350 
whole temporary with aluminum oxide and
then<00:05:20.080> once<00:05:20.469> we<00:05:20.680> put<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.889> clear<00:05:20.949> coat<00:05:21.639> on<00:05:21.669> every

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.029 
on everything now I take my orange and I
color<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.449> cervical<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.289> I<00:05:29.349> color<00:05:29.650> up<00:05:29.860> the

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
color the cervical and I color up the

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:30.899 
color the cervical and I color up the
interproximal

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
interproximal

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.570 
interproximal
so<00:05:31.689> it<00:05:31.840> defines<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.560> temporary<00:05:33.129> more<00:05:33.370> because

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
so it defines the temporary more because

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.320 
so it defines the temporary more because
it<00:05:33.729> gives<00:05:33.939> us<00:05:34.029> some<00:05:34.240> interproximal<00:05:34.960> color<00:05:35.219> and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
it gives us some interproximal color and

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.390 
it gives us some interproximal color and
then<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:37.479> go<00:05:37.629> to<00:05:37.690> blue<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.650> blue<00:05:38.919> starts

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
then we go to blue and the blue starts

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.510 
then we go to blue and the blue starts
to<00:05:39.550> intensify<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.419> look<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.469> translucency<00:05:42.400> in

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
to intensify the look of translucency in

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.189 
to intensify the look of translucency in
the<00:05:42.639> incisal<00:05:42.969> so<00:05:43.389> we<00:05:43.479> just<00:05:43.659> put<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.900> up<00:05:44.020> the

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
the incisal so we just put it up the

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.110 
the incisal so we just put it up the
interproximal<00:05:44.650> x'<00:05:45.069> and<00:05:45.250> across<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.789> incisal

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
interproximal x' and across the incisal

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.869 
interproximal x' and across the incisal
edge<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:46.800> then<00:05:47.800> we<00:05:47.979> come<00:05:48.190> over<00:05:48.219> all<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:48.849> that

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
edge and then we come over all of that

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.959 
edge and then we come over all of that
with<00:05:49.389> clear<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:50.589> it's<00:05:50.800> one<00:05:51.069> layer<00:05:51.310> of<00:05:51.550> clear

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
with clear so it's one layer of clear

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.990 
with clear so it's one layer of clear
followed<00:05:52.870> by<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.080> colored<00:05:53.529> layers<00:05:53.800> cure<00:05:54.789> it

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
followed by the colored layers cure it

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.360 
followed by the colored layers cure it
another<00:05:55.659> layer<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:56.139> clear<00:05:56.469> and<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:57.039> like<00:05:57.219> to

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
another layer of clear and I like to

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.219 
another layer of clear and I like to
actually<00:05:57.520> cure<00:05:57.969> it<00:05:58.089> for<00:05:58.150> several<00:05:58.659> minutes<00:05:58.900> in

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
actually cure it for several minutes in

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.890 
actually cure it for several minutes in
an<00:05:59.349> oven<00:05:59.560> I<00:05:59.919> use<00:06:00.069> a<00:06:00.099> triad<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.759> and<00:06:01.150> there's

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
an oven I use a triad of and there's

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.779 
an oven I use a triad of and there's
many<00:06:02.259> other<00:06:02.469> ovens<00:06:02.889> on<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.129> market<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:03.669> use

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
many other ovens on the market that use

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.659 
many other ovens on the market that use
halogen<00:06:04.389> lights<00:06:04.740> one<00:06:05.740> or<00:06:05.860> two<00:06:06.039> of<00:06:06.250> them<00:06:06.460> and

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
halogen lights one or two of them and

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.649 
halogen lights one or two of them and
you<00:06:06.729> end<00:06:07.449> up<00:06:08.069> with<00:06:09.069> a<00:06:09.099> very<00:06:09.610> nice<00:06:09.879> surface<00:06:10.270> now

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
you end up with a very nice surface now

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.670 
you end up with a very nice surface now
I<00:06:10.689> do<00:06:11.699> polish<00:06:12.699> it<00:06:12.939> with<00:06:13.150> pumice<00:06:13.810> and<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.500> have<00:06:14.589> a

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
I do polish it with pumice and I have a

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.279 
I do polish it with pumice and I have a
polishing<00:06:15.219> paste<00:06:15.520> because<00:06:16.029> to<00:06:16.210> me<00:06:16.389> pala<00:06:16.960> seal

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
polishing paste because to me pala seal

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.129 
polishing paste because to me pala seal
is<00:06:17.529> too<00:06:18.039> shiny<00:06:18.400> it<00:06:19.120> also<00:06:19.300> has<00:06:19.689> kind<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.990> an

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
is too shiny it also has kind of an

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.700 
is too shiny it also has kind of an
oxygen<00:06:20.620> inhibited<00:06:21.460> layer<00:06:21.669> on<00:06:21.909> it<00:06:21.939> so<00:06:22.659> I<00:06:22.990> polish

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
oxygen inhibited layer on it so I polish

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.499 
oxygen inhibited layer on it so I polish
it<00:06:23.889> and<00:06:24.039> this<00:06:24.219> is<00:06:24.430> what<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:24.699> looks<00:06:24.909> like<00:06:25.000> after

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
it and this is what it looks like after

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.059 
it and this is what it looks like after
you've<00:06:25.629> polished<00:06:25.870> it<00:06:26.199> you<00:06:26.289> can<00:06:26.439> see<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.770> color

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
you've polished it you can see the color

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.519 
you've polished it you can see the color
interproximally<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:28.509> can<00:06:28.659> see<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.110> blue

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
interproximally you can see the blue

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.660 
interproximally you can see the blue
it's<00:06:29.860> not<00:06:29.949> overly<00:06:30.520> done<00:06:30.849> in<00:06:31.029> this<00:06:31.180> case

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
it's not overly done in this case

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.820 
it's not overly done in this case
but<00:06:32.150> that's<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.480> simple<00:06:32.840> example<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.530> how<00:06:33.590> we

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
but that's a simple example of how we

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.670 
but that's a simple example of how we
stay<00:06:34.400> in<00:06:34.460> temporaries<00:06:35.240> and<00:06:35.470> for<00:06:36.470> a<00:06:36.500> lot<00:06:36.650> of

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
stay in temporaries and for a lot of

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.400 
stay in temporaries and for a lot of
cosmetic<00:06:36.920> cases<00:06:37.490> it's<00:06:37.970> not<00:06:38.210> done<00:06:38.540> but<00:06:39.140> for<00:06:39.350> a

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
cosmetic cases it's not done but for a

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.020 
cosmetic cases it's not done but for a
lot<00:06:39.620> of<00:06:39.650> patients<00:06:39.890> who<00:06:40.220> are<00:06:40.340> really<00:06:40.670> looking

lot of patients who are really looking

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.540 
lot of patients who are really looking
to<00:06:41.270> get<00:06:41.480> natural-looking<00:06:42.290> teeth<00:06:42.800> I<00:06:43.010> find

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
to get natural-looking teeth I find

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.360 
to get natural-looking teeth I find
staining<00:06:44.150> a<00:06:44.210> very<00:06:44.510> helpful<00:06:45.050> tool<00:06:45.320> to<00:06:45.620> test

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
staining a very helpful tool to test

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.430 
staining a very helpful tool to test
drive<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:47.000> color<00:06:47.270> before<00:06:47.570> I<00:06:47.810> have<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.230> lab

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.240 
the lab bench but in the next segment
we'll<00:07:02.900> talk<00:07:03.080> about<00:07:03.230> what<00:07:03.560> happens<00:07:03.980> if<00:07:04.130> you
