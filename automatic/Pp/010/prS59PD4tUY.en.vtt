00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.339
 But wait forever, let's do magic 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.489
 Because it is a year-end party season 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.900
 I will chat from now on 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.430
 It is a title called find rx1 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.489
 5760 of this year 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.489
 I do not mind finding the way of Ek 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.529
 Well, think about the implementation procedure a long time ago and compose by yourself 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.220
 There is also 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.960
 An act of nothing 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.360
 There are a lot of facts, but also that basic 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 Can not 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.110
 Please take a look 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.740
 Yes 3 cards will also be 3 days a day show us now 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.350
 It is Furukawa too, but red feathers are waiting for 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.490
 It is 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.750
 Two men and women but two men and two ninjas in the middle 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.540
 Is 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.090
 I watched this 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.270
 It is Miyoshi 71 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 I write it on two black sheets, and I'm going to go as it is. 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.750
 Because Tosama is complete, this in the middle is a matter of course 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 Right 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.740
 This time 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 However, in Fuuchi, it is worth 14,000 yen. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 you know 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.110
 It changed outside the United States 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.189
 I will write my order but there are some red cards 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.660
 I will put two girls on the tortoise 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.800
 This pufferfish should be the best in the people of Hirao. 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.730
 It should be this 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.190
 However 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.490
 Kaoh eyes 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 It's a back lodge I went here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.760
 Even if it is this part, it is the name if you do not look well in all 9 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.500
 Ne 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.050
 jaa black black with two black cards stacked on this red river 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.270
 From Akamitsu 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 It is red and black once a year 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.180
 Up and down 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.240
 I have nothing to do here 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.650
 I will guide you this day 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.260
 The two remaining Boston is a Yokohama nation 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.800
 This is also possible for players who do not have a hard time 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 Right 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.550
 The front line is easy in Bali 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.689
 I think you can do stress test 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.619
 To do 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.899
 Former managing director is whether it is such a thing and it is with war 2 win 4 loss 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.189
 6 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.469
 Wear one side too 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.919
 This is a very ordinary card 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.449
 520,000 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.899
 It's soft 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:48.279
 Well, talking about songs is something else 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.629
 It is such a man and suppose that three men did an arson 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.280
 But speaking of that kind of thing, it is the first boy before 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.469
 But it is 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.569
 Suppose that you have the same card. 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.319
 I covered the good card of 2007 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.419
 After 10 days, what should I do? 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.779
 As you know if one side says three countries with goals 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.979
 Do it 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.979
 nyt is on top 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.730
 No matter what the effect is if there is only one thing about you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.579
 That's fine 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.519
 Then how are eight colors 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.730
 On the other hand 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.679
 Still I'm afraid 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.699
 I want to say eight times 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.509
 To what extent other than the ingredients 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.509
 Eighth-one knows the drums 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.079
 It's a bad word, for example you are 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.859
 It is said that we are actively going 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.919
 In addition to 8 the same man who used the same but efficient also possessed 11 arson 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.789
 Let's say we got off the road 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:52.399
 Old house was expensive 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.029
 Then I'm interested but it's a diversion 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.210
 Other than * 8 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.459
 You will lose to this one 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.569
 So the shop was a magician, but looking at it in 8 tons 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.909
 What does that mean? 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.279
 sim card 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.610
 Against 11 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.809
 I am interested to be able to win 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.219
 It is a man 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.879
 strongest 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.169
 Ace's 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.069
 Your own victory over that 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.360
 It turns out that 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.550
 Filter magician is rich and wins with Ikama 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.990
 I will go to town
