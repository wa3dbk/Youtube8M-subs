so<00:00:08.160> welcome<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.760> design<00:00:09.150> modeling

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
so welcome to this design modeling

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.660 
so welcome to this design modeling
tutorial<00:00:09.720> and<00:00:10.350> this<00:00:10.800> time<00:00:11.070> we're<00:00:11.280> going<00:00:11.430> to<00:00:11.549> be

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
tutorial and this time we're going to be

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.959 
tutorial and this time we're going to be
taking<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.120> look<00:00:12.270> at<00:00:12.480> working<00:00:13.230> with<00:00:13.260> styrofoam

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
taking a look at working with styrofoam

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.369 
taking a look at working with styrofoam
but<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> other<00:00:15.600> parts<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
but one of the other parts of this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.980 
but one of the other parts of this
tutorial<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.730> i<00:00:17.850> should<00:00:18.330> say<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.660> quite<00:00:18.840> an

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
tutorial and i should say it's quite an

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.260 
tutorial and i should say it's quite an
advanced<00:00:19.530> one<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.820> we're<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> be

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
advanced one is that we're going to be

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.570 
advanced one is that we're going to be
taking<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.720> look<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> work<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:23.070> basic

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
taking a look at how to work with basic

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.120 
taking a look at how to work with basic
electronics<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.650> cut

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
electronics like this and actually cut

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.099 
electronics like this and actually cut
up<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> printed<00:00:26.880> circuit<00:00:27.089> board<00:00:27.539> which<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
up the printed circuit board which is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.829 
up the printed circuit board which is
this<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.710> green<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.839> still

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839 
this this green bit here and still

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.050 
this this green bit here and still
retain<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.410> functionality<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.669> wireless

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
retain the functionality of the wireless

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.930 
retain the functionality of the wireless
mouse<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> also<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.700> involve

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
mouse so this is also going to involve

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.300 
mouse so this is also going to involve
taking<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> things<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> left<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
taking all the things like the left and

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.209 
taking all the things like the left and
the<00:00:38.340> right<00:00:38.400> click<00:00:38.940> switches<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the right click switches here and the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.630 
the right click switches here and the
jog<00:00:41.489> wheel<00:00:41.539> which<00:00:42.539> is<00:00:42.570> usually<00:00:43.050> operated<00:00:43.440> by

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
jog wheel which is usually operated by

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
jog wheel which is usually operated by
your<00:00:44.640> index<00:00:44.969> finger<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.440> economic

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
your index finger and in this economic

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
your index finger and in this economic
ly<00:00:47.340> shaped<00:00:47.850> mouse<00:00:48.149> I've<00:00:48.690> actually<00:00:48.870> decided<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
ly shaped mouse I've actually decided to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.670 
ly shaped mouse I've actually decided to
position<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> by<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.609> thought<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:52.410> also

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
position it by my thought you also

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
position it by my thought you also
notice<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.550> left<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.000> click

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
notice that the left and the right click

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.259 
notice that the left and the right click
have<00:00:54.570> moved<00:00:54.840> from<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.410> horizontal<00:00:56.370> position<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
have moved from a horizontal position to

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.599 
have moved from a horizontal position to
a<00:00:57.300> vertical<00:00:57.600> position<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.399> things

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
a vertical position and little things

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
a vertical position and little things
like<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> switch<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> bottom<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.989> now

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
like the switch on the bottom have now

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
like the switch on the bottom have now
moved<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> top<00:01:01.679> so<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
moved to the top so as you can see it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.770 
moved to the top so as you can see it
switches<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.929> there<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> DPI<00:01:06.030> button<00:01:06.540> here

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
switches on there the DPI button here

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
switches on there the DPI button here
has<00:01:07.050> also<00:01:07.320> been<00:01:07.590> moved<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> thumb<00:01:08.370> control

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
has also been moved to a thumb control

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.260 
has also been moved to a thumb control
there<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:11.850> an

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
there so this is really I think an

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.110 
there so this is really I think an
interesting<00:01:13.050> tutorial<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.860> also<00:01:14.160> explore<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
interesting tutorial to also explore the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.690 
interesting tutorial to also explore the
age-old<00:01:15.660> debate<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.290> form<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> function<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
age-old debate of form and function and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.450 
age-old debate of form and function and
what<00:01:17.880> you'll<00:01:18.030> probably<00:01:18.240> find<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.230> you

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
what you'll probably find is that if you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.950 
what you'll probably find is that if you
give<00:01:20.460> yourself<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> time<00:01:21.480> to<00:01:21.780> just

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
give yourself a bit of time to just

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320 
give yourself a bit of time to just
sketch<00:01:22.260> out<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.980> think<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.850> organ

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
sketch out what you think your organ

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.350 
sketch out what you think your organ
amma<00:01:24.450> krause<00:01:24.690> might<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:26.360> regardless

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
amma krause might look like regardless

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
amma krause might look like regardless
of<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.630> good<00:01:28.050> just<00:01:28.290> catching<00:01:28.680> ability<00:01:28.800> is<00:01:29.250> in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
of how good just catching ability is in

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
of how good just catching ability is in
mine<00:01:29.550> isn't<00:01:29.850> great<00:01:30.120> you<00:01:30.810> might<00:01:31.020> end<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.350> with

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
mine isn't great you might end up with

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.350 
mine isn't great you might end up with
something<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.370> actually<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.120> work

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
something that actually when you work

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
something that actually when you work
with<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.750> styrofoam<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.410> start<00:01:34.890> sculpting

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
with the styrofoam and start sculpting

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.880 
with the styrofoam and start sculpting
it<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.760> fit<00:01:36.000> either<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.630> hand<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.500> someone

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it to fit either your hand or someone

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
it to fit either your hand or someone
else's<00:01:38.250> hand<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.870> takes<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.620> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
else's hand that it actually takes on a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.250 
else's hand that it actually takes on a
different<00:01:40.770> form<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.930> even<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.170> were

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
different form and even if you were

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.470 
different form and even if you were
close<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:44.130> example<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> buttons<00:01:44.910> being<00:01:45.180> here

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
close for example the buttons being here

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.870 
close for example the buttons being here
when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.410> actually<00:01:46.560> start<00:01:46.830> holding<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.730> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
when you actually start holding it and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
when you actually start holding it and
using<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.720> realize<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.500> things<00:01:49.950> need<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
using it you realize that things need a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
using it you realize that things need a
little<00:01:50.550> bit<00:01:50.730> of<00:01:50.760> adjustment<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.770> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
little bit of adjustment and this is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.530 
little bit of adjustment and this is
really<00:01:53.130> where<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> benefit<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.270> tutorial

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
really where the benefit of the tutorial

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
really where the benefit of the tutorial
is<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:55.530> you'll<00:01:55.680> go<00:01:55.920> through<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
is and that you'll go through the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.690 
is and that you'll go through the
processes<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.590> appreciating<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.920> makes<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.110 
processes of appreciating what makes a
successful<00:02:00.200> product<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.190> whether<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.000> for

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
successful product so whether it's for

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.000 
successful product so whether it's for
yourself<00:02:03.510> or<00:02:03.810> group<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.230> people<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:04.890> you

yourself or group of people that you

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.010 
yourself or group of people that you
test<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.490> among<00:02:05.850> there's<00:02:06.510> all<00:02:06.660> sorts<00:02:06.960> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
test this among there's all sorts of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
test this among there's all sorts of
options<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.590> sort<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> learn<00:02:08.069> from<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.690> one

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
options to sort of learn from this one

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.029 
options to sort of learn from this one
of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> other<00:02:10.020> things<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.440> well<00:02:10.470> I've<00:02:10.860> done

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
of the other things as well I've done

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.920 
of the other things as well I've done
just<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.640> sort<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.120> playful

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
just as a sort of little playful

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.979 
just as a sort of little playful
optional<00:02:13.530> extra<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.209> was<00:02:15.450> wanting<00:02:15.930> to

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
optional extra is that I was wanting to

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.479 
optional extra is that I was wanting to
make<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.560> whole<00:02:16.799> thing<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:17.159> little<00:02:17.370> bit

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
make this whole thing a little bit

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.650 
make this whole thing a little bit
griffey<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.060> I've<00:02:18.180> covered<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.659> sugru

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
griffey so I've covered it in sugru

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.730 
griffey so I've covered it in sugru
and<00:02:19.720> also<00:02:19.870> embedded<00:02:20.410> these<00:02:20.920> little<00:02:21.280> strips<00:02:21.640> of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
and also embedded these little strips of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970 
and also embedded these little strips of
styrene<00:02:23.740> plastic<00:02:24.670> into<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.390> now<00:02:26.290> other<00:02:26.800> than

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
styrene plastic into it now other than

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.920 
styrene plastic into it now other than
sort<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.310> making<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.730> look<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.120> little<00:02:28.240> bit<00:02:28.540> more

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
sort of making it look a little bit more

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.990 
sort of making it look a little bit more
interesting<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.740> defining<00:02:30.310> some<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.880> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
interesting and defining some of the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.300 
interesting and defining some of the
curves<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:32.050> also<00:02:32.260> gives<00:02:32.410> me<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.830> reference

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
curves it also gives me a reference

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
curves it also gives me a reference
point<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.880> what<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.120> thought<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.200> sort<00:02:35.440> of

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
point of what I thought the sort of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.040 
point of what I thought the sort of
parametric<00:02:36.070> curves<00:02:36.730> sometimes<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> dotty

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
parametric curves sometimes the dotty

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.160 
parametric curves sometimes the dotty
lines<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.680> drawn<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.750> industrial<00:02:40.750> design

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
lines you see drawn on industrial design

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.050 
lines you see drawn on industrial design
drawings<00:02:41.710> where<00:02:42.010> they<00:02:42.130> actually<00:02:42.550> end<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.850> on

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
drawings where they actually end up on

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.860 
drawings where they actually end up on
the<00:02:43.210> final<00:02:43.570> product<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.740> again<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:46.300> tutorial

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the final product so again this tutorial

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.350 
the final product so again this tutorial
is<00:02:46.990> primarily<00:02:47.440> about<00:02:47.920> how<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.520> work<00:02:48.820> with<00:02:49.090> foam

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
is primarily about how to work with foam

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.690 
is primarily about how to work with foam
but<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.200> also<00:02:50.350> gives<00:02:50.590> quite<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.920> bit<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.310> depth

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
but it also gives quite a bit of depth

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.200 
but it also gives quite a bit of depth
into<00:02:52.330> how<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:52.990> some<00:02:53.200> slightly<00:02:53.590> unusual

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
into how to do some slightly unusual

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.300 
into how to do some slightly unusual
modifications<00:02:55.210> with<00:02:55.450> electronics<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.950> also

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
modifications with electronics and also

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.460 
modifications with electronics and also
gives<00:02:57.940> an<00:02:58.060> opportunity<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.840> really<00:02:59.050> examine

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
gives an opportunity to really examine

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.590 
gives an opportunity to really examine
what<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.460> that<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> produce<00:03:01.000> when<00:03:01.480> you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
what it is that you produce when you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.500 
what it is that you produce when you
work<00:03:01.780> from<00:03:01.990> sketch<00:03:02.350> into<00:03:02.830> 3d<00:03:03.160> form<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.360> hope

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
work from sketch into 3d form so I hope

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.150 
work from sketch into 3d form so I hope
that's<00:03:04.630> useful<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.200> next<00:03:05.680> we'll<00:03:05.830> take<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> look

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that's useful and next we'll take a look

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.320 
that's useful and next we'll take a look
at<00:03:06.250> some<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.580> tools<00:03:06.760> you'll<00:03:06.970> need<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.210> do

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
at some of the tools you'll need to do

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.510 
at some of the tools you'll need to do
this
