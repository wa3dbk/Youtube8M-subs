00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
build a team around this guy I think all

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.410 
build a team around this guy I think all
the<00:00:45.440> talk<00:00:45.649> about<00:00:45.679> how<00:00:46.129> about<00:00:46.429> being<00:00:46.609> back<00:00:46.850> this

the talk about how about being back this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.329 
the talk about how about being back this
is<00:00:47.569> like<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.809> ultimate<00:00:47.839> lockout<00:00:48.649> situation

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
is like the ultimate lockout situation

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.009 
is like the ultimate lockout situation
this<00:00:49.640> would<00:00:49.819> have<00:00:49.909> been<00:00:49.940> sealed<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.839> done

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
this would have been sealed and done

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.079 
this would have been sealed and done
with<00:00:51.260> in<00:00:51.499> a<00:00:51.800> normal<00:00:51.949> year<00:00:52.190> they've<00:00:52.730> had<00:00:52.760> to

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
with in a normal year they've had to

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.939 
with in a normal year they've had to
wait<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:53.539> think<00:00:53.929> there's<00:00:54.079> some<00:00:54.319> sort<00:00:54.829> of

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
wait I think there's some sort of

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.319 
wait I think there's some sort of
leaning<00:00:55.309> towards<00:00:55.339> bringing<00:00:55.879> him<00:00:56.120> back

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
leaning towards bringing him back

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.239 
leaning towards bringing him back
because<00:00:56.989> they<00:00:57.199> just<00:00:57.319> don't<00:00:57.469> trust<00:00:57.739> Whitehurst

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
because they just don't trust Whitehurst

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.040 
because they just don't trust Whitehurst
completely<00:00:58.670> right<00:00:58.850> now<00:00:58.999> we've<00:00:59.690> heard<00:00:59.870> other
