the wall at shoulder-width apart we feel

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.950 
the wall at shoulder-width apart we feel
that's<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.309> best<00:00:11.639> athletic<00:00:12.059> position<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.840> get

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that's the best athletic position to get

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.720 
that's the best athletic position to get
a<00:00:13.019> good<00:00:13.230> jump<00:00:13.559> off<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.009> wall<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.370> after<00:00:14.639> all

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
a good jump off the wall and after all

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.890 
a good jump off the wall and after all
this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.210> we're<00:00:15.389> looking<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.719> right

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this is what we're looking for right

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
this is what we're looking for right
here<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.320> simply<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.830> horizontal<00:00:17.490> jump

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
here is just simply a horizontal jump

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.050 
here is just simply a horizontal jump
off<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> wall<00:00:18.619> streamline<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.949> push<00:00:20.820> off

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
words we don't want a circle into the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209

wall<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> push<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> goes<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
wall and get a push off that goes a

little<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.789> down<00:00:51.120> Megan<00:00:52.079> did<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> good<00:00:52.559> job

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
little bit down Megan did a good job

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
little bit down Megan did a good job
with<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.070> turn<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
with that turn we're gonna do it a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
with that turn we're gonna do it a
couple<00:00:54.360> times<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.410> again<00:00:55.739> each<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.520> can

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
couple times so again each time we can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
couple times so again each time we can
focus<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> different<00:00:57.570> element<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> turn

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

Megan<00:00:59.010> did<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> nice<00:00:59.399> job<00:00:59.760> though<00:01:00.030> keeping<00:01:00.840> her

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
Megan did a nice job though keeping her

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
Megan did a nice job though keeping her
momentum<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.649> through<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> wall<00:01:02.280> getting

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
momentum going through the wall getting

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
momentum going through the wall getting
a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.270> bit<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.690> bounce<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.229> she<00:01:04.409> landed

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
a little bit of a bounce when she landed

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
a little bit of a bounce when she landed
on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> wall<00:01:05.280> being<00:01:05.939> streamlined<00:01:06.450> before<00:01:06.960> she

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
on the wall being streamlined before she

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
on the wall being streamlined before she
left<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.650> wall<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.610> carrying<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
left the wall and then carrying that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.289 
left the wall and then carrying that
speed<00:01:09.750> into<00:01:10.439> her<00:01:10.530> breakout<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.030> Megan

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
speed into her breakout all right Megan

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
speed into her breakout all right Megan
we're<00:01:12.540> gonna<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:13.020> drill<00:01:13.380> again<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
we're gonna go one drill again you can

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
we're gonna go one drill again you can
see<00:01:17.040> Megan<00:01:17.400> keeps<00:01:17.640> her<00:01:17.790> head<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.150> line<00:01:18.390> nice

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
see Megan keeps her head in line nice

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
see Megan keeps her head in line nice
and<00:01:19.560> smooth<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.939> dive<00:01:21.180> on

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and smooth a little bit of a dive on

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
and smooth a little bit of a dive on
that<00:01:21.630> last<00:01:21.869> stroke<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> wall<00:01:22.710> she<00:01:22.979> speeds

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that last stroke to the wall she speeds

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
that last stroke to the wall she speeds
up<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> hair<00:01:24.240> does<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> great<00:01:25.650> job<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
up just the hair does a great job of

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.300 
up just the hair does a great job of
carrying<00:01:26.880> her<00:01:27.119> speed<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> wall<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
carrying her speed off of the wall and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
carrying her speed off of the wall and
one<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.000> small<00:01:30.420> things<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.990> makes<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
one of the the small things that makes a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
one of the the small things that makes a
big<00:01:31.680> difference<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> fact<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.240> she

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
big difference is the fact that when she

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.440 
big difference is the fact that when she
breaks<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:34.170> she's<00:01:34.470> breaking<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.880> flat

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
breaks out she's breaking out very flat

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
breaks out she's breaking out very flat
she's<00:01:36.810> holding<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> great<00:01:37.590> line<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> water

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
she's holding a great line in the water

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
she's holding a great line in the water
the<00:01:39.000> reason<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the reason that we want to do that is we

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
the reason that we want to do that is we
want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> avoid<00:01:41.340> any<00:01:41.579> resistance<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> even<00:01:43.590> if

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
want to avoid any resistance and even if

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.520 
want to avoid any resistance and even if
the<00:01:43.860> resistance<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.390> much<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the resistance is just that much it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649 
the resistance is just that much it's
going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> slow<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> athlete<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
going to slow the athlete down so one of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
going to slow the athlete down so one of
the<00:01:48.780> coaching<00:01:49.200> points<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.680> make<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.250> ask

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the coaching points we make is we ask

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
the coaching points we make is we ask
Megan<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> break<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.720> her<00:01:51.840> face<00:01:52.200> first

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
Megan to break out with her face first

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.910 
Megan to break out with her face first
and<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.850> her<00:01:54.149> fingertips<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.710> we

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and not her fingertips that way we

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800 
and not her fingertips that way we
ensure<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.700> whole<00:01:56.880> body<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.689> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
ensure that the whole body is going to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
ensure that the whole body is going to
break<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> surface<00:01:58.469> again<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.640> nice

wall that's an excellent example of what

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.640 
wall that's an excellent example of what
we<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.320> refer<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.370> one<00:02:21.820> drill<00:02:22.650> I'd

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
we like to refer to as one drill I'd

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.770 
we like to refer to as one drill I'd
like<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.070> point<00:02:24.340> out<00:02:24.550> another<00:02:25.330> small<00:02:25.750> detail

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.990 
like to point out another small detail
that<00:02:26.440> makes<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.830> big<00:02:27.040> difference<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.850> is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
that makes a big difference and that is

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.870 
that makes a big difference and that is
when<00:02:28.420> Megan<00:02:28.810> follows<00:02:29.290> her<00:02:29.500> last<00:02:29.770> half<00:02:30.220> cycle

a<00:02:44.020> little<00:02:44.170> bit<00:02:44.320> quicker<00:02:44.620> she's<00:02:45.400> going<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.670> be

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
a little bit quicker she's going to be

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.490 
a little bit quicker she's going to be
tight<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.330> body<00:02:46.510> from<00:02:46.930> there<00:02:47.140> she's<00:02:47.350> going

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
tight to the body from there she's going

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.220 
tight to the body from there she's going
to<00:02:47.590> get<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.950> streamline<00:02:48.580> very<00:02:49.390> quickly<00:02:49.780> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
to get to a streamline very quickly and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.370 
to get to a streamline very quickly and
this<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> key<00:02:51.720> every<00:02:52.720> athlete<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.320> you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
this is a key every athlete that you

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
this is a key every athlete that you
have<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.890> your<00:02:54.040> team<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.370> streamline<00:02:55.120> off<00:02:55.630> of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
have on your team can streamline off of

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.050 
have on your team can streamline off of
a<00:02:55.959> starter<00:02:56.380> off<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.830> turn<00:02:57.070> faster<00:02:57.760> than<00:02:57.910> they

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
a starter off of a turn faster than they

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.759 
a starter off of a turn faster than they
can<00:02:58.239> swim<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> surface<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> water<00:02:59.620> so

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
can swim on the surface of the water so

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.400 
can swim on the surface of the water so
we<00:03:00.040> want<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.370> maximize<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:01.090> speed<00:03:01.750> one<00:03:02.290> of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
we want to maximize that speed one of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.350 
we want to maximize that speed one of
the<00:03:02.470> critical<00:03:02.950> elements<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.610> great<00:03:03.910> turn<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
the critical elements to a great turn is

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.600 
the critical elements to a great turn is
being<00:03:04.570> streamlined<00:03:04.980> before<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.250> leave<00:03:06.459> the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
being streamlined before you leave the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.030 
being streamlined before you leave the
wall<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:07.390> we've<00:03:07.570> got<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:07.989> quick<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.650> from

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
wall so we've got to be quick going from

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.270 
wall so we've got to be quick going from
here<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:10.150> here<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:11.290> getting<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.799> jump

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
here to here and then getting that jump

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.030 
here to here and then getting that jump
off<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.850> wall
