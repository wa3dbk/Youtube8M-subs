00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:13.160 
this will form the wings next I will do
a<00:01:05.760> triangular<00:01:06.760> shape<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.240> tail

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.960 

and<00:01:14.170> he'll<00:01:14.760> draw<00:01:16.350> samples<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.810> give<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.110> form

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and he'll draw samples to give it form

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:34.410 
and he'll draw samples to give it form
to<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> tail<00:01:30.210> next<00:01:31.210> our<00:01:31.960> draw<00:01:32.850> lines<00:01:33.850> going

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
to the tail next our draw lines going

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:48.930 
to the tail next our draw lines going
down<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.490> certain<00:01:36.490> point<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
middle of each circle I'll draw a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:03.990 
middle of each circle I'll draw a
smaller<00:01:52.330> circle<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.640> fill<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.759> in<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.850> I'm
