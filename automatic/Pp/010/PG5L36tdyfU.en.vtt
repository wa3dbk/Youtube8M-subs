about is creating the levels for our
game<00:00:04.680> using<00:00:05.400> tiled<00:00:05.819> tiled<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:07.109> an<00:00:07.319> open<00:00:07.710> source

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
game using tiled tiled is an open source

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.870 
game using tiled tiled is an open source
map<00:00:08.519> editor<00:00:09.200> specially<00:00:10.200> designed<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:11.070> tile

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.259 
map editor specially designed for tile
based<00:00:12.179> games<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.590> quintus<00:00:14.219> framework<00:00:15.059> which

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
based games the quintus framework which

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
based games the quintus framework which
is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> JavaScript<00:00:15.900> library<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.830> we'll<00:00:17.039> be

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
is the JavaScript library that we'll be

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.210 
is the JavaScript library that we'll be
using<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.210> course<00:00:18.619> supports<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.920> tiled

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
using in this course supports the tiled

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.810 
using in this course supports the tiled
file<00:00:21.090> format<00:00:21.630> which<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.080> TMX<00:00:22.980> file<00:00:23.340> format

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
file format which is a TMX file format

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.359 
file format which is a TMX file format
so<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.990> create<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> levels<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> our<00:00:26.099> game

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
so we can create the levels of our game

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.269 
so we can create the levels of our game
using<00:00:26.820> tiled<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.390> then<00:00:27.810> load<00:00:28.230> those<00:00:28.830> levels

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
using tiled and then load those levels

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.659 
using tiled and then load those levels
in<00:00:29.609> our<00:00:29.929> html5<00:00:30.929> game

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
in our html5 game

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.970 
in our html5 game

operating system now let me show you how

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.930 
operating system now let me show you how
tile<00:00:53.340> works<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.250> final<00:00:56.640> level

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
tile works this is what the final level

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.049 
tile works this is what the final level
is<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.850> see

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
is going to look like so as you can see

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
is going to look like so as you can see
on<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.570> side<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> screen<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
on this side of the screen you have the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
on this side of the screen you have the
actual<00:01:02.940> level<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.870> zoom<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.680> out

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actual level you can zoom in and out

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.830 
actual level you can zoom in and out
using<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> key<00:01:07.260> control<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.490> mouse

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
using the key control and your mouse

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.530 
using the key control and your mouse
wheel<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:11.310> side<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.119> different

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
wheel on this side you have different

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.590 
wheel on this side you have different
layers<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.520> our<00:01:14.729> game<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
layers so in our game we're going to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.109 
layers so in our game we're going to
have<00:01:15.720> four<00:01:16.140> different<00:01:16.320> layers<00:01:17.090> by<00:01:18.090> clicking

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
have four different layers by clicking

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
have four different layers by clicking
on<00:01:18.659> these<00:01:18.780> checkboxes<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.770> show<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
on these checkboxes we can show them and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.359 
on these checkboxes we can show them and
hide<00:01:21.030> them<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.770> DIF

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
hide them so that you can DIF

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
hide them so that you can DIF
differentiate<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.479> belongs<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> each<00:01:25.470> one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
differentiate what belongs to each one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.370 
differentiate what belongs to each one
of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> layers<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:27.720> layer<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.229> we'll

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
of the layers the first layer that we'll

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.550 
of the layers the first layer that we'll
have<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> background<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
have is going to be a background and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
have is going to be a background and
we'll<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.890> second<00:01:32.369> background<00:01:32.790> just

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
we'll have a second background just

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.690 
we'll have a second background just
because<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> add<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.560> extra

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
because we want to add some extra

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.539 
because we want to add some extra
decorations<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:37.200> we'll<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.159> collision

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
decorations then we'll have a collision

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
decorations then we'll have a collision
layer<00:01:38.939> which<00:01:39.270> contains<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.110> elements

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
layer which contains all of the elements

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.310 
layer which contains all of the elements
that<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.860> collide<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> player

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
that will collide with the player

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.359 
that will collide with the player
basically<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> ground<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:45.090> walls

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
basically the ground and the walls

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.700 
basically the ground and the walls
lastly<00:01:47.369> we'll<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.270> layer<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.780> objects

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
lastly we'll have a layer of objects

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280 
lastly we'll have a layer of objects
which<00:01:50.100> will<00:01:50.579> represent<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.899> different

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
which will represent the different

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.190 
which will represent the different
entities<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.399> our<00:01:53.700> game<00:01:54.030> I'm<00:01:54.600> talking<00:01:55.140> about

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.020 
let me show you how to create a new
level<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> new<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
level you go to new and you have to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
level you go to new and you have to
define<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.599> width<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> height<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
define the width and height of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.910 
define the width and height of
map<00:02:13.859> in<00:02:14.189> terms<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.700> number<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.359> tiles<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:16.439> this

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
map in terms of number of tiles so this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.360 
map in terms of number of tiles so this
particular<00:02:17.459> map<00:02:17.730> has<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.269> number<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.780> tiles<00:02:18.989> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
particular map has a number of tiles and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.729 
particular map has a number of tiles and
I'm<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.969> to<00:02:21.030> create<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.390> small<00:02:21.870> map<00:02:22.230> that's

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
I'm going to create a small map that's

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.190 
I'm going to create a small map that's
going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.159> 38<00:02:24.060> x<00:02:24.599> 38<00:02:25.140> tiles<00:02:26.599> now<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
going to have 38 x 38 tiles now the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
going to have 38 x 38 tiles now the
other<00:02:28.409> thing<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.829> need<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.069> specify<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.909> the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
other thing you need to specify is the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.649 
other thing you need to specify is the
size<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.109> each<00:02:31.349> tile<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.760> case<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.389> size

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
size of each tile in this case the size

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.910 
size of each tile in this case the size
of<00:02:33.780> each<00:02:33.959> tile<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.409> 21<00:02:35.159> pixels<00:02:36.439> so<00:02:37.439> this<00:02:37.680> gives

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
of each tile is 21 pixels so this gives

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720 
of each tile is 21 pixels so this gives
me<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.129> new<00:02:38.549> map<00:02:39.079> now<00:02:40.079> we<00:02:40.349> need<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.859> tile<00:02:41.189> set<00:02:41.519> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
me a new map now we need a tile set a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.149 
me a new map now we need a tile set a
tile<00:02:42.180> set<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.750> file<00:02:43.290> containing<00:02:43.500> many

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
tile set is a file containing many

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.000 
tile set is a file containing many
images<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:45.659> each<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.139> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> terrain<00:02:46.709> tiles

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
images for each one of the terrain tiles

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.390 
images for each one of the terrain tiles
and<00:02:47.310> game<00:02:47.730> elements<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.389> want<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.750> have
