00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
one I think with Avari it's gonna be

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.069 
one I think with Avari it's gonna be
just<00:00:48.270> understanding<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> game

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just understanding the game

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.990 
just understanding the game
understanding<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.070> office<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
understanding what office want to do to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
understanding what office want to do to
him<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.390> their<00:00:51.570> spacing<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.530> their

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
him with their spacing with their

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
him with their spacing with their
formations<00:00:53.309> being<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.120> sound

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
formations being really sound

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
formations being really sound
technically<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.800> Sky's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
technically and I think that Sky's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
technically and I think that Sky's
limits<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.699> khabari<00:00:57.000> basically<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
limits really khabari basically what you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
on Texas for us day to day um just

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.979 
on Texas for us day to day um just
getting<00:03:33.760> better<00:03:33.850> day<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.180> day<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.600> think<00:03:34.720> that

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
getting better day to day I think that

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.440 
getting better day to day I think that
if<00:03:35.110> we<00:03:35.140> take<00:03:35.470> each<00:03:35.739> opportunity<00:03:36.340> daily<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.300> get

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
if we take each opportunity daily to get

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.390 
if we take each opportunity daily to get
better<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:38.410> know<00:03:38.530> both<00:03:38.709> intellectually<00:03:39.310> with
