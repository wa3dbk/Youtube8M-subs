00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
model and here today I'm going to show

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.250 
model and here today I'm going to show
you<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.120> little<00:00:12.240> bit<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.629> what<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.930> can<00:00:13.080> do

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
you a little bit about what it can do

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.779 
you a little bit about what it can do
and<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.680> features<00:00:14.039> that<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.309> has<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.699> for

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
and the features that it has going for

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.930 
and the features that it has going for
it<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.959> D<00:00:16.170> 3200<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.279> addition<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
it now the D 3200 is in addition to the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.700 
it now the D 3200 is in addition to the
cons<00:00:18.150> range<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.779> replacing<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
cons range it's not replacing the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.370 
cons range it's not replacing the
previous<00:00:19.859> model<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> D<00:00:21.120> 3100<00:00:21.990> will<00:00:22.140> still

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
previous model so the D 3100 will still

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.830 
previous model so the D 3100 will still
be<00:00:22.530> available<00:00:22.910> now<00:00:23.910> what<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.270> new<00:00:24.420> model<00:00:24.720> has

be available now what this new model has

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
be available now what this new model has
going<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.440> massive<00:00:25.860> hike<00:00:26.250> in

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
going for it is a massive hike in

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.779 
going for it is a massive hike in
megapixels<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.510> from<00:00:28.110> 14.1<00:00:29.100> megapixels<00:00:29.700> on

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
megapixels up from 14.1 megapixels on

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.029 
megapixels up from 14.1 megapixels on
the<00:00:29.880> previous<00:00:30.270> model<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.440> model<00:00:31.800> which

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
the previous model to this model which

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.590 
the previous model to this model which
has<00:00:32.279> twenty<00:00:32.789> four<00:00:32.969> point<00:00:33.180> two<00:00:33.420> megapixel

has twenty four point two megapixel

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
has twenty four point two megapixel
resolution<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.309> should<00:00:35.550> mean<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.760> if

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
resolution and that should mean that if

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.369 
resolution and that should mean that if
you<00:00:36.120> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.359> blow<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.809> picture<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.319> should

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
you want to blow up a picture you should

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.229 
you want to blow up a picture you should
be<00:00:37.559> able<00:00:37.679> to<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:38.280> focus<00:00:38.609> in<00:00:38.760> those<00:00:38.940> smaller

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
be able to really focus in those smaller

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
be able to really focus in those smaller
details<00:00:39.769> now<00:00:40.769> because<00:00:41.039> it's<00:00:41.190> an<00:00:41.309> entry-level

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
details now because it's an entry-level

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.579 
details now because it's an entry-level
model<00:00:42.179> they<00:00:42.659> kind<00:00:42.839> of<00:00:42.870> tried<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.229> make<00:00:43.409> this

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
model they kind of tried to make this

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.410 
model they kind of tried to make this
camera<00:00:43.890> capture<00:00:44.339> really<00:00:44.670> good<00:00:44.850> images<00:00:45.239> and

movies but also be incredibly easy to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.790 
movies but also be incredibly easy to
use<00:00:47.429> and<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.870> reason<00:00:49.079> they've<00:00:49.409> enhanced

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
