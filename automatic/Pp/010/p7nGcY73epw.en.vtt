00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
Any concept in computing is inevitably an abstraction

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.820
of a more complicated concept underneath.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940
And if you think about using a computer-

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.340
you're clicking around on the screen

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.020
and the things that you are clicking on the screen

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.220
are widgets.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.520
So, if we look at the title bar like this then

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.060
there's three buttons up here

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.100
those are widgets on the computer screen.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.580
For most people, I think, that's where...

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400
their understanding of computers begins and ends.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
But, obviously when I push that button

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.320
that prompts the computer to go away

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.120
and do something.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.680
How does it turn that input

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.560
into some electronic stimuli?

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.380
If everytime we wanted to describe

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.000
how the click button on the screen worked

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.040
I'd have to talk to you in terms of electrons

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
bouncing around inside a wire

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.760
and explain the quantum mechanics of a transistor.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.520
Then it would take an enormous amount of time

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.960
and so...

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.240
instead of talking about quantum mechanics in a transistor

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.700
Iabstract that idea

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.580
and I say, "Look, the transistor is just a switch..."

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.780
"and that switch can be opened or closed."

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.260
And the electrons traveling down the wire

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.380
They're either there...or they're not there

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.800
which is a 1 or a 0

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.620
in numphile we talk about 1's and 0's a lot

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.340
so um..(laughing) we won't get back into that.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020
but it's just numbers traveling down wire.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.260
Most computers are 32-bit and 64-bit these days.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960
We  have a series of wires

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.520
-parallel wires- which run together;

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.620
and we give those a fancy name, called bus.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.180
And so those 1's and 0's...

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.620
are traveling down the bus and they represent numbers.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.460
And then it's a question of, "Well what do those numbers mean?"

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.960
Well those numbers....they come back to be

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
a computer program.  Which is...

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.420
A series of very specific instructions.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.420
It's still quite a big thing.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.980
To ask somebody to start with a bunch of switches and 1's and 0's

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.020
and turn those into something which

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.880
takes two numbers and it adds them together.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.420
Alright?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.400
That is a difficult question.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.360
And, so...

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.400
We take the switches and the 1's and 0's

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.780
and we turn those into...

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.420
things with logic gates.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.260
Things which do...

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.780
simple...

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.560
human understandable instructions.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.120
So...

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.880
and-ing two numbers together or or-ing two numbers together

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880
Really, actually, quite simple concepts.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.080
But the point is that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.520
that you take the switches and you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.800
abstract those into a gate.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.780
You take the gate

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.380
and you abstract that into an instruction like...

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.400
add, or subtract, or muiltiply.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.700
At the very end of all of this what we have is a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.529
script; a computer program which is

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.460
human readable...

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.720
which...

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.100
can execute on the processor...

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.860
and draw a window, draw a button on the screen.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.440
We've gone from a switch

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.400
and a series of 1's and 0's:

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.980
Electrons,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.240
transistors, quantum mechanics

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.840
all the way to...

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.360
having pixels drawn on a screen

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.860
in - what?  5?  10 steps?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.860
and, its simple layers of abstraction

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.840
and, it allows us to talk about computers.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.400
at an appropriate level.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.680
So, that we don't have to understand

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.420
all of quantum mechanics every time 
I want to draw a button on the screen

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.000
because it would just be unwieldy.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.380
I have an iPhone, right?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.680
I don't think that's going to be a surprise to anybody.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.840
Although, by the way, I much prefer the windows phone.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.920
And I know that my nephew's have got smart phones

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.320
and, I see a lot of kids using game's consoles and smart phones.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.960
These things... [exhales in frustration]

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.060
don't encourage you to understand what's going on under the hood.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.380
I mean here is a really slick piece of engineering,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.360
and it's completely closed.  It's a black box.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.480
What we've done is

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.520
we've abstracted the concept of a computer

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.100
to the point where it's one single black box,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160
and  I don't need to understand how any of this works.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.360
All I need to know, and this is amazing, I mean...

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.180
plaudits to Apple for this

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.300
All I need to know is that this one button does everything.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.780
I press this button ...

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.320
and it does everything.  Which is a remarkable achievement.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.480
That is what abstraction can do for you

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.860
That... it worries me as an engineer and as a scientist

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.040
that, if this is what kids are growing up with,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400
what is it that's encouraging them to ask the question,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.100
"How does this work?"

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.920
Where's the new generation of engineers and scientists

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.320
and people who want to take this apart.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.060
There's not even a screw I can take out.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.920
Where are the people who want to take this apart

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.060
and see how this works going to come from

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.300
if there's not a screw that I can take out the back

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.220
and have a really good fiddle around inside?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.720
I remember my Acorn Electron, its appeared in other videos -

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.020
"Isn't that satisfying"

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.820
- the biggest blocky-est  piece of computer you could possibly imagine,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.020
it had a terribly non-ergonomic keyboard

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.780
crucially, it had screws in the back

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.780
And I could take them out and I could open it up

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.780
and I could see how this thing worked

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.500
or I could begin to imagine how this thing worked

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.680
and that's what fired the imagination on an eleven year old James.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.840
Today, I know, it's a really difficult thing to say,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.520
"How do you take a child and you introduce them to the concept of the 1's and 0's

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.560
which are underlying the computer?"

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.980
I am a computerphile.  I can't wait to do these videos

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.160
but we can't talk about

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.920
anything without first of all defining our terms, right?
