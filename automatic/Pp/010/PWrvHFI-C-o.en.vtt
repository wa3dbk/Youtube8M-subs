00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
she has been dubbed Yamaha and because

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.269 
she has been dubbed Yamaha and because
she<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.670> beautiful<00:00:25.000> every<00:00:25.720> single<00:00:25.750> way<00:00:26.320> we

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
she is beautiful every single way we

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.320 
she is beautiful every single way we
found<00:00:27.490> her<00:00:27.580> in<00:00:27.610> a<00:00:27.700> dump<00:00:27.910> there's<00:00:28.090> no<00:00:28.180> we're

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
found her in a dump there's no we're

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.580 
found her in a dump there's no we're
being<00:00:28.419> a<00:00:28.540> little<00:00:28.779> bit<00:00:28.900> ambitious<00:00:29.169> that's<00:00:29.500> a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
being a little bit ambitious that's a

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.100 
being a little bit ambitious that's a
bit<00:00:29.770> of<00:00:29.860> wiring<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:31.210> like<00:00:31.300> a<00:00:31.390> kitten<00:00:31.689> yeah

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
bit of wiring first like a kitten yeah

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.970 
bit of wiring first like a kitten yeah
it's<00:00:32.290> just<00:00:32.349> hard<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.619> start<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.440> she<00:00:35.590> smokes<00:00:35.800> a

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
it's just hard to start and she smokes a

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.540 
it's just hard to start and she smokes a
lot<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:38.320> know<00:00:38.410> really<00:00:38.680> sick

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
lot you know really sick

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.180 
lot you know really sick
alright<00:00:40.540> when<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:41.020> first<00:00:41.230> got<00:00:41.350> this<00:00:41.530> sled<00:00:41.800> we

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
alright when we first got this sled we

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.189 
alright when we first got this sled we
had<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.579> lot<00:00:42.789> of<00:00:42.820> bad<00:00:43.149> electrical<00:00:43.539> connections

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
had a lot of bad electrical connections

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.689 
had a lot of bad electrical connections
and<00:00:44.379> bad<00:00:44.530> electrical<00:00:44.710> components<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:45.609> all

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
and bad electrical components and all

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:46.889 
and bad electrical components and all
the<00:00:45.789> electrical<00:00:46.149> connections<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.600> we<00:00:46.719> did

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
the electrical connections that we did

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.380 
the electrical connections that we did
have<00:00:47.109> were<00:00:47.890> faulty<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:48.940> they<00:00:49.059> didn't<00:00:49.239> work

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
have were faulty and they didn't work

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.540 
have were faulty and they didn't work
properly<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.350> decided<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:51.129> figure<00:00:51.309> out

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
properly so we decided to figure out

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.979 
properly so we decided to figure out
what<00:00:52.059> do<00:00:52.149> we<00:00:52.239> actually<00:00:52.390> need<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.750> get<00:00:52.840> the

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
what do we actually need to get the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.799 
what do we actually need to get the
engine<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.680> run<00:00:53.859> to<00:00:54.129> get<00:00:54.250> spark<00:00:54.670> so<00:00:55.120> we<00:00:55.449> went<00:00:55.719> to

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
engine to run to get spark so we went to

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.419 
engine to run to get spark so we went to
our<00:00:55.840> big<00:00:56.079> old<00:00:56.230> stack<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.710> wires<00:00:56.890> coming<00:00:57.280> out

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
our big old stack of wires coming out

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.220 
our big old stack of wires coming out
from<00:00:57.579> our<00:00:57.730> engine<00:00:58.179> and<00:00:58.359> we<00:00:58.629> found<00:00:58.870> which<00:00:59.050> one

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
from our engine and we found which one

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.080 
from our engine and we found which one
was<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.679> one<00:00:59.710> that<00:00:59.980> charged<00:01:00.340> so<00:01:00.550> we<00:01:00.670> stick<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
was the one that charged so we stick a

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.090 
was the one that charged so we stick a
voltmeter<00:01:01.449> into<00:01:02.199> this<00:01:02.289> wire<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.769> then<00:01:02.859> stick

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
voltmeter into this wire and then stick

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.560 
voltmeter into this wire and then stick
it<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.280> ground<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.850> then<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.420> would

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
it to ground and then that would

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.150 
it to ground and then that would
determine<00:01:04.839> which<00:01:05.110> wire<00:01:05.320> has<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.740> charge<00:01:05.920> out

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
determine which wire has to charge out

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.480 
determine which wire has to charge out
of<00:01:06.250> it

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
of it

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.160 
of it
once<00:01:06.760> we<00:01:06.910> determine<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.390> charge<00:01:07.630> wire<00:01:07.900> coming

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
once we determine the charge wire coming

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.230 
once we determine the charge wire coming
out<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.410> it<00:01:08.500> we<00:01:08.770> find<00:01:08.980> this<00:01:09.100> corresponding<00:01:09.910> CDI

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
out of it we find this corresponding CDI

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.390 
out of it we find this corresponding CDI
wire<00:01:10.600> which<00:01:11.110> in<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.320> case<00:01:11.470> was<00:01:11.680> Brown<00:01:12.040> we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
wire which in this case was Brown we

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.160 
wire which in this case was Brown we
connect<00:01:12.700> those<00:01:12.820> two<00:01:13.060> up<00:01:13.210> then<00:01:13.660> we<00:01:13.840> go<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.050> the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
connect those two up then we go to the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.289 
connect those two up then we go to the
coil<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:15.040> we<00:01:15.100> find<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.579> what<00:01:15.790> color<00:01:16.000> wire

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
coil and we find that what color wire

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.210 
coil and we find that what color wire
the<00:01:16.540> coil<00:01:16.840> has<00:01:17.079> and<00:01:17.350> we<00:01:17.409> connect<00:01:17.740> those<00:01:17.950> two

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
the coil has and we connect those two

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.010 
the coil has and we connect those two
connecting<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.820> CDI<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.390> those<00:01:19.780> are<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
connecting the CDI and those are the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.270 
connecting the CDI and those are the
only<00:01:20.170> two<00:01:20.439> wires<00:01:20.650> we<00:01:20.860> need<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.040> connect

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
only two wires we need to connect

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.370 
only two wires we need to connect
through<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.520> coil<00:01:21.850> CDI<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:23.020> magneto

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
through the coil CDI and the magneto

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.170 
through the coil CDI and the magneto
then<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.100> one<00:01:24.280> from<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.549> coil<00:01:24.790> we<00:01:24.970> need<00:01:25.119> to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
then the one from the coil we need to

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.819 
then the one from the coil we need to
ground<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.659> so<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:25.960> grounded<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.380> snowmobile

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
ground it so we grounded the snowmobile

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.859 
ground it so we grounded the snowmobile
and<00:01:27.040> if<00:01:27.430> all<00:01:27.610> tensions<00:01:28.000> are<00:01:28.090> proper<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.659> should

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
and if all tensions are proper we should

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.840 
and if all tensions are proper we should
get<00:01:29.020> spark<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.710> our<00:01:29.799> spark<00:01:30.130> plug<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.579> all<00:01:30.729> we

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
get spark to our spark plug so all we

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.969 
get spark to our spark plug so all we
need<00:01:30.970> power<00:01:31.810> coming<00:01:32.020> from<00:01:32.079> Agni<00:01:32.350> tow<00:01:32.470> power

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
need power coming from Agni tow power

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
need power coming from Agni tow power
comes<00:01:33.189> from<00:01:33.220> CDI<00:01:33.640> ground<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.509> coil<00:01:34.829> sparks

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
comes from CDI ground the coil sparks

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.359 
comes from CDI ground the coil sparks
all<00:01:37.720> right<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.439> we've<00:01:38.619> determined<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:39.250> our

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
all right so we've determined that our

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.429 
all right so we've determined that our
charge<00:01:39.759> wire<00:01:40.000> coming<00:01:40.329> out<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.540> our<00:01:40.719> magneto<00:01:41.140> is

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
charge wire coming out of our magneto is

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.679 
charge wire coming out of our magneto is
our<00:01:41.860> Brown<00:01:42.100> wire<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.640> also<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:43.540> know

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
our Brown wire and also that we know

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.560 
our Brown wire and also that we know
that<00:01:43.869> our<00:01:43.930> CDI<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.920> stock<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.090> therefore<00:01:46.420> we

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
that our CDI is stock so therefore we

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.289 
that our CDI is stock so therefore we
connect<00:01:46.869> our<00:01:47.020> Brown<00:01:47.290> wire<00:01:47.640> directly<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
connect our Brown wire directly to the

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.060 
connect our Brown wire directly to the
brown<00:01:49.570> wire<00:01:49.810> coming<00:01:50.350> out<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.680> Magneto

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
brown wire coming out of the Magneto

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.130 
brown wire coming out of the Magneto
once<00:01:51.909> it's<00:01:52.090> go<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.420> electricity<00:01:52.810> goes<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.049> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
once it's go the electricity goes to the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.469 
once it's go the electricity goes to the
CDI<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.710> has<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.219> have<00:01:54.369> an<00:01:54.610> output<00:01:55.119> so<00:01:55.360> an

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
CDI it has to have an output so an

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.630 
CDI it has to have an output so an
output<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.140> our<00:01:56.469> orange<00:01:56.740> wire<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.219> we<00:01:57.369> found

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
output is our orange wire that we found

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.789 
output is our orange wire that we found
from<00:01:58.360> our<00:01:58.479> coil<00:01:58.869> because<00:01:59.289> we<00:01:59.409> know<00:01:59.500> our<00:01:59.619> coil

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
from our coil because we know our coil

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.469 
from our coil because we know our coil
stock<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.250> our<00:02:00.369> CDI<00:02:00.729> stock<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:01.240> we<00:02:01.329> took

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
stock with our CDI stock so we took

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.139 
stock with our CDI stock so we took
those<00:02:01.719> and<00:02:01.990> we<00:02:02.380> directly<00:02:02.950> connected<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.490> via<00:02:04.000> a

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
those and we directly connected it via a

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.020 
those and we directly connected it via a
red<00:02:04.600> wire<00:02:04.840> both<00:02:05.560> are<00:02:05.740> used<00:02:05.920> red<00:02:06.130> wire<00:02:06.340> try<00:02:06.969> to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
red wire both are used red wire try to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.600 
red wire both are used red wire try to
avoid<00:02:07.390> confusion<00:02:07.719> next<00:02:08.680> we<00:02:08.950> need<00:02:09.130> one<00:02:09.580> more

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
avoid confusion next we need one more

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.040 
avoid confusion next we need one more
wire<00:02:09.940> coming<00:02:10.180> out<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> coil<00:02:10.690> that's<00:02:10.869> to

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
wire coming out of the coil that's to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.540 
wire coming out of the coil that's to
ground<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.440> coil<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:11.890> it's<00:02:12.040> kind<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.280> hard<00:02:12.490> to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
ground the coil and it's kind of hard to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.520 
ground the coil and it's kind of hard to
see<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.030> black<00:02:13.330> wire<00:02:13.600> coming<00:02:13.630> from<00:02:14.110> over

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
see but the black wire coming from over

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.880 
see but the black wire coming from over
here

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
here

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.430 
here
goes<00:02:15.580> all<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.820> way<00:02:16.240> across<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:17.110> through

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
goes all the way across here through

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.570 
goes all the way across here through
this<00:02:17.500> tangled<00:02:17.860> mess<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.160> actually<00:02:18.400> comes

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
this tangled mess and actually comes

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.760 
this tangled mess and actually comes
directly<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.209> ground<00:02:19.390> right<00:02:19.959> over<00:02:20.170> here

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
directly to ground right over here

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.620 
directly to ground right over here
so<00:02:21.250> now<00:02:21.400> we've<00:02:21.610> got<00:02:21.760> electricity<00:02:22.330> coming<00:02:22.540> from

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
so now we've got electricity coming from

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.930 
so now we've got electricity coming from
the<00:02:22.900> magneto<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.530> sum<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.800> all<00:02:23.860> lectures<00:02:24.820> to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
the magneto to sum it all lectures to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.690 
the magneto to sum it all lectures to
come<00:02:24.970> from<00:02:25.330> Magneto<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> CDI<00:02:26.590> from<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
come from Magneto to the CDI from the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.330 
come from Magneto to the CDI from the
CDI<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> coil<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.350> then<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.770> coil<00:02:30.070> is

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
CDI to the coil and then the coil is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.920 
CDI to the coil and then the coil is
grounded<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:31.180> if<00:02:31.360> everything<00:02:31.720> is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
grounded and then if everything is

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.630 
grounded and then if everything is
proper<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.530> everything's<00:02:32.830> good<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.490> should

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
proper and everything's good you should

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.300 
proper and everything's good you should
get<00:02:33.700> spark<00:02:34.650> all<00:02:35.650> right<00:02:35.800> do<00:02:35.950> tall<00:02:36.190> are

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
get spark all right do tall are

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.800 
get spark all right do tall are
bypassing<00:02:36.970> we've<00:02:37.330> got<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.600> bit<00:02:37.720> of

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
bypassing we've got a little bit of

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.120 
bypassing we've got a little bit of
issues<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.230> doesn't<00:02:38.560> work<00:02:38.710> we<00:02:39.040> don't

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
issues this doesn't work we don't

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.800 
issues this doesn't work we don't
actually<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.640> switch<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.240> actual<00:02:40.600> still

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
actually have a switch this actual still

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.490 
actually have a switch this actual still
works<00:02:41.020> this<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:43.270> don't<00:02:43.990> know<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.230> any<00:02:44.350> of

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
works this is I don't know if any of

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.840 
works this is I don't know if any of
that<00:02:44.620> actually<00:02:44.980> works<00:02:45.190> headlice<00:02:45.610> doesn't

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
that actually works headlice doesn't

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.920 
that actually works headlice doesn't
work<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.120> don't<00:02:46.270> even<00:02:46.330> have<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.570> hood<00:02:46.750> so

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
work but we don't even have a hood so

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.410 
work but we don't even have a hood so
why<00:02:47.050> does<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.260> even<00:02:47.290> matter<00:02:47.910> all<00:02:48.910> right<00:02:49.090> let's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
why does it even matter all right let's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.530 
why does it even matter all right let's
take<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.600> spin<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:51.730> right<00:02:51.910> looks<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.180> we<00:02:52.390> got

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
take a spin all right looks like we got

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.590 
take a spin all right looks like we got
about<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:53.170> do<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.290> think<00:02:53.470> dandruff<00:02:53.800> or<00:02:53.950> snow

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
about what do you think dandruff or snow

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.420 
about what do you think dandruff or snow
yeah<00:02:55.600> half<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.900> centimeter<00:02:56.320> or<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.650> yeah<00:02:57.250> you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
yeah half a centimeter or so yeah you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.950 
yeah half a centimeter or so yeah you
should<00:02:57.580> we<00:02:57.670> get<00:02:57.760> more<00:02:57.970> about<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.330> time<00:02:58.540> but

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
should we get more about this time but

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120 
should we get more about this time but
we'll<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.320> make<00:02:59.440> do<00:02:59.590> with<00:02:59.620> what<00:02:59.830> we<00:02:59.920> have

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
we'll have to make do with what we have

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.080 
we'll have to make do with what we have
all<00:03:01.090> right<00:03:01.240> ready<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.990> go
