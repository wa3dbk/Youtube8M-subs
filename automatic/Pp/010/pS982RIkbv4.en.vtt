much<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.479> avoid<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:31.290> anti<00:01:32.220> natural

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
much not just to avoid this anti natural

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.899 
much not just to avoid this anti natural
effect<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.439> guess<00:01:34.500> those<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.460> not

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
effect so as you can guess those are not

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.810 
effect so as you can guess those are not
dupes<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.290> afford<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.610> my

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
dupes if you can afford this one this my

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.359 
dupes if you can afford this one this my
prep<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.140> also<00:01:40.590> great

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
prep and time this one can be also great

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.109 
prep and time this one can be also great
deal<00:01:42.409> but<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.829> said<00:01:44.250> don't<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
deal but like I just said don't use it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.980 
deal but like I just said don't use it
two<00:01:45.479> matches<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.530> few<00:01:47.159> dots<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.090> be

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
two matches really few dots and then be

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
two matches really few dots and then be
careful<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:50.189> well<00:01:50.579> blend<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.479> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
careful to really well blend so that it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
careful to really well blend so that it
can<00:01:51.840> make<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.409> most<00:01:52.649> natural<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.430> can

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
can make the most natural that you can

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.880 
can make the most natural that you can
because<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.299> obvious<00:01:57.890> if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
because it is really kind of obvious if

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.530 
because it is really kind of obvious if
I<00:01:59.130> compare<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.700> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I compare it to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.650 
I compare it to
tonight<00:02:01.050> prepon<00:02:01.410> fine<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.980> for<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> prices<00:02:03.150> I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.300 
don't know that it is a cheaper in the
USA<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> Mac<00:02:07.710> prep<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.070> prime<00:02:08.250> i

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
USA so for the Mac prep and prime i

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.780 
USA so for the Mac prep and prime i
think<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.880> was<00:02:09.000> about<00:02:09.330> 30<00:02:10.200> euros<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.130> for<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
think it was about 30 euros and for this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.980 
think it was about 30 euros and for this
one<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.660> lose<00:02:12.840> between<00:02:13.230> 10<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:13.890> 15

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
one I think you lose between 10 and 15

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.080 
one I think you lose between 10 and 15
euros<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.530> i<00:02:16.590> know<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.850> one

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
euros but i know that for this one

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.420 
euros but i know that for this one
unless<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.840> might<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.200> cheaper<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.860> US<00:02:20.190> i

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
unless it might be cheaper in the US i

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.310 
unless it might be cheaper in the US i
