00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
a good idea before making these
connections<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.619> add<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.009> bit<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
connections here to add a little bit of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
connections here to add a little bit of
dielectric<00:01:44.820> grease<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.630> dielectric<00:01:46.170> grease

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
dielectric grease the dielectric grease

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410 
dielectric grease the dielectric grease
we're<00:01:46.530> using<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.009> part<00:01:47.220> number<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.820> seven

five five there's two connection points
that<00:01:50.790> we'll<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> make<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.540> since<00:01:52.020> this

that we'll need to make here since this

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.380 
that we'll need to make here since this
vehicle<00:01:52.320> has<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> 7-way<00:01:53.280> connector<00:01:53.310> we'll<00:01:54.270> be

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
vehicle has a 7-way connector we'll be

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.610 
vehicle has a 7-way connector we'll be
able<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> tie<00:01:54.869> into<00:01:55.110> that

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.870 

we'll<00:02:01.620> also<00:02:01.770> need<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.400> other<00:02:02.580> end<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
we'll also need to take the other end of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.220 
we'll also need to take the other end of
the<00:02:02.970> wiring<00:02:03.150> harness<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.720> comes<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.110> the

that will line up before pushing the
connection<00:02:11.790> together<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:12.930> use<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> few

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
connection together well then use a few

secure up any excess wiring we're gonna

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.430 
secure up any excess wiring we're gonna
go<00:02:18.120> ahead<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.360> wrap<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.840> some<00:02:19.020> electrical
