00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.319
 Welcome to a new episode edible 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.219
 nature 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.469
 Today I want you the spruce 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.870
 From the point of view you can imagine yourself 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.719
 cook a delicious tea look us 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.939
 this conifer is closer to the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 You can find spruce almost everywhere 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.590
 the forestry this fast 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.050
 growing tree very often planted 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.570
 The spruce is a tree of the very 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 can become high 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.150
 Their bark is made up of many small ones 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.620
 flounder and is often overgrown with moss 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.809
 very often can also be hartz 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 discover 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.120
 The cones of the spruce look like that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.699
 first of the spruce are widely branched and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.720
 with pointed needles set the pieks 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.839
 If you touch her color is green 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.250
 also at the bottom around me 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.650
 I simply pick my own tea 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 the dome branches at the top of the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.290
 First off I'll give the next 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.439
 spruce needles pour a cup over them 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.760
 with hot water and leave the whole 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.760
 pull for about five minutes 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.400
 I like to drink a lot of it I give 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.770
 a whole handful of spruce needle 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.390
 directly into the pot in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.420
 this pot has the advantage that it 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.790
 the front of the spout has a sieve that is 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.890
 I can after many without me many 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.580
 needles in my class have this tea 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.740
 to pour directly are the five minutes 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:44.790
 just pass the needles 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:48.729
 the cup out my absolute favorite 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.170
 spruce needle that can love 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.290
 of course, every other conifer 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.720
 next to pine fir except for one 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.090
 There is a poisonous conifer that would be 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.540
 the yew and here I would like to heart 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.640
 lay 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.800
 please look in a tree or 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.259
 once plant these 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.210
 one and then maybe again 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.340
 in nature 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.520
 it is so that the yew in the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.980
 native forests here barely or almost 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.160
 not growing at all you can find the yew in 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.590
 Parks are also very popular on cemeteries 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.280
 but now often here in the forest on one 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.350
 to come across yew that happens rather seldom 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.720
 but as I said it is very toxic 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.000
 take a look at the picture 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.880
 coined and then you can from you 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.570
 all other conifers such a 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.670
 delicious tea cooking in the sense of wishes 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.140
 I give you a lot of joy in nature everything 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.140
 good bye
