00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.000
 Panasonic is strongly committed to hair 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.580
 system cameras 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.709
 This is the Panasonic DMC GM 6 and that is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 the latest offspring on budget line and 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.110
 is primarily intended for the film and the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 budgetary 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.710
 and I have to be pretty to withdraw 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.270
 with this panasonic dmc gf6 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.740
 compared to its predecessor is one 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.970
 in appearance children of something 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.080
 thicker and logger 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.690
 but mainly to do with the fact 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.860
 that he has a new tilting screen 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.020
 on the back it is also called 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.340
 once crystal clear and on top 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.960
 comeback 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.190
 the program wheel that gives you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.010
 easy soon after all those settings 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 can with the dmc gr5 this could only be one 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 link via touchscreen and found some 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 very forgiving people 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.600
 At the same time it is the Panasonic DMC G6 yet 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 always a very compact camera anyway 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.390
 good in than light thanks to this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.829
 plastic grip 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 You have the idea that you do have a camera 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 stuck oh and the flash that just sticks 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 nice looking 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 already a little bit you ask one 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 list with specifications the dmc g6 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 has a 16 megapixel sensor that is over 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.700
 strong compared to its predecessor 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.430
 have improved window production 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.049
 moreover, it can film in full hd and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 there you can do it completely manually 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.970
 that is very nice and not unimportant 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.390
 he has lots of new ones 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.010
 communication technologies 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.640
 for example to wifi and down field 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.409
 communication also called nfc 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.140
 on this panic dmc there is now one 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.130
 standard lens kit from 14 to 42 mm 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 screwed 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.490
 that in itself is a basic lens you there 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 with their little big cloth and a little 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 sweet but yes it is actually a bit 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.860
 a mixed bag 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.439
 so better card there is a nicer lens 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.520
 screw up and then you just have something 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.140
 better effect 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 nothing about the image quality 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 then certainly praise at higher iso values 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.470
 You really see that the Panasonic are working 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.390
 did well I sometimes think so 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.070
 the sharpness is somewhat lacking 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 especially if an object moves a little 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.549
 van is quickly out of focus 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.960
 that is a bit unfortunate but in terms of color 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.850
 contrast is already perfectly fine 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.350
 go to the highest iso value 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 photographing yes then you will notice that 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 details are lost but a lot 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.689
 Noise there it just gets all 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.820
 a little vague when you go out of it 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.409
 engraving with the panama dmc gs is then 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.819
 you notice that it is indeed very nice 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.739
 you want the program back on 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.390
 the camera is therefore smith you really 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.550
 fast between settings 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.400
 I found that really much easier of course 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.709
 panasonic has this room over it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.150
 packed with creative filters 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.950
 really record it and there are 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.870
 some one liked but some 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.590
 or to wear or from 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.590
 us 9 every day 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.970
 oh how nice the tilting screen is too 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.709
 really a nice addition just a pity 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.750
 is that it is not fully rotatable 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.989
 is so you can only get such a beautiful one 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.310
 such a photograph but not so yes 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.079
 hinge is otherwise reasonable 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.810
 Firmly we must of course talk about it 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.879
 the movie function of dmc gf6 well you can 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.650
 completely manual film that is really one 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.909
 handy addition where you notice the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.040
 color contrast where the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.290
 very good but sometimes the sound one 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.959
 bit shrill and that is an extra pity 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.670
 detour the fact that you don't 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.109
 external audio can add that is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.170
 a little missed 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.489
 The DMC G6 has both WiFi and NFC 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 well the latter you do not go fast 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.090
 to use it is just something too 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.069
 cumbersome to take photos 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.239
 first to your smartphone and then to you 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.200
 to send a computer 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.420
 moreover, not all of them 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.069
 Smartphones also nfc so 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.569
 I rather think that now is a crazy crazier 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.680
 feature is then what you actually go 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.599
 use 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.919
 WiFi is functional thanks to it 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.209
 good job and the touch screen is it 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.069
 easily send photos to 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.329
 all kinds of social media or it 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.980
 send by email 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.410
 all this gives this camera a score 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.180
 of 4 stars on bna looking for one 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.590
 good working system camera for no 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.409
 too much money 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.840
 The camera currently costs 550 euros then 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.930
 the Panasonic DMC G6 is definitely something for 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.930
 you 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.430
 on photo
