00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 the heat awakens its singing that is 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 becomes more intense as the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.200
 temperature choose to be heard 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.179
 especially at nap and cicada or 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.360
 chicharra as it is said to our zone 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.730
 it does not go unnoticed during the summer and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.039
 it's only silenced by storms or 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.800
 the arrival of the cold there are more than a thousand 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 500 species of cicadas and they are not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.240
 considered a plague though dozens of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.130
 they can congregate in spaces 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.130
 small as the hollows of trees 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 its squeaky song multiplies until 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.900
 become an overwhelming buzz 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.239
 when it is produced at the same time percent 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.370
 of these insects sing in the trees 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.010
 from my house and the next day it's hotter 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.890
 and for the kids the area goes out so that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.650
 the goblin cited that for the nap to me 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.260
 It does not bother me I love it I love the 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.269
 noise from the buzzer and quad to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.300
 where I saw them in the trees of my 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.519
 house both the summer one but the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 human ears this sound seems 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.140
 always the same the truth is that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.410
 they use different tones to express 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.570
 alarm or to attract females the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.700
 Chicharras are also famous for their 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.490
 tendency to disappear for years 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.340
 to reappear with vigor at intervals 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.270
 regular are the periodic cicadas 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.580
 that emerge from the earth every 17 years 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.830
 others are known as annual cicadas 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.110
 because although the life cycles 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.440
 of the individuals are several years 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.020
 some adults appear annually 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.000
 canicular cicada appears every year to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.960
 half of summer is that I remembered 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.720
 They never went 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.909
 and what time do they make their noise in the afternoon 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.010
 and in the morning to mid morning when 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.790
 it is very hot what it means for 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.310
 you explaining heat 30 35 degrees 35 and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
 medium and with that clear attitude they go 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.619
 dissipating that it will be more heat me if 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.869
 the noise bothers him no I do not know I do not know if 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.360
 I enjoy but it does not bother me 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.360
 cicadas are part of the order of the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 monteros and are physically characterized 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.520
 for their robust bodies wide heads 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920
 Transparent membrane wings and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 big eyes but because they sing the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.500
 chicharras the male insect is the one 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.650
 sing and his musical organs are 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.050
 located on both sides of the abdomen this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.290
 allows you to sing and feed yourself 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.600
 time the more they sing more females 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.310
 they summon their life cycle begins 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 when the female lays eggs in 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.709
 hollows of stems or bark of 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 plants the larvae hatch in autumn and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.750
 they transform into nymphs they sink into 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.989
 the earth and absorb the sap from the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.890
 roots when spring arrives they leave 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.770
 the earth 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.440
 they ferran to the branches there await the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.300
 moment to leave the life of the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.390
 cicada extends for four or five 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.440
 weeks and leave as their legacy their 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.440
 unforgettable singing 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.170
 if I win 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.709
 after one 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.709
 fat woman 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.870
 same as survivor
