00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.770
 soon see someone who is breathing on the street 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.290
 into the smartphone can become commonplace 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.000
 in the near future mobile phone 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.889
 can be used as a personal 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 breathalyzer for determining the content 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.089
 blood alcohol people in this bar 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670
 check how the new meter works 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.650
 concentrations of volatile substances first and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 world's smallest multi-pixel 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 sensor chip for high-tech 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 sensors that are being tested in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 The phone was designed by andre art dota 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 and his vision department bend her 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.550
 an index and we promise to be an ounce 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 our task we see so transform 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.390
 smartphones in measuring devices for 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 volatile substances that are relevant 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 to human life alcohol 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.129
 this is just one example of this 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.899
 Start 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.050
 future we will see a wider 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.050
 use of such sensors come on i 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 do next 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.500
 microprocessor manufactured by 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.629
 sensor he is a former spin-off higher 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 Zurich Technical School works here 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.219
 600 people she specializes in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 component development for sensors goal 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.579
 companies to sell sensors 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.320
 manufacturers of smartphones tablets and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 other devices that would have them 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 integrated into their products cost 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.299
 one sensor is about one 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.220
 dollar 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.750
 this kind of microchip is becoming not only 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.600
 cheaper but most importantly less 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 here are the sensors of different generations, these three hundred 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.869
 pieces appeared on the market 6 years ago 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 but in this flask we have the same 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.380
 number of sensors only new 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.470
 generations that is what is called 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.100
 feel the difference 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.079
 using the smartphone as a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.299
 Alcotester made possible some 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.340
 time ago thanks to the application but 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.920
 built-in phone function breathalyzer 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 never had wide demand for a smartphone 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.460
 with such a function is almost guaranteed 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 However, the police say that the sensors 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.799
 can do a lot of harm and using 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 breathalyzer man will navigate 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.390
 on its rate it is very dangerous if 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.890
 you will be stopped by the police your level will be 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.329
 higher than 05 ppm 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.189
 then you cannot appeal to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.890
 test results or background as 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.049
 it is legally unreasonable into account 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.810
 accepted indicator is obtained after 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.610
 measurements by the police but an expert on 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.890
 digital technology peter bachmann says 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.180
 that similar sensors have more potential 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.680
 than just content definitions 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.079
 alcohol 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.459
 I can not imagine that everyone will 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.310
 use such a sensor to measure 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.379
 the alcohol level of course would be great 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.950
 if it were used to prevent 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.200
 road accident 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.629
 but I see more sensor potential in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.909
 air analysis areas for example not bad 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.370
 it would know how many fingers are in the air and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.200
 what is its chemical composition it would become 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.219
 great help for people suffering 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.219
 from allergies
