few simple techniques you can use on a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.120 
few simple techniques you can use on a
lot<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> fresh<00:00:21.390> fruit<00:00:21.630> drinks<00:00:22.020> when<00:00:22.980> you're

lot of fresh fruit drinks when you're

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
lot of fresh fruit drinks when you're
using<00:00:23.250> citrus<00:00:23.910> which<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.330> very<00:00:24.570> important

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
using citrus which is very important

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
using citrus which is very important
ingredient<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.529> these<00:00:25.830> cocktails<00:00:26.400> try<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
ingredient in these cocktails try to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
ingredient in these cocktails try to
remove<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.720> much<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.080> possible<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> white

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
remove as much as possible of the white

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.209 
remove as much as possible of the white
part<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> peel<00:00:30.240> before<00:00:31.019> crushing<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.070> or

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
part of the peel before crushing it or

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.389 
part of the peel before crushing it or
modeling<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.290> case<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.920> insides

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
modeling it so in this case the insides

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
modeling it so in this case the insides
of<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.730> citrus<00:00:36.420> fruits<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> case<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
of my citrus fruits in this case the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.160 
of my citrus fruits in this case the
lime<00:00:37.530> also<00:00:38.040> has<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> white<00:00:38.730> part<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.899> cut<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
lime also has the white part so cut it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.540 
lime also has the white part so cut it
out<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:40.860> better

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
out that's better

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
out that's better
next<00:00:42.510> important<00:00:42.930> step<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.829> cut<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
next important step is to cut it in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.270 
next important step is to cut it in
triangles<00:00:45.289> triangles<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> best<00:00:46.860> shape

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
triangles triangles are the best shape

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.330 
triangles triangles are the best shape
and<00:00:47.489> size<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.690> extract<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> fruit<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and size to extract the fruit and the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
and size to extract the fruit and the
juice<00:00:50.550> without<00:00:51.510> getting<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
juice without getting as much as a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
juice without getting as much as a
pitcher<00:00:52.860> flavor<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.370> cut<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.760> half<00:00:53.879> like

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
pitcher flavor so cut it in half like

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
pitcher flavor so cut it in half like
that<00:00:54.199> one<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.129> fill<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that one time like so and fill your

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.590 
that one time like so and fill your
glass<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.980> around<00:00:59.129> halfway<00:00:59.480> you<00:01:00.480> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
glass up it's around halfway you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
glass up it's around halfway you can
stick<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.170> rule<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:01.710> even<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
stick with this rule because even with a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
stick with this rule because even with a
larger<00:01:03.059> glass<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:04.260> different

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
larger glass you can use two different

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.710 
larger glass you can use two different
recipes<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.189> basically<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> halfway<00:01:06.330> full

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
recipes so basically in a halfway full

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.230 
recipes so basically in a halfway full
you<00:01:07.290> never<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.680> wrong<00:01:07.790> next<00:01:08.790> important<00:01:09.210> step

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you never go wrong next important step

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.990 
you never go wrong next important step
will<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.780> sugar<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:11.130> course<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.549> balance<00:01:11.850> out

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
will be sugar of course to balance out

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.630 
will be sugar of course to balance out
this<00:01:12.210> dis<00:01:13.110> sourness<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> cocktail<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this dis sourness of the cocktail and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.810 
this dis sourness of the cocktail and
also<00:01:15.509> during<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.680> crushing<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.430> muddling

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
also during the crushing or muddling

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
also during the crushing or muddling
you're<00:01:18.600> extracting<00:01:19.110> more<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> those

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you're extracting more of those

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.030 
you're extracting more of those
essential<00:01:20.400> oils<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> peel<00:01:22.200> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
essential oils that are in the peel so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.359 
essential oils that are in the peel so
when<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> muddle<00:01:23.490> push<00:01:24.390> turn<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
when you muddle push turn to get all the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.999 
when you muddle push turn to get all the
juice<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.330> crush<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> fruits<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.229> and
