I'm using and if you look down here what

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.770 
I'm using and if you look down here what
I'm<00:00:13.710> trying<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.429> mimic<00:00:14.849> these<00:00:15.330> designs

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
I'm trying to do is mimic these designs

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.800 
I'm trying to do is mimic these designs
so<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.949> see<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.430> whole<00:00:18.119> image<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.779> one

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so you can see it's a whole image on one

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
so you can see it's a whole image on one
side<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.619> we're<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> fold<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
side and we're going to fold it so that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
side and we're going to fold it so that
it<00:00:21.330> makes<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> other<00:00:21.840> side<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.560> hopefully<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
it makes the other side and hopefully it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.720 
it makes the other side and hopefully it
comes<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.420> like<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.369> what<00:00:26.369> I've<00:00:26.490> got

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and I'm going to see if I can mimic this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.200 
and I'm going to see if I can mimic this
design<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.129> traced

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
design that I traced

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.619 
design that I traced
actually<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.989> sketched<00:00:49.800> fold<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> quickly

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
actually I sketched fold it and quickly

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
actually I sketched fold it and quickly
it's<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.559> great<00:00:52.820> so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's going to come out really great so

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's going to come out really great so
bear<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.120> me<00:00:54.360> while<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.940> these<00:00:56.940> other

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bear with me while I put on these other

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.779 
bear with me while I put on these other
colors<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.129> I've<00:00:59.250> done<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.760> just

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
colors and what I've done is I'm just

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.170 
colors and what I've done is I'm just
kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.359> following<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.649> same<00:01:01.890> design<00:01:02.340> over

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
kind of following that same design over

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.280 
kind of following that same design over
and<00:01:03.329> over<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:07.080> that's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and over so you can see here how that's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
and over so you can see here how that's
working<00:01:08.210> let<00:01:09.210> me<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.450> another<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.840> that's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
working let me get another one that's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.740 
working let me get another one that's
full<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> paint<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:11.820> sure<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.210> squeeze<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
full of paint make sure you squeeze the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.640 
full of paint make sure you squeeze the
paint<00:01:12.990> down<00:01:14.030> into<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.479> area<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
paint down into the little area for the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
paint down into the little area for the
paint<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> come<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.710> then

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
paint to come out right here and then

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.500 
paint to come out right here and then
you<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.860> squeeze<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.729> go

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.040 

that's<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:31.180> can<00:01:31.330> be<00:01:31.420> as<00:01:31.540> messy<00:01:31.750> as<00:01:31.930> you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
that's it you can be as messy as you

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.220 
that's it you can be as messy as you
want<00:01:32.170> because<00:01:32.860> whenever<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:34.000> fold<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.840> it's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
want because whenever you fold it it's

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.880 
want because whenever you fold it it's
all<00:01:35.560> going<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.040> flatten<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:38.170> it'll<00:01:38.620> make<00:01:38.740> this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
all going to flatten and it'll make this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.460 
all going to flatten and it'll make this
fantastic<00:01:39.730> design<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.960> such<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> cool

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
fantastic design this is such a cool

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.380 
fantastic design this is such a cool
technique<00:01:41.830> because<00:01:42.190> it's<00:01:42.430> all<00:01:42.700> your<00:01:42.880> own<00:01:43.060> and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.840 
technique because it's all your own and
no<00:01:44.080> two<00:01:44.140> designs<00:01:44.770> are<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:44.980> same<00:01:45.280> oh<00:01:45.520> you're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
no two designs are the same oh you're

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
it's at one of those surprise things too

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
so you always get this big aha at the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.510 
so you always get this big aha at the
end<00:01:53.200> because<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.680> have<00:01:53.860> no<00:01:53.980> idea<00:01:54.250> what<00:01:54.400> it's

end because you have no idea what it's

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.300 
end because you have no idea what it's
going<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.910> turn<00:01:55.390> out<00:01:55.600> looking<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:57.190> I

going to turn out looking like and I
really<00:01:57.340> like<00:01:57.790> limiting<00:01:58.360> just<00:01:58.630> two<00:01:58.900> colors<00:01:59.680> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
really like limiting just two colors I
