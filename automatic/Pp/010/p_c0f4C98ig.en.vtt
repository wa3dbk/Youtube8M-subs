00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.620
 hear then we are nothing nothing nothing 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.620
 The end of 2013 will start the 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.330
 2014 and I want to give you the best advice 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.790
 that I can give you girls so that 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.280
 start the year with the right foot 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.050
 do what they did this year 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.000
 basically that is the key to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.759
 all your purposes are achieved so that 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.199
 everything happens because New Year's Eve as 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.609
 we saw it in the whole program is this 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.650
 night where we do all the rituals 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.359
 to assure us that next year will 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.939
 to change our lives they put the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.190
 candles the red pants on the yellow 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.990
 because the ignore without love is not worth 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.550
 the girdle because we want to have money and 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.070
 love but not see us as caterpillars in the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 photos and we already do all this running 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.420
 with suitcases not everything to leave behind what 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.890
 bad talking about running with suitcases 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.890
 they are really things that shock me 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.300
 new seriously or what happens if you go out and 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.520
 when you go out you find your 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.900
 suitcases grab a back pack sales 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.690
 It goes around the block and come back 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.210
 ruled I'm going to go wet I'm not going to 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.680
 know the world you have to choose how 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.910
 very well what suitcases do you want because 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.490
 it's the same to travel to Argentina 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.499
 europe uses women complicates us 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.400
 I say really serve those rituals or 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.370
 is going to wake up 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.830
 but your ex- boyfriend was going to say as not 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.130
 idiot no glory use red shorts 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.130
 I'll call 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.400
 your boss is going to get up and say 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.200
 you know that we are going to promote the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.570
 glory because if I throw gold coins 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.479
 on the floor it's really going to work 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.979
 not what works, what does work is 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.659
 that you buy in your book of horoscopes 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.910
 you know this where they tell you all year 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.900
 how are you going to check it out month by month 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 because more women are 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.950
 lovely you are looking at the book and 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.150
 you're just going to the love part, I do not know 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.430
 money and the health of vale 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.009
 because if you have love then you are going to have 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.720
 money and health does not matter not the point 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.070
 is that you're there the sad thing is that in 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.110
 February we already forgot so it's that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.759
 make little notes and remember that in 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.020

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.780

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.399

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.130

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.959
