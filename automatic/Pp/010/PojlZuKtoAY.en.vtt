00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
or if you could think of that water as a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.670 
or if you could think of that water as a
not<00:03:25.580> water<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.180> uh<00:03:26.330> yeah<00:03:27.049> if<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.410> want<00:03:27.590> to

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
should keep how to short I guess I

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.610 
should keep how to short I guess I
shouldn't<00:04:40.190> really<00:04:40.250> ramble<00:04:40.880> on<00:04:41.000> after<00:04:41.420> this

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
but I will also be making a how to make

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.950 
but I will also be making a how to make
every<00:04:49.040> type<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.250> animal<00:04:49.490> follow<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.210> but

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
secret is if you're watching this video

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.910 
secret is if you're watching this video
you<00:04:54.770> just<00:04:55.040> use<00:04:55.700> thin<00:04:56.090> items<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.530> used<00:04:57.770> to

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
you just use thin items that you used to

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.820 
you just use thin items that you used to
breed<00:04:58.100> them<00:04:58.250> with<00:04:58.430> but<00:04:59.290> there<00:05:00.290> you<00:05:00.380> go
