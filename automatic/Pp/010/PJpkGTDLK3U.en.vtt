4th fret of the D string you strike it
with<00:03:35.230> your<00:03:35.440> pick<00:03:35.710> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:36.900> move<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.110> finger

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
pretty fast so you don't get much of the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.320 
pretty fast so you don't get much of the
first<00:03:43.900> note<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.760> get<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.910> lot<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
first note but you get a lot of the

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.720 
first note but you get a lot of the
second<00:03:46.750> no<00:03:49.470> ok<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.920> I'll<00:03:51.010> do<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.310> from<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.550> top

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
second no ok so I'll do it from the top

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.140 
second no ok so I'll do it from the top
again<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.900> first<00:03:53.830> riff<00:03:56.970> hears<00:03:57.970> from

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
again that that first riff hears from

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.070 
again that that first riff hears from
the<00:03:58.330> top<00:03:58.540> with<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.290> first<00:03:59.800> riff
