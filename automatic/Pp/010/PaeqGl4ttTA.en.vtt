00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.949
 for me the press and to integrate there is a girl who enters parliaments and 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.480
 the tradewinds of the establishment means getting involved in the life of the school 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.669
 to know from the inside is not there to be confused with the body 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:23.230
 teacher 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.509
 on pedagogy 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.720
 teaching is not there for that but font police since the 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.839
 third round the school was helped by year 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.980
 indeed a few years of service 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 in a sense it's another matter the earth is our intermediary 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.899
 we are not going directly the ways of action are a problem we will not talk 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.190
 especially of delegates this novel full whip 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.300
 to the direction apel of the school I think it's really me I do not think 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.909
 that it's really brought this little necessary link for that 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.129
 the three fountains the parents the parents understand the teachers and that 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.000
 everything works by grilling 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.370
 too much if we get things done because from one year to another justice 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 minors and that's good for children 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.890
 parents it may actually be that the military had been held at 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.890
 bottom what does it do beautiful things flat to go sartilly 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.650

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.240
 we European operations also reports disappointed 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 with this highlighting the limits of extracurricular operations every 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.680
 flat screens set prices that remain high 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 for trade 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 it's still good 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.930
 the charges have an exchange a sharing of experiences 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 in parentheses it's nice to talk about certain topics and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.200
 propaganda 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.070
 unfortunately, if it is true that the experience feedback of others discuss 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.370
 with other parents it is a great wealth 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.750

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:41.850
 not aware of China actually not know 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.329
 we have these social networks 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.959
 arts delegates about that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.780
 take a gap of 20 years 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.079
 and the 6 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.209
 ended up sparking questions dealing with a few questions the one that leads to 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.209
 all the same to avoid the transmission 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.109
 I knew nobody that allowed me to meet a lot 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.129
 fabulous encounters 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.529

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.219
 reflection of discussions and exchanged that I like and very 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.509
 honestly four years ago I did not think I could have done anything there 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.829
 but as we invest 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 finally we discover things that are great 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.809
