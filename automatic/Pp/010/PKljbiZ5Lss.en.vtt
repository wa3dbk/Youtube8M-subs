00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.790 
with the audience you performed shoulder
and<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.160> will<00:02:34.340> say

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
and it will say

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.830 
and it will say
they<00:02:35.070> only<00:02:35.250> think<00:02:35.580> you're<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.360> queen<00:02:36.510> they

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.339 

I<00:02:40.849> guess<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.629> were<00:02:41.720> sitting<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.200> throne

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
I guess you were sitting on the throne

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.690 
I guess you were sitting on the throne
at<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> end<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.950> thing<00:02:43.159> so<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.370> guess<00:02:43.549> it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
at the end of the thing so I guess it's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.309 
at the end of the thing so I guess it's
kind<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:43.879> a<00:02:43.970> fitting<00:02:44.269> word<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:44.900> also<00:02:45.049> want

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
to get into prints the leg lifts off the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.089 
to get into prints the leg lifts off the
top<00:02:47.629> of<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> routine<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.379> got<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> queen<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.010> we
