00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
that I read the first one last month and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.670 
that I read the first one last month and
I<00:04:07.670> really<00:04:08.060> really<00:04:08.330> enjoyed<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.080> follows

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
I really really enjoyed it it follows

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.190 
I really really enjoyed it it follows
our<00:04:09.950> main<00:04:10.190> character<00:04:10.730> who<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.570> dream<00:04:11.959> Walker

our main character who is a dream Walker

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.560 
our main character who is a dream Walker
which<00:04:12.980> basically<00:04:13.340> means<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.790> she<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.330> walk

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
which basically means that she can walk

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.509 
which basically means that she can walk
inside<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:15.290> other<00:04:15.470> people's<00:04:15.830> minds<00:04:16.070> but<00:04:16.400> the

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
unfortunate thing about all this is

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.039 
unfortunate thing about all this is
that<00:04:18.979> is<00:04:19.129> super-duper-duper<00:04:19.780> illegal<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.959> the
