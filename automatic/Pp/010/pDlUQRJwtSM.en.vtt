of social interaction and I think what

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.870 
of social interaction and I think what
Microsoft<00:00:35.020> is<00:00:35.200> doing<00:00:35.560> is<00:00:35.770> not<00:00:36.580> about

Microsoft is doing is not about

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.050 
Microsoft is doing is not about
reinventing<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.690> wheel<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.430> about<00:00:39.640> no

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
reinventing the wheel it's about no

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.600 
reinventing the wheel it's about no
