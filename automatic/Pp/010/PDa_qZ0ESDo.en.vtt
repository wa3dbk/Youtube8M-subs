00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.229
 Most 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:12.770
 adobe illustrator to 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.850
 A variety of tools are available that can be changed to a large number of applications 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.289
 It has been 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.679
 In fact, it is unique to the pen tablet behind these tools 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.079
 It corresponds to the operation 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.239
 If it is a mouse, it can reflect only with the specified strength 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.649
 With most intelsgi you can operate as you like 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:31.569
 is 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.710
 Let's introduce it in Thailand 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.970
 The first one is usually here 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.740
 It is a wrong tool 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.850
 Let's introduce the collaboration in a cut flower state 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.340
 It consists of these seven types of tools from this spring 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
 I support all people 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.539
 From this time this time 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.100
 You will see two 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.370
 The first left is Park Tool 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.150
 This of this tool 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.690
 Double click 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.970
 Mark Normal Option is up and detailed design is done 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.920
 This strength can be of interest to the state administration 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.600
 It is setting- 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.290
 With ema set to 30% 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.440
 here 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.280
 I would like to see it with a mouse 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.620
 Then to the mouse 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.320
 I will take it home 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 The interesting part of this tool is 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.610
 As you saw 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.370
 High this way to stretch like an object year 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.540
 It is an advantage that you can 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 The schedule has been returned to the original 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 Switch to the Internet 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.650
 And recently out of the window of the news, this time strength 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.530
 Use the pressure point instead of the mouse 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 Let's do it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.580
 If you do so 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.140
 I feel like this when I write it lightly 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.140
 I wonder if it is like this and remember 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 Is not it 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.590
 In this way it flexibly reflects one minute favorite strength 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.110
 can do 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.160
 Also, as you saw, in one stroke 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.569
 You can add strength 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.659
 In the case of the mouse, the strength is always constant, so different strengths 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.629
 If you want to 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.709
 It is necessary to display Bamboo City setting dialog 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.579
 But 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.579
 It looks like it's a great deal with this pen tablet 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.749
 Let's do the next continuing failure with high 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.399
 it's here 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.019
 It is through linkclu 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.839
 Double click 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:40.119
 Then I want to lose here and use 8.5 to control 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.289
 This pink blue regular prime minister is the art line of the object 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.489
 Fine Mr. can add such an effect 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.589
 I am 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:49.649
 lightly 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:50.999
 Track 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.489
 Water store and drag 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.569
 Let's do the British chemical fire extinguishing offer 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.179
 I want to drag lightly or drag on water 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.680
 High Reiko's street number of passes too 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.730
 The thing when it breaks down when it gets down 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.129
 It has become 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.119
 By the way, I have introduced you to here 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.930
 I played lively and continued 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.930
 This time I will specify after going to this object 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.329
 The other party receives one from the symbol of Eco 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.739
 I would like to select 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.469
 Let's go to the village in the state of selecting the prize 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.329
 it's here 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.329
 Symbol is a column 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:40.539
 By the way, there are many people who have been there before 8 tools 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.409
 I have a pen tablet such as pressure and angle everything 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.379
 Supports unique functions 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.580
 I would like to show you three of these from this time 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.519
 Now it is the first left this symbol spraycooldoubleclick 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.259
 If you do, you will be able to have a part with vibration 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.309
 This high out 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.469
 Strength 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.599
 why 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.099
 Do you offer? 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.589
 As you can see 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:10.669
 What kind of tablet does Hitachi say when Koide tilts? 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.419
 You can use your own controls 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.760
 Please select 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.639
 Total 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.239
 How to use is very easy 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 Light and quick 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.020
 I heard that it was a recollection track 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.340
 Discarded results are different, but the density is greatly changed 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.330
 I came 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.819
 Useful when studding with so many symbols 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.199
 It is a tool 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.229
 Then continue 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.590
 Next time here 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.979
 It is a symbol resizing tool 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.699
 Also do doubleclick 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.580
 I would like to set the background strength by writing pressure 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.470
 I can add strength in the same stroke 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.800
 But 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.020
 For example 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.780
 Changing Drag or Bath Drag or Light 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.009
 I want to track 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.689
 How high is it? The size has changed considerably 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.729
 right 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.210
 Well, let me introduce one last thing here. 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.129
 Symbol screen tool 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.340
 Do the same doubleclick 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.940
 Let's confirm the setting We will set in the house that demonstrates the strength 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.020
 I will 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.510
 This tool is very useful but adds transparency 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.509
 I can do it, I'm getting lighter 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.699
 It is a remembrance 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.379
 How long is it at the place where I strongly followed 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.479
 It has disappeared 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.580
 We just introduced the tool at the same time. 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.650
 All of them do not touch the path at all directly 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.970
 Because these people can control it 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.710
 It is very convenient 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.140
 Make use of the Residue 3 to help improve work efficiency 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.499
 Please give me
