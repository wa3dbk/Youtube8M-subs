00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:12.170
 it's difficult to see that there the problem is 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:15.460
 that has many of the games about 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.460
 how many points 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:27.080
 one is winning a point of 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.150
 exceed but but but is that if 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.590
 Veracruz loses one more it becomes the same 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.050
 that the thing is that it seems like one 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:41.140
 veracruz auto automatically this one put 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.140
 negative and morelia of each 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.510
 from Morelia also dance QuerÃ©taro and 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.300
 atlas atlante chiapas a day and it's 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.890
 go see there is the 9 we go there and take out 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:03.510
 together 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 veracruz veracruz veracruz by the way 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.690
 Cup is free the one you love 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 veracruz will not charge and ask 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.360
 password or nobody who arrives at 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.490
 stadium gets the membership of the 10 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.520
 will take points in the class 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.200
 by chiapas in 11 is the determinant 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 between veracruz and me the next day 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.659
 the most complicated is the square 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 where is the veracruz and jalisco 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 27 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.050
 veracruz points 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.000
 the rival of those three teams are them 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.490
 but I see it more solid at 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.040
 those to the other two and it's over 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.979
 to Marin and the effort did not last for three 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.880
 matches what you want intensity 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.880
 after the pressures that point that leaves 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 direct 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.570
 negative textiles atlante if atlantean and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.570
 what's wrong 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.540
 525 points has one 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.820
 mathematics and the week lost 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.360
 veracruz and win atlante the overflow 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.360
 campus 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.930
 tying or losing would stay up 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.780
 because Vera Cruz is already in negative 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.780
 more more more games played what point 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.780
 they were wrong 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:54.500
 to lead the team since he arrived and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.260
 they run and are more intense in 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.820
 amargo's of diego the other two 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.650
 matches are won by winning television 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.910
 and does more I think that seeing that one 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.570
 he needs to invent he needed 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.570
 play good
