00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.090
 there are some very 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.170
 important within any company 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.490
 but at the time they are more accurate 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.930
 More cells are going to say so more 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.590
 present in people 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.030
 I think the first one is the leadership 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 you have people who are working 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.649
 here you work for these people and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 Do you trust them? 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 then you know that they are great they 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.020
 those are there for the company 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.850
 keep growing as you go 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.039
 keep growing together then the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.860
 leadership is very important. 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.079
 for you to work for someone you 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.399
 trust that you respect 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 so for example microsoft 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.140
 although we have a known gentleman 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 like steve ballmer people do not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.250
 trust him because because he is a guy 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 very down on the floor but people look 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.939
 For you, it's nothing, this guy. 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.070
 represents nothing within the company tim 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.580
 cook is not a person who helped 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.170
 company to improve its practices 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.909
 then he's a guy who 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.100
 You're going to make me respect this guy. 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 your games and if for a person mit 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.970
 Attic of a myth 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.369
 so it's very easy for you to respect 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.740
 that person the other question is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.810
 confidence that you know the person 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 Is working with you the same? 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.860
 level that you and you can rely on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.170
 Her job will not ruin your 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.030
 I work a lot with people who work with 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.119
 that something like ah I'm doing 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.250
 here the best boss that is possible but 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.409
 with that guy doing a hardware 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 bum will mess up my boss and not 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.350
 Look, everybody works with the same 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.119
 Trust level 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.210
 I also think this is enough. 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 important in fact the most important 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.170
 is that there is a genius it recognizes the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.450
 potential of each person then you have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.750
 recognition of the potential of a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 person and get out of it the better right 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.970
 if you know that if that person 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.530
 for example he is good at finance in 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.600
 Statistic you're not going to put it to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.040
 to work 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.020
 were of numbers are not important 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.220
 because you will not be able to develop the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.130
 potential then you will not be able to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.200
 take the name the best then it is 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.720
 important in this area of 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.750
 rh is you finding the potential of 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.440
 person and this will depend on your child. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.030
 huh 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.680
 and how the project was a genius but he is 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.870
 an intuitive genius was a genius who 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.140
 he did things by intuition he did not 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.450
 had a one gender course 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.040
 he was alienated the people he knew 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.320
 that person had the best and he 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.980
 succeeded in extracting this from the person 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.710
 that's your big strength then 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.290
 it was the thing to look at the person and not 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.260
 just knowing what the potential is but knowing 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.460
 that person will withstand the pressure 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.290
 because you can extract the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.690
 best person have to press there 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.860
 you can not leave the guy sitting or 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.810
 network it will not be able to 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.410
 develop your potential then you 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.130
 you have to know how to press and how 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.990
 pressure to take away the potential 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.790
 best of the person so I think it 's this 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.640
 genius where you can know 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.110
 that you have to be strong but at the same time 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.490
 time you have to be affectionate so that the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.650
 Dude do not go either, so do not you 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.080
 It can be rude what young people do not 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.420
 he could do because he was a 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.880
 scoundrel many times but so is the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.070
 face that look so get you 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.850
 will succeed and the guy managed to 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.320
 cause of it 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.080
 today we talk about changing the world but 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 more sustainability issue of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.390
 make the world a better place to 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.970
 live in projects the question of living 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.860
 It was better to be able to do things 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.560
 best 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.570
 so if you have an iphone 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.520
 I mean you have a smartphone that 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.680
 go to the internet that has a 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.540
 application that will help you find 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.820

 transform the world and yes the world 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.180
 as a whole but is transforming the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.240

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.100
 You'll make things happen. 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.680

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.930
 world 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.910
 one keyboard at a time on your computer. 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.639

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.710
 you change people and people change 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.320
 the world then you in the world world 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.090
 alone you need help and how it is 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.280
 that you change people's lives 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.770
 you make their lives that more 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.139

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.180
 movies in your case if you need 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.070
 more of the tv you no longer need 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.139
 other things you watch there you have 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.229

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.910
 So that changed his life and his life. 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.130
 changed his life of several people 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.020
 changing the world is changing at the same time 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.259
 time then people change with 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.729
 attitudes do not give a time each day a 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.740
 step at a time 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.930
 the ipad is just was ready to be 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.449
 launched ten years after what was 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.310
 planned because people were 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.740
 still ready to understand that it is a 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.130
 idea and today the ipad is a great success 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.280
 so the important thing is that we will change the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.580
 world, let's go, calm down, let's change 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.070

 believe in it, we change the 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.400
 people around us is something of a 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 evangelization you will gradually 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.440
 changing people and then people will 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.010
 Growing things are changing and this thing is going 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.349
 yes entering into the person and is when 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.349
 you see the world is more the same
