00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.440
 They say Russian consumers know little about California wine. 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.800
 Meanwhile, California's wine-making traditions began in the eighteenth century, 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.880
 when Spanish missionaries introduced California to winemaking technology. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.320
 250 years of tradition and experience, perfect climate, improved technology 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.600
 make California one of the best places to produce high quality wines. 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.720
 July 20, the residence of the US Consul General in Vladivostok 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.360
 gathered guests for tasting Californian wines from the manufacturer ASV Wines. 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.120
 The reason for the presentation was the direct delivery of California wine 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.280
 from the US west coast to Vladivostok, which is rare for this region: 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.480
 Usually Californian wine arrives in the Far East through Moscow or St. Petersburg. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 Gathered at the invitation of the US Agricultural Trade Office 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 restaurateurs, representatives of retail chains and wholesale companies 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.000
 It was proposed to try and evaluate six varieties of Canyon Oaks wines: 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.760
 Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Shiraz, Zinfandel and White Zinfandel. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.040
 In order to evaluate each of the presented varieties of wine, the guests were asked to fill out the tasting sheets, 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.080
 giving an assessment of color, flavor, taste and overall impression. 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 Despite outward idleness, wine tasting is a rather difficult process. 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.400
 And, perhaps, a non-professional in such a complex matter requires a hint from a specialist. 

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:47.970
 Of course, it is better to prepare any wine tasting for yourself theoretically for a start. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.960
 That is, you need to study which wine you will taste, from which grape variety, from which country it comes from. 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.800
 And at least read a little about it. 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.040
 Because the hotter the country, the more temperamental the wine will be. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.320
 The more to the north are the vineyards, the more restrained it will be. 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.080
 and he needs more time to open up. 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.440
 The main recommendation for beginners in tasting is, of course, to try varietal wines. 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.200
 That is, when the wine contains not several grapes, but some one. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.160
 The second part of this tasting will be very revealing if you try the wine of the same grape variety, 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.360
 but from another country or from another region of the same country. 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 And the second rule, which is very important when tasting. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.600
 It is always to fix everything in a notebook, you always need to write down what you are trying. 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.240
 Despite the difficulty, the guests coped with the task. 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.960
 In addition, each made his own picture of the perception of a particular variety. 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.840
 Considering the current preference in Russia for sweet and semi-sweet wines, dry, 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.360
 guests have suggested that the semi-sweet white Zenfandel 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.800
 definitely will find its demand from the local consumer. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.600
 Nevertheless, the varieties of semi-dry wines are also impressed by the complexity of the flavor, 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.000
 the brightness of the bouquet, the elegance of taste. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080
 According to the participants of the tasting, proposed California wines 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.640
 may well occupy a certain niche in the local market, given the good price-quality ratio. 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.600
 We hope that due to the greater availability of Californian wine for residents of Vladivostok and the entire Far Eastern region 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.160
 the wish of Patricia Miller, the acting US Consul General, will become a reality: 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.920
 Let every time a California wine gives you a piece of the Californian sun!
