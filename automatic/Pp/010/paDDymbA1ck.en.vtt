00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello today I want to show you how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.519
 to cover for a cool ride 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:31.230
 make pies and cake 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:39.200
 Letters and needed two simple 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.200
 There are rides in the trade 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.250
 You can already get the chocolate to the city 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250
 into the gate 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:43.250
 whether the chocolate cut the smaller also 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:46.500
 or you just invite yourself 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.509
 For a cake I use chocolate 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.229
 Little always wants to happen like that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.229
 small cafe 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.789
 the chocolate inside 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.319
 that can easily play for half an hour 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.830
 then let the total liquid 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.179
 beautiful on the cake brushing 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.340
 when we created our chocolates 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.810
 we still need something to do 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.270
 happened is very important in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.800
 cut different sizes because we 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.750
 our users are waiting for you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.770
 solid support either we here on 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.390
 cutting boards baking sheet a solid 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.300
 We also simply cover cardboard 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.340
 or a tray what you have at home 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:37.980
 and since we do then the pattern on 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:40.440
 once chocolate soft and then that 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.620
 was sprit dry make a kitchen towel 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.890
 otherwise our doubt dripping onto the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890
 Switzerland 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.099
 very carefully read here 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.160
 We are now doing our patterns 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.569
 or our names what we call decor 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:16.750
 want to have and that goes for a corner 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.430
 and is cautiously still a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.760
 a bit bigger the distance because of you 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.530
 [Music] 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.500
 What we do not like it strikes is then 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.130
 You can do that later again 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.550
 cut off the cold lettering 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.550
 do 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:29.480
 There you can do it quietly two three 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.480

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:09.940
 I do not want to use points 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.250
 very quickly that is very cheap 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.250

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:29.770
