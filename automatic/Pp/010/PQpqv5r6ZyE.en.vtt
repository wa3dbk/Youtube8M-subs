00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
never thought I'd say that i was

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.330 
never thought I'd say that i was
expecting<00:04:09.440> him<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.860> little<00:04:10.010> bit<00:04:10.160> pause

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
expecting him to be a little bit pause

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.820 
expecting him to be a little bit pause
expecting<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.300> speed<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.080> be<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.230> huge<00:04:12.620> problem

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
expecting the speed to be a huge problem

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.610 
expecting the speed to be a huge problem
but<00:04:13.280> he<00:04:13.400> really<00:04:13.790> isn't<00:04:13.940> i'm<00:04:14.900> not<00:04:15.140> entirely

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
but he really isn't i'm not entirely

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.349 
but he really isn't i'm not entirely
sure<00:04:15.800> what<00:04:16.190> his<00:04:16.310> strength<00:04:16.609> is<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:16.850> should<00:04:17.090> have

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
sure what his strength is I should have

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.960 
sure what his strength is I should have
checked<00:04:17.570> but<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.590> has<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:18.890> be<00:04:19.100> high<00:04:19.310> because<00:04:19.520> he

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
checked but it has to be high because he

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.099 
checked but it has to be high because he
was<00:04:20.120> shrugging<00:04:20.359> off<00:04:20.540> some<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.959> big

i thought there was it was actually

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.870 
i thought there was it was actually
really<00:04:48.740> good<00:04:48.919> i<00:04:48.980> mean<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:49.250> one<00:04:49.370> goes<00:04:49.520> in<00:04:49.730> on

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
really good i mean that one goes in on

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.360 
really good i mean that one goes in on
the<00:04:50.360> inside<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.169> crossbar<00:04:51.590> but<00:04:52.250> that's

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
the inside of the crossbar but that's

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.740 
the inside of the crossbar but that's
what<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.580> mean<00:04:52.760> every<00:04:53.090> single<00:04:53.210> shot<00:04:53.540> just

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
what I mean every single shot just

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.780 
what I mean every single shot just
seemed<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.050> hit<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.530> post<00:04:54.740> cross<00:04:55.220> bar<00:04:55.490> or

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
seemed to hit the post cross bar or

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.090 
seemed to hit the post cross bar or
something<00:04:56.480> like<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:56.810> but<00:04:57.139> that<00:04:57.889> was<00:04:58.010> with

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
something like that but that was with

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.530 
something like that but that was with
his<00:04:58.250> week<00:04:58.430> for<00:04:58.700> as<00:04:58.790> well<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:58.970> think<00:04:59.090> he<00:04:59.389> has

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
his week for as well I think he has

freestyle<00:05:00.110> week<00:05:00.290> for<00:05:00.560> but<00:05:00.980> that's<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.310> huge<00:05:01.580> lie

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
freestyle week for but that's a huge lie

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.150

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
as well it's his passive of his weak

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.560 
as well it's his passive of his weak
force<00:05:04.400> just<00:05:04.669> as<00:05:04.790> good<00:05:04.910> as<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.060> shooting<00:05:05.450> of<00:05:05.540> his

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
force just as good as a shooting of his

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.740 
force just as good as a shooting of his
week<00:05:05.780> for<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.110> it's<00:05:06.260> just<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.800> good<00:05:07.040> and<00:05:07.750> I'm
