00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:08.000
There is an Arab proverb that says the following:
If you do not have internal enemies, no

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.509
foreign enemy can hurt you.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.750
People have their lives governed by
habits and habits can be interior friends

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.260
or invisible and internal enemies, as
we know the worst kind of enemy is the one

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.170
you can not see.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:56.410
I am Ivan Maia and this is another seed
Life.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.670
What are the habits that govern your
life?

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.380
As a child and without realizing of course,
you started building habits, you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.620
I knew everything that the human being does
for ten consecutive days tend to become

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.620
An habit?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.270
And that after forming a habit there is only
a way to lose this habit?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.080
The only way you lose and destroy
a habit is putting in place another in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.400
my course and also book The Fine Art of Dealing
with People I talk about it, for example,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.450
there are people who have the habit of criticizing
and the only way to lose this habit

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.860
to criticize is putting in his place otherwise,
which is the act of praise or validate people,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.140
It is very important that you understand that.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.830
What are the habits that govern your
life?

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.250
Most people are ruled by habits
and as I said habits are enemies

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.350
invisible and indoor and these enemies
They are terrible, catastrophic for your

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.810
life because they hide and you do not
You realize them.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.820
And hide them in your subconscious
can undermine your success, your joy

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.120
live, all the positive results you
wants and lead you to a life of failure

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120
and destruction.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.200
Most people have their lives governed
by negative habits and live prisoners

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.320
the shackles of failure and they do not get
of that, they just do not realize

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.890
this is happening.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.550
Of course, if you notice that something is you
destroying immediately you tend to change,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.080
but the big problem is when you do not
and realize most people live slaves

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.240
terrible habits, destructive habits.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.580
Habits like: Procrastination (leave everything
for another day), discontinuation of habit

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.069
(Start something and not finish), habit
be irritated by little, hardly speak of habit

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.630
of others, to raise the voice habit
and shout, habit of being rude harsh

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.560
and thick, habit of frowning, habit
having bad mood, sleep too much, talking too much,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.070
hear from least habit of meddling in
things of others, habits of asking questions

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.760
cretins and imbeciles.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.150
You know what a stupid question and
asshole?

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.500
It is an invasive question, out of context,
an inopportune question and what have people

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.790
so the world is awesome, habit
of late, this is a terrible habit

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.540
and most people have.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.540
You know that there are destructive habits
and builders habits, empowering habits

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.390
and disempowering, we can use as an example,
two or three of these habits that I just

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:04.281
to mention that is where most people
They fail, for example, the habit of overeating

00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:11.990
and ignore the digestive tract needs
4-5 hours to make the digestive process

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.040
normal and rest.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.130
Imagine that you turn your car and walk
with him 24 hours a day every day and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.010
that night when you go to sleep you
leave it with the engine running in neutral

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.780
garage, how long do you think it would last
your engine?

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.260
So happens with the human body, you
I know that there are people who eat one

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.380
once a day?

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.270
Yes, they start at five in the morning and go
until midnight eating nonstop, brains

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.910
are weak, they are obese and emporcalham
his blood.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.720
There is also late arriving habit,
this habit that here in Brazil is very common,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.370
people set the time and did not arrive
on time, here in Brazil I've been

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.889
in places where they told me it was better
advertise in the brochure of the event, for example,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.810
which began at 19h00min so we could
begin 20:00 because there's always the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.199
people arriving late, ie the
Instead of the dog wagging the tail is the tail

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.070
that is wagging the dog.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.270
And another very common habit is promise
yourself and do not deliver what it promised.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.240
When you promise things yourself and not
stick you lose confidence in you and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.139
when you lose confidence in yourself,
no one will trust you because if

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.800
not even you trust yourself as others
You can trust?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.690
Eliminate negative habits in your life,
review which the habits that have governed

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.199
your life and remember as I said at the beginning
that the only way to get rid of a habit

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.860
It is putting in place another.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.970
Make a list of the three most negative habits
and destroying what you have and make a commitment

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:09.130
I can even put in their place, three
habits also builders and will eliminate,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.580
because as Mark Twain wrote: We can not
get rid of a habit simply taking it out

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.710
through the window; you need to make it down the
ladder rung by rung.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.900
It's a little work, a little each day,
but most people are worried

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.139
thereby?

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.139
Do not.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.850
Fools, imbeciles and idiots even know
I'm talking about, because they have a

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.479
most terrible habit that everyone who is
habit of being dumb.

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:44.210
Exit multitude; Be different; exit
flock, because if you mix it will

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.690
end in the same place where everyone ends
and the herd always end in the slaughterhouse

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.680
failure and unhappiness.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.889
Your life is passing you by quickly,
do something while there is still time.

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:28.560
Worth UNUSUAL.
