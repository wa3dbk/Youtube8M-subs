00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 since we are collecting a new bike 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 put on him and new tires 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.429
 I take off the old tire most 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.429
 modern tires can be removed manually 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.539
 if it cannot be removed with hands, use 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.570
 assembly key we take out the camera we remove 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.150
 tires at the same time it is worth checking the tape 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.170
 rim make sure it is located along 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.600
 the center of the rim and closes all not beat that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.200
 it is not damaged anywhere on this tape 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 water 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.379
 i'm driving moisture with my fingers like this now 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 everything is ready new tire most 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.260
 tires sent check side marks 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.660
 they will tell you where to put on a tire 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.800
 forward or backward 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 I can give personal advice on the side of the tire 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.989
 there is a color label always insert it 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.160
 where the valve is if you need urgently 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.830
 change tire 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.060
 don't have to look for a valve you will see 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.080
 put a tire on a tire 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.080
 wear half the rim 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.010
 new camera 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.490
 be sure to check and make sure that 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.110
 there is no pollution 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 enough pair of glass or stone 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.180
 under the tire and you immediately get a puncture 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:43.190
 we insert the valve check that the camera 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.380
 was partially pumped in it should be 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.440
 some air you might notice that 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.560
 good quality cameras usually 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.420
 handled with talcum when camera 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.750
 processed outside with talcum powder 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.520
 stick to the inside of the tire 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.520
 sometimes you can handle the camera yourself 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.410
 I can tell you how to do it better 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.130
 i move in a circle in the direction 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.610
 valve last piece of tire 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.370
 gotta get up easy and last tip 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.310
 correct the valve push it in 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.200
 tire and then pull again and if 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.870
 he goes tight so as not to hurt 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.880
 valve when you fix it this 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 tire we set easy but some 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.370
 heavy tires sit much denser 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 they are difficult to quickly put on from the hem in such 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.320
 if you find it difficult to deliver 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.190
 last tire patch can be made 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.580
 so turn the valve down roll 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.880
 tire sealing it in a circle and then in 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.400
 expel all surplus valve where its 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.650
 and you need to wear roll it shifting on 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.950
 rim and then last to participate 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.320
 easy to put in place some put 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.239
 tires with the wrench but 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.010
 the edge is usually damaged 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.560
 the rim is therefore always best to wear 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.500
 tires hands key is suitable to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.840
 take off tires I donâ€™t wear them 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.060
 I advise by the same principle 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.550
 remove heavy tire freedom if 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.290
 tire there and can be removed with difficulty 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.870
 also ride and and trying to achieve 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.810
 loosening on one stretch to her 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.880
 take off the chase and and if one 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.200
 also the key does not help you 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.810
 use two or three 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.790
 better to use synthetic keys 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.920
 our time they are very strong 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.190
 metal can severely damage 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.550
 omate i usually recommend shooting 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.120
 quality plastic tires 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.120
 keys
