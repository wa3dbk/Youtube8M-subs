00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Choosing a digital camera may be difficult because there are many cameras to choose from 

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.001
 But what is essential is that you buy a camera to use 

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.002
 There are many things to keep in mind when choosing your camera 

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.003
 But the first question you should ask yourself is what the camera wants to do 

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:23.004
 These days the megapixel is not the most important factor because it is in all cameras enough to do what you want 

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.005
 Now let's take a look at the different types of cameras 

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:31.006
 Eltrasalm cameras are specially designed to be easy to carry 

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:35.007
 Can be easily placed inside the handbag or inside the pocket 

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:39.008
 They are great for traveling and touring within cities 

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:45.009
 These cameras are easy to use and give consistent results every time 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 It operates automatically 

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.011
 Just direct them and take the picture 

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:56.012
 It will give you a picture of a higher quality and much better than what you might get from a mobile camera 

00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:57.013
 Advanced Point &amp; Shoot Cameras 

00:00:58.015 --> 00:00:59.015
 Advanced Point &amp; Shoot cameras like this camera 

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:07.016
 Features manual control and is the second choice after DSLR cameras 

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:11.017
 You can always keep them in your bag as a backup camera you may need 

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:17.018
 It is good for anyone who wants to control the camera's properties as they give many manual control options 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 Digital cameras like this are waterproof cameras 

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:27.021
 Custom-made to meet difficult conditions while filming abroad 

00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:35.022
 They are not affected by rain, and many of them are anti-shock if they occur from you 

00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:36.023
 This will not cause any problems 

00:01:36.024 --> 00:01:42.024
 Cameras like this do not have to worry about them 

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:46.025
 Some of them provide high quality video capture 

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:51.026
 High-zoom cameras have lenses that cover the range at long distances 

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:55.027
 They generally have optical zoom at least 10 times wider 

00:01:55.028 --> 00:02:00.028
 This model with which I have optical zoom in more than 30 times 

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.029
 It's like having a telescope in your camera 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 Most of these cameras look close to DSLR cameras 

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:10.031
 But the lens itself is fixed and can not be changed 

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:15.032
 Tourists prefer this type of camera to cover a wide range 

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:19.033
 And lets you zoom the image as you want without having to change your location 

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:24.034
 It is good in case if you are in a group on a cruise ship it is not comfortable 

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:29.035
 Hybrids are smaller in size than DSLR cameras 

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:33.036
 But it contains a large synthesizer to give you a picture of amazing quality 

00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:35.037
 It is faster and more responsive than regular digital cameras 

00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:40.038
 It also works better in conditions where lighting is less than standard cameras 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:45.039
 The lens of these cameras is changeable, giving you better control over the images you want to capture 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 You can change lenses to get different effects 

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:53.041
 It's great if you're interested in photography and DSLR can not be purchased 

00:02:53.042 --> 00:03:00.042
 They are amazing for travel lovers who do not want to pack a lot of luggage but want to get a high quality image 

00:03:00.043 --> 00:03:06.043
 My DSLR experience is the best in taking pictures between all existing digital cameras 

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:11.044
 This is related to the size of the large synus inside 

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:18.045
 It also has a large optical selector that gives you greater control over the image you are taking 

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:24.046
 I am very impressed with the speed of taking pictures. All you have to do is click and you will get the picture easily 

00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:31.047
 It gives you great results in lower lighting conditions and is amazing in taking pictures of moving objects 

00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:36.048
 I think it's a good choice for parents to take pictures that contain motion 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 As well as wildlife photographers and anyone who wants to take photos in poorly lit places 

00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:46.051
 You should know that any camera will take good photos in daylight 

00:03:46.052 --> 00:03:52.052
 But if you want to take a lot of pictures in less light, you need to buy a hybrid or DSLR camera 

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:58.053
 You will take photos of your friends, relatives and loved ones if you like the camera you own 

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:01.054
 The best camera ever is the camera that you would prefer to bring with you everywhere 

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:07.055
