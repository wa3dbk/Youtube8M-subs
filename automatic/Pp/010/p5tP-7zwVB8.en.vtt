Ivan Castaneda was busting his butt to
get<00:04:55.050> down<00:04:55.229> there<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.669> good<00:04:56.820> thing<00:04:57.030> happened

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
get down there and a good thing happened

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.420 
get down there and a good thing happened
you<00:04:57.570> know<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:57.810> got<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.140> big<00:04:58.770> break<00:04:59.039> and<00:04:59.280> that
