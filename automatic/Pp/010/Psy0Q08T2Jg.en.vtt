00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.600 
wall Hickory down there maybe we'll have
them<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.619> top<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> wall<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> got

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
them do the top in the wall that I got

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.760 
them do the top in the wall that I got
lots<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.030> too<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:58.500> year<00:01:58.680> is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
lots of that too but this year is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
lots of that too but this year is
actually<00:01:58.950> pin<00:01:59.430> oak<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:01.759> it's<00:02:02.759> three<00:02:03.060> layers

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
actually pin oak and it's three layers

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.469 
actually pin oak and it's three layers
of<00:02:03.479> pin<00:02:03.780> oak<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.259> guess<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.399> ever<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:06.299> into

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
of pin oak I guess if we ever get into

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.399 
of pin oak I guess if we ever get into
like<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> revolutionary<00:02:07.649> style<00:02:07.979> war

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
like a revolutionary style war

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.660 
like a revolutionary style war
which<00:02:10.409> could<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.769> coming<00:02:11.129> by<00:02:11.249> the<00:02:11.310> way<00:02:11.609> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
which could be coming by the way you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.050 
which could be coming by the way you
never<00:02:11.819> know<00:02:13.219> that<00:02:14.219> thing<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.549> thick<00:02:14.760> enough<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
never know that thing is thick enough to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.690 
never know that thing is thick enough to
stop<00:02:15.239> two<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.749> three<00:02:16.019> bullets<00:02:16.489> they're<00:02:17.489> one

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
stop two to three bullets they're one

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.770 
stop two to three bullets they're one
inch<00:02:17.879> thick<00:02:17.969> and<00:02:18.980> they're<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.420> frickin

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
inch thick and they're this this frickin

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.089 
inch thick and they're this this frickin
door<00:02:21.930> weighs<00:02:22.139> hundred<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.650> couple<00:02:22.889> hundred

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
door weighs hundred a couple hundred

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.160

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
pounds a couple 300 pounds anyway and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.289 
pounds a couple 300 pounds anyway and
they<00:02:25.530> did<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.129> split<00:02:26.549> like<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.030> halfway

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
they did have it split like that halfway

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.410 
they did have it split like that halfway
so<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.959> we<00:02:28.109> could<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:29.280> know<00:02:29.370> swing<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.969> one

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
so that we could you know swing it one

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.039 
so that we could you know swing it one
way<00:02:30.540> or<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.750> other

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
way or the other

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
are not going to stay on there they will

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.129 
are not going to stay on there they will
wear<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.599> not<00:02:36.689> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> use

down<00:03:05.969> the<00:03:06.120> steps<00:03:06.359> we<00:03:06.510> go<00:03:06.689> they<00:03:06.930> got<00:03:07.079> short

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
down the steps we go they got short

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.649 
down the steps we go they got short
risers<00:03:07.889> because<00:03:08.340> older<00:03:09.060> people<00:03:09.090> will<00:03:09.540> be

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
risers because older people will be

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.659 
risers because older people will be
going<00:03:09.750> up<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.049> down<00:03:10.199> them<00:03:10.379> like<00:03:10.560> my<00:03:10.709> dad<00:03:10.919> and

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
going up and down them like my dad and

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.539 
going up and down them like my dad and

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
possibly my grandmother and for some

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.599 
possibly my grandmother and for some
reason<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.209> warmer<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:16.079> this<00:03:16.259> side<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.919> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
reason it is warmer on this side of the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.530 
reason it is warmer on this side of the
of<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.900> building<00:03:19.259> see<00:03:20.329> that's<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.509> other

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
of the building see that's the other

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.509 
of the building see that's the other
side<00:03:21.689> of<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.049> wall<00:03:22.199> but<00:03:22.439> I<00:03:22.889> don't<00:03:23.310> know<00:03:23.370> why

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
side of the wall but I don't know why

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.599 
side of the wall but I don't know why
this<00:03:23.579> side<00:03:23.939> feels<00:03:24.299> warmer<00:03:24.989> whether<00:03:25.949> it's<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
this side feels warmer whether it's the

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.990 
this side feels warmer whether it's the
garage<00:03:26.879> doors<00:03:27.479> there's<00:03:27.930> three<00:03:28.169> of<00:03:28.229> them<00:03:28.409> here

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
garage doors there's three of them here

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.369 
garage doors there's three of them here
you<00:03:30.000> just<00:03:30.150> want<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.419> let<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.720> know<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.169> this

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
you just want to let you know that this

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.409 
you just want to let you know that this
building<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.949> not<00:03:32.099> very<00:03:32.340> high<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.639> will<00:03:33.060> not<00:03:33.269> be

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
building is not very high I will not be

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.999 
building is not very high I will not be
bringing<00:03:33.629> tractors<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.439> here<00:03:34.620> maybe<00:03:34.799> the

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.009 
bringing tractors in here maybe the

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:39.170 
bringing tractors in here maybe the
antique<00:03:35.519> tractors<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.449> not<00:03:37.069> not<00:03:38.069> modern<00:03:38.489> big

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
antique tractors but not not modern big

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.189 
antique tractors but not not modern big
cam<00:03:39.629> trackers<00:03:40.169> they<00:03:40.290> just<00:03:40.500> won't<00:03:40.650> fit<00:03:41.009> so<00:03:41.519> oh

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
cam trackers they just won't fit so oh

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.960 
cam trackers they just won't fit so oh
that<00:03:43.199> being<00:03:43.409> said<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:44.009> think<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.609> buildings

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
that being said I think the buildings

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.449 
that being said I think the buildings
come<00:03:45.120> along<00:03:45.389> well<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:46.099> you<00:03:47.099> know<00:03:47.220> there's

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
come along well the you know there's

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.800 
come along well the you know there's
just<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.729> few<00:03:47.879> things<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.209> they<00:03:48.359> really<00:03:48.629> have

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
just a few things that they really have

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.990 
just a few things that they really have
to<00:03:48.959> do<00:03:49.109> before<00:03:49.319> it's<00:03:49.709> finished<00:03:49.889> up<00:03:50.280> and

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
to do before it's finished up and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.149 
to do before it's finished up and
