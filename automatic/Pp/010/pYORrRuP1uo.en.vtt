00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 Psalm 38 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.270
 Jehovah does not give me clothes in your fury nor 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.250
 You punish me in your anger because your arrows 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.490
 they fell on me and on me has 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.950
 your hand descended 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.470
 nothing and healthy in my flesh because of your 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.960
 anger or there is peace in my bones because of 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.150
 my sin because my iniquities have been 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.300
 aggravated over my head as a burden 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 heavy have been aggravated over me and Eden and 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.460
 pure my travels because of my foolishness 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.640
 I'm hunched I'm humiliated in great 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.460
 way I'm mourning all day because 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.160
 my loins are full of burning and nothing and 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.010
 healthy in my flesh I am weakened and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.760
 ground very badly but because of the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.400
 shock of my heart sir in front of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.890
 you are all my wishes and my sigh 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.890
 it is not hidden from you my heart is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.440
 distressed has left me my vigor and still 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.239
 the light of my eyes is already missing my 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.489
 friends and my classmates are kept 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.400
 away from my plague and my neighbors have been 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.830
 away those who seek my life arman 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.020
 ties in which they seek my evil speak 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.310
 iniquities and meditate frauds all the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.920
 day more I as if I were deaf I do not hear and 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.350
 I am as a mute who does not open his mouth I am 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.230
 for like a man who does not hear and in whose 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.440
 mouth there is no repression 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.100
 because in you oh jehovah I have waited for you 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.560
 will respond to the jehovah my god said I do not know 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.320
 rejoice over me when my foot slips not 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 they magnify themselves on me but I am 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 point of falling and my pain is in front of 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 me continuously so I will confess my 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.670
 evil and sad me for my sin 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.800
 because my enemies are alive and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 strong that have increased those that I 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.930
 they abhor without cause those who pay badly 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 for good they are against me for following me 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 the good name forsake oh jehovah 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.010
 my god, do not get away from me, hurry up 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.390
 help me 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.390
 oh my lord my salvation
