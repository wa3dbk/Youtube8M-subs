assimilator so you know what this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
assimilator so you know what this
carrier<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.030> able<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
carrier is actually going to be able to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.480 
carrier is actually going to be able to
