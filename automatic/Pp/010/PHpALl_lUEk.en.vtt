00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
easy way to make money in real estate

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
easy way to make money in real estate
and<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:41.059> mindset<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.500> looking

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and is that is that mindset of looking

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
and is that is that mindset of looking
for<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.040> easy<00:00:44.399> way<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> mindset

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
for the easy way is that the mindset

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.880 
for the easy way is that the mindset
that's<00:00:47.879> hurting<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.440> say<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that's hurting you and I say this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.819 
that's hurting you and I say this
because<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.250> find<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.210> students

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
because I find that a lot of students

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
because I find that a lot of students
the<00:00:52.829> most<00:00:53.610> successful<00:00:54.210> students<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> have

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the most successful students that I have

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.189 
the most successful students that I have
the<00:00:55.649> key<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.190> most<00:00:56.969> common<00:00:57.390> element<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the key and most common element that I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.610 
the key and most common element that I
find<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.340> persistence<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
find with them is persistence and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
find with them is persistence and
persistence<00:01:01.620> specifically<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.969> things

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
persistence specifically when things

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
persistence specifically when things
don't<00:01:03.750> work<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.680> hundred<00:01:05.129> percent<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.670> way

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
don't work out a hundred percent the way

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.080 
don't work out a hundred percent the way
they<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> times<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
they want them to and a lot of times I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.710 
they want them to and a lot of times I
always<00:01:09.479> use<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> analogy<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.470> real<00:01:10.650> estate

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
always use the analogy for real estate

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.030 
always use the analogy for real estate
with<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.320> say<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.770> real<00:01:13.920> estate

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
with and I say that real estate

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.800 
with and I say that real estate
especially<00:01:14.369> wholesaling<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> very<00:01:15.420> simple

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
especially wholesaling is a very simple

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.410 
especially wholesaling is a very simple
business<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> simple<00:01:17.520> business<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.330> it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
business it's a simple business but it's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
business it's a simple business but it's
not<00:01:18.479> necessarily<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.110> easy<00:01:19.200> business<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> by

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
not necessarily an easy business and by

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.820 
not necessarily an easy business and by
that<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> mean<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> use<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> analogy<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> car

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that I mean I use the analogy of the car

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.760 
that I mean I use the analogy of the car
if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.580> into<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.210> drive<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> car<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.560> turn

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
if you get into and drive a car you turn

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
if you get into and drive a car you turn
on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> ignition<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.430> put<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.880> Drive<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
on the ignition you put it on Drive and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.580 
on the ignition you put it on Drive and
you<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.080> simple<00:01:28.409> process

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you go it's a very simple process

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
you go it's a very simple process
however<00:01:28.950> underneath<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> hood<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.420> variety

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
however underneath the hood is a variety

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
however underneath the hood is a variety
of<00:01:30.930> different<00:01:31.320> systems<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.860> make<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
of different systems that make all that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
of different systems that make all that
happen<00:01:33.799> in<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.070> simple<00:01:35.430> way<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> don't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
happen in a very simple way so you don't

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.190 
happen in a very simple way so you don't
have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.270> worry<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.650> doing<00:01:37.650> anything

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
have to worry about doing anything

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.389 
have to worry about doing anything
you<00:01:39.350> know<00:01:39.439> we<00:01:39.740> have<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.979> worry<00:01:40.100> about<00:01:40.159> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
you know we have to worry about the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.190 
you know we have to worry about the
electrical<00:01:40.850> component<00:01:41.270> at<00:01:41.329> your<00:01:41.479> corners<00:01:42.079> or

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
electrical component at your corners or

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.139 
electrical component at your corners or
anything<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.649> it<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.100> real<00:01:43.789> estate<00:01:43.909> is

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
anything like that it so real estate is

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.270 
anything like that it so real estate is
somewhat<00:01:44.719> like<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.289> it's<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.130> very

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
somewhat like that in that it's a very

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.730 
somewhat like that in that it's a very
simple<00:01:46.520> process<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.360> find<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.719> deal<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:48.500> find

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
simple process you find a deal you find

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.080 
simple process you find a deal you find
an<00:01:48.890> investor<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.429> put<00:01:49.579> them<00:01:49.670> together<00:01:49.759> you

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
an investor you put them together you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.209 
an investor you put them together you
make<00:01:50.240> some<00:01:50.420> money<00:01:50.590> however<00:01:51.590> there's<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.009> lot<00:01:52.130> of

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
make some money however there's a lot of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.819 
make some money however there's a lot of
things<00:01:52.460> underneath<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:54.710> know

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
things underneath that you know
