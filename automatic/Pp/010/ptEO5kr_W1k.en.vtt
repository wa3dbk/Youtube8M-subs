00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 if you have dear friends with you i am 11 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.610
 Vasiliev and this is the site of playing guitar. 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.400
 met Putin before us straight 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
 which takshaki yen will be vidosiki by 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 playing guitar 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.550
 reference to him Carlos is supposed to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.539
 description under this video so 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 subscribe to my channel and watch 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.400
 his video tutorials in this video tutorial 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.170
 dear friends i will show you a couple 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 warm-up exercises that will help 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.090
 you develop the stretching of the fingers of your left hand 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.219
 and work out a little consistency 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
 arm movement well, and let's actually 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.600
 Immediately proceed to the analysis of data 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 exercise pass first birth 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 which I will show you this so-called 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.829
 ladder think many of you have already heard 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.680
 about such an exercise but still you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.920
 Now I will show the essence of this exercise. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.800
 is that you will need 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.020
 alternately lose each amount by 4 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.719
 frets with all four fingers 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 that is, by this principle we begin 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 play from the sixth string with 1 set 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.589
 here the first fingers and the project to him so 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.020
 that's the way 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:11.850
 then put the second finger on 2 you now 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.250
 we put on 3 and 4 guys we put on 4 when 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.500
 playing fingers do not remove that is not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 it is necessary at such development speaks will pull 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.850
 losing and leaving all fingers on 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 Ladar then we go down on the fifth string and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.500
 we warm up in the same way that is the first 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.049
 lan 2 3 4 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.680
 Then we go down to the sum of four 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.680
 the same 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 then a third amount 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.850
 This is how we get to the first 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.270
 strings 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.360
 gave little finger move from 4 frets to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.250
 fifth way and doing all the same 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.570
 only in the opposite direction 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.380
 there are 5 4 3 2 I rise to the second amount 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.530
 losing 5 4 3 2 rise to the third 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 string 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.240
 reaching 6 strings and moving forward 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.370
 just one way that is from 2 to 3 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:24.910
 they are the same on the game before the first 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:27.010
 string and in this way 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.500
 losing house 12 fret 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.040
 then you can return in reverse 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.440
 direction 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.090
 either started with 1 okay as for 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.520
 your right-handed then here i am you 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.890
 recommend rules for awarding 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.850
 mediator help and develop technique 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.740
 alternating stroke 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.570
 that is, play kick down up down 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.190
 up like this 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.190
 yourself start with a punch down 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.610
 in this way we will need 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.260
 exercise this exercise and so a 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.890
 now let's deal with the second 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.900
 exercise 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.370
 the second exercise is the so-called 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.810
 chromatic scale 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.970
 this exercise will be a little bit 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.700
 more difficult but still it will be the same 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.370
 useful for developing stretch by digit 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.970
 in hand and working out coherence 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.520
 movements 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.330
 both of this exercise will begin 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.640
 play from 6 strings im here 5 frets and 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.680
 we start to lose in the same way as 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.020
 ladder that is, put 1 fingers and 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.570
 alternately lose 4 frets by all 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.890
 four fingers that is losing 5 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.880
 okay 6 7 8 now we go down to the side 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.850
 lower but now we take the first Paz 4 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.720
 presses that is how we move 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.720
 a little back losing 4 5 paws 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.690
 we drop to the fourth string and again 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:04.850
 move back that is pressing 3 fret 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:09.260
 4 5 6 5 string again moving back and 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:13.700
 play 2 3 4 5 on the second string 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.260
 let's go through the same thing that is 2 3 4 5 on 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.359
 we play the first string since 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.490
 the first fret that is 1 2 3 4 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:31.409
 and come back the second amount 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:33.219
 play 5 lag rub the same 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:42.520
 on the fourth string 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:43.180
 from 6 shaft fret on 5 sonnet 7 frets and 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.250
 sixth string 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.360
 from 8 to like this 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.849
 is playing 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:05:12.849
 let me show you this exercise 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:05:14.740
 how it will look all together here 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.169
 this way you lose this 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.060
 exercise to know your right handed 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.919
 then lose this exercise when 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.900
 help tricks of change that theirs that is 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.719
 blows down up down up and when 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.279
 mediator aid 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.400
 given it will be more important 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.400
 that's the way 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.360
 in this way you manifest data 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.630
 exercise these two simple exercises 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.460
 you will need to manifest as 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.470
 warming up that is as soon as they took 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.720
 loud guitar first thing we lose 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.820
 exactly these two exercises if daily 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.000
 play this guitar exercise 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.860
 at least 5-10 minutes after 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.900
 for a while you will notice the difference then 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.140
 have improved stretching fingers left 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.510
 arms and improve running around the neck 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.660
 detail so dear friends not 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.490
 neglect these exercises and 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.100
 work them out every day on the same 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.919
