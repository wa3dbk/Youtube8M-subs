front<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> back

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.929 

got<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.040> good<00:01:28.250> idea<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:30.470> Benham<00:01:30.939> doesn't

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
got a good idea here this Benham doesn't

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.080 
got a good idea here this Benham doesn't
have<00:01:32.090> as<00:01:32.270> good<00:01:32.380> articulation<00:01:33.380> as<00:01:34.090> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
have as good articulation as the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.399 
have as good articulation as the
spider-man<00:01:35.540> got<00:01:36.140> at<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.440> knee<00:01:38.200> they<00:01:39.200> also

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
have these holes in the feet here so you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.289

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
can use them for Lego pegs and that will

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.760 
can use them for Lego pegs and that will
