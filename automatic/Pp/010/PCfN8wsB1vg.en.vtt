I've taken away from the whole project
is<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.830> it's<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.580> important<00:01:51.150> for<00:01:51.180> Keith

can be more than just science that there
is<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.380> many<00:02:34.500> things<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:34.950> mix<00:02:35.220> your

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
is so many things that you can mix your

is so many things that you can mix your

labeling a lesson of science you get an

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.860 
labeling a lesson of science you get an

building before other social skills so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.970 
building before other social skills so
much<00:02:47.430> more<00:02:47.640> than<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.260> because<00:02:49.260> before<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
much more than just because before and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.789 
much more than just because before and
it's<00:02:50.400> always<00:02:50.549> been<00:02:50.880> sent<00:02:51.720> result<00:02:52.410> has<00:02:52.620> also

book<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> pitch<00:03:14.609> I

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
book on a pitch I

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.560 
book on a pitch I
says<00:03:15.110> something<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.620> spark<00:03:15.890> another<00:03:16.670> idea<00:03:17.300> you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
says something to spark another idea you

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.090 
says something to spark another idea you
just<00:03:17.750> have<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> go<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.800> listen<00:03:19.070> to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
just have to go with that and listen to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.740 
just have to go with that and listen to
what<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> children<00:03:19.580> are<00:03:19.790> saying<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.480> this

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
what the children are saying to this

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.170 
what the children are saying to this
project<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.560> as<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.250> teacher<00:03:22.490> I<00:03:22.640> would<00:03:22.850> be<00:03:23.000> more

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
project and as a teacher I would be more

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.090 
project and as a teacher I would be more
likely<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.480> take<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.960> children<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.500> w5

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
likely to take the children to w5

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.130 
likely to take the children to w5
because<00:03:25.490> we<00:03:26.210> don't<00:03:26.390> there's<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.780> much<00:03:26.930> that

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
because we don't there's so much that

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.420 
because we don't there's so much that
they<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.470> children<00:03:27.770> they<00:03:27.860> learn<00:03:28.070> from<00:03:28.250> their

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
they the children they learn from their

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.550 
they the children they learn from their
experience<00:03:29.000> w<00:03:29.270> 5<00:03:29.450> from<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.750> exhibits<00:03:30.320> and

from the work shape of the workshop it

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.560 
from the work shape of the workshop it
wasn't<00:03:33.710> just<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> exhibits<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:35.240> do<00:03:35.360> with

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
forces that we were teaching they

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.830

geography the weather and things like
that<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.830> learned<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.190> much<00:03:43.310> more<00:03:43.580> than<00:03:43.760> just

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
that it learned so much more than just

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.270 
that it learned so much more than just
science<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.140> even<00:03:45.380> aside<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:45.650> actual<00:03:46.130> topic

areas and the science and what it was
that<00:03:48.410> was<00:03:48.710> great<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.070> see<00:03:49.100> there<00:03:49.340> were<00:03:49.400> no

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
that was great to see there were no

nice<00:03:58.040> which<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.370> moving<00:03:58.670> more<00:03:58.970> difficult<00:03:59.360> to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
nice which is moving more difficult to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.870
