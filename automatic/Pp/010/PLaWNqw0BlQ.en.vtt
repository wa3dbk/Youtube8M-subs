president<00:05:29.320> are<00:05:29.470> we<00:05:29.770> making<00:05:30.190> good<00:05:30.400> judgments

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
about how to keep America safe precisely

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.980 
about how to keep America safe precisely
because<00:05:35.460> sending<00:05:36.460> our<00:05:36.850> military<00:05:37.390> into<00:05:37.660> battle

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
because sending our military into battle

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.240 
because sending our military into battle
is<00:05:38.800> such<00:05:39.580> an<00:05:39.940> enormous<00:05:40.270> step<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.950> point

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
is such an enormous step and the point

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.030 
is such an enormous step and the point
that<00:05:42.700> I<00:05:42.910> originally<00:05:43.330> made<00:05:43.780> is<00:05:44.080> that<00:05:44.380> we<00:05:44.800> took

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
that I originally made is that we took

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.630 
that I originally made is that we took
our<00:05:45.280> eye<00:05:45.310> off<00:05:46.620> Afghanistan<00:05:47.620> we<00:05:47.980> took<00:05:48.220> our<00:05:48.430> eye

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
our eye off Afghanistan we took our eye

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.900 
our eye off Afghanistan we took our eye
off<00:05:48.669> the<00:05:49.570> folks<00:05:49.840> who<00:05:50.410> perpetrated<00:05:50.950> 911<00:05:51.520> they

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
off the folks who perpetrated 911 they

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.140 
off the folks who perpetrated 911 they
are<00:05:52.060> still<00:05:52.360> sending<00:05:52.660> out<00:05:52.900> video<00:05:53.230> tapes<00:05:53.530> and

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
these places and I know what our

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.769 
these places and I know what our
security<00:06:56.159> requirements<00:06:56.879> are<00:06:57.090> and<00:06:57.360> I<00:06:57.750> know

00:06:57.769 --> 00:06:57.779

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:03.719 
that we will prevail in Afghanistan but

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:05.659 
that we will prevail in Afghanistan but
we<00:07:03.870> need<00:07:04.110> the<00:07:04.289> new<00:07:04.439> strategy<00:07:05.009> and<00:07:05.279> we<00:07:05.460> needed

we need the new strategy and we needed
to<00:07:05.879> succeed<00:07:06.330> but<00:07:06.569> the<00:07:06.689> important<00:07:07.169> thing<00:07:07.229> is<00:07:07.379> if

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
to succeed but the important thing is if

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:10.489
