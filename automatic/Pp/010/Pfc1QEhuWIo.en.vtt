now<00:01:17.869> on<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.049> telephone<00:01:18.350> call<00:01:18.590> basically<00:01:19.009> it

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
now on a telephone call basically it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.100 
now on a telephone call basically it
knocks<00:01:19.369> out<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.549> high<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.149> low<00:01:20.479> frequencies

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
knocks out the high and low frequencies

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.460 
knocks out the high and low frequencies
so<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:22.580> just<00:01:22.700> knock<00:01:22.940> all<00:01:23.210> these<00:01:23.540> down<00:01:23.930> here

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
so if you just knock all these down here

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.170 
so if you just knock all these down here
you'll<00:01:25.039> hear<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.460> gradual<00:01:25.729> change<00:01:25.970> if<00:01:26.090> you've

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
you'll hear the gradual change if you've

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.969 
you'll hear the gradual change if you've
got<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.299> monitor<00:01:26.539> on<00:01:26.630> in<00:01:26.990> your<00:01:27.350> headphones<00:01:27.740> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
got a monitor on in your headphones and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.609 
got a monitor on in your headphones and
how<00:01:28.280> you're<00:01:28.549> sounding<00:01:29.030> I've<00:01:29.810> normally<00:01:30.170> done<00:01:30.289> a

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
how you're sounding I've normally done a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.340 
how you're sounding I've normally done a
few<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.280> these<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.789> I've<00:01:32.479> even<00:01:32.720> saved<00:01:33.110> as<00:01:33.320> a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
few of these and I've even saved as a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.870 
few of these and I've even saved as a
preset<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:34.009> don't<00:01:34.220> have<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.369> do<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:34.550> every

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
preset so I don't have to do this every

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.760 
preset so I don't have to do this every
single<00:01:35.030> time<00:01:35.330> which<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.990> really<00:01:36.350> really<00:01:36.590> good

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
single time which is really really good

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.130 
single time which is really really good
so<00:01:37.550> it's<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:37.789> just<00:01:38.330> drop<00:01:38.509> most<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:39.020> these

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
so it's just just drop most of these

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.680 
so it's just just drop most of these
down<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.850> as<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.909> can<00:01:41.149> hear<00:01:41.210> in<00:01:41.539> my<00:01:41.569> voice

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
down and as you can hear in my voice

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.540 
down and as you can hear in my voice
it's<00:01:42.289> gradually<00:01:42.950> sounding<00:01:43.280> more<00:01:43.369> like<00:01:43.429> a

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
it's gradually sounding more like a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.889 
it's gradually sounding more like a
phone<00:01:43.759> call<00:01:43.970> there<00:01:44.450> are<00:01:44.539> loads<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.840> different

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
phone call there are loads of different

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.070 
phone call there are loads of different
ways<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.920> can<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.670> how<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.960> might

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
ways you can do this and how you might

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.809 
ways you can do this and how you might

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
to learn sound so just experiment and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.889 
to learn sound so just experiment and
play<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.850> graphic<00:01:53.119> equalizer<00:01:53.509> until

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
play with the graphic equalizer until

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.340 
play with the graphic equalizer until
you<00:01:54.020> get<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> sound<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.920> suits<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.520> okay

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350

you get a sound that suits you okay
there<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.470> go<00:01:57.500> that's<00:01:58.009> just<00:01:58.280> up<00:01:58.520> maybe<00:01:59.000> some<00:01:59.119> of

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
there we go that's just up maybe some of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.789 
there we go that's just up maybe some of
the<00:01:59.390> middle<00:01:59.690> ones<00:01:59.869> because<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.679> middle

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the middle ones because the middle

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.490 
the middle ones because the middle
frequencies<00:02:01.369> are<00:02:01.490> increased<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:02.200> lower<00:02:03.200> some

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
frequencies are increased and lower some

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.779 
frequencies are increased and lower some
of<00:02:03.590> these<00:02:03.709> you<00:02:04.069> know<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.429> can<00:02:04.610> look<00:02:04.729> like

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
of these you know it can look like

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.580 
of these you know it can look like
anything<00:02:05.239> to<00:02:05.509> be<00:02:05.599> honest<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.319> there<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:06.560> go
