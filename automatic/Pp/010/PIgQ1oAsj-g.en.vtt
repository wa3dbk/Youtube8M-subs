in the effects panel you have your post

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.480 
in the effects panel you have your post
crop<00:00:12.480> vignette<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.860> your<00:00:14.009> grain<00:00:14.280> so

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
crop vignette and you have your grain so

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.910 
crop vignette and you have your grain so
let's<00:00:14.670> look<00:00:14.790> at<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.299> by<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:16.770> your

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
let's look at that one by one now your

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.029 
let's look at that one by one now your
post<00:00:17.160> cropping<00:00:17.670> yet<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:19.010> basically<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
post cropping yet is basically a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859 
post cropping yet is basically a
vignette<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.820> add<00:00:21.000> after<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.600> crop

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
vignette that you add after you crop

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.210 
vignette that you add after you crop
your<00:00:22.020> image<00:00:23.720> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> ensure<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
your image this is to ensure that the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.550 
your image this is to ensure that the
vignette<00:00:26.670> affects<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> corners<00:00:28.320> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
vignette affects all of the corners of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.169 
vignette affects all of the corners of
the<00:00:28.859> image<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> sides<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> image

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the image all the sides of the image

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.939 
the image all the sides of the image
because<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> crop<00:00:31.080> an<00:00:31.230> image<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
because when you crop an image and you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.180 
because when you crop an image and you
don't<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> post<00:00:32.790> crop<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> yet<00:00:33.390> image<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.190> post

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
don't do a post crop in yet image a post

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
don't do a post crop in yet image a post
crop<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.550> yet<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:36.809> add<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
crop in yet then it will add the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.369 
crop in yet then it will add the
vignette<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> whole<00:00:39.540> image<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
vignette to the the whole image as it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
vignette to the the whole image as it
was<00:00:40.530> before<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.040> cropped<00:00:41.340> therefore<00:00:42.090> some

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
was before you cropped therefore some

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.880 
was before you cropped therefore some
sides<00:00:43.469> might<00:00:44.040> not<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.500> vignette<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
sides might not have a vignette on it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.600 
sides might not have a vignette on it
and<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.160> fact<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> crop<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> image

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
and in fact if you crop in to the image

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
and in fact if you crop in to the image
cutting<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.120> sides<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.140> might

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
cutting out all the sides then you might

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.450 
cutting out all the sides then you might
not<00:00:52.440> even<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> yet<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
not even have it yet because the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
not even have it yet because the
vignette<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.239> been<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> crop

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
vignette would have been in the crop

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
vignette would have been in the crop
area<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> post<00:00:56.670> cropping

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
area so you want to do the post cropping

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.750 
area so you want to do the post cropping
yet<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.350> sides

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
yet if you want them on all the sides

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
yet if you want them on all the sides
you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.879> also<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.270> highlight<00:01:01.140> priority<00:01:01.710> color

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you can also do highlight priority color

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479 
you can also do highlight priority color
priority<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> paint<00:01:04.320> priority<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.070> always

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
priority and paint priority but i always

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.170 
priority and paint priority but i always
do<00:01:05.970> highlight<00:01:06.540> priority<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
do highlight priority so here you have

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.969 
do highlight priority so here you have
your<00:01:09.299> amount<00:01:12.170> your<00:01:13.170> midpoint<00:01:15.470> your<00:01:16.470> roundness

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
your amount your midpoint your roundness

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
your amount your midpoint your roundness
your<00:01:17.430> feather<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.180> highlights<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
your feather and your highlights and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
your feather and your highlights and
let's<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
let's go through this one by one so the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570 
let's go through this one by one so the
hot<00:01:21.960> amount<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:23.250> self-explanatory

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hot amount is pretty self-explanatory

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.230 
hot amount is pretty self-explanatory
you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> darker<00:01:25.100> which<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.340> make

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you can make it darker which will make

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.109 
you can make it darker which will make
the<00:01:27.540> vignette<00:01:27.960> darker<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.759> make<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the vignette darker or you can make a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
the vignette darker or you can make a
lighter<00:01:30.390> which<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:30.780> make<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> white<00:01:31.290> vignette

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
lighter which will make a white vignette

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.670 
lighter which will make a white vignette
so<00:01:32.299> usually<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.420> downwards<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so usually go downwards you have the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
so usually go downwards you have the
vignette<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.790> midpoint<00:01:36.350> stretches

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
vignette there the midpoint stretches

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
vignette there the midpoint stretches
the<00:01:37.470> vignette<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.600> increasing<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the vignette out here I'm increasing the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
the vignette out here I'm increasing the
midpoint<00:01:40.229> therefore<00:01:40.650> pushing<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> vignette

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
midpoint therefore pushing the vignette

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
midpoint therefore pushing the vignette
out<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> pull<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
out but if I pull it in you can see that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.319 
out but if I pull it in you can see that
it's<00:01:44.490> bringing<00:01:45.060> leaving<00:01:45.659> yet<00:01:45.810> into<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> image

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
it's bringing leaving yet into the image

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.039 
it's bringing leaving yet into the image
so<00:01:48.329> we'll<00:01:48.450> keep<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.720> around<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.220> roundness

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
so we'll keep that around here roundness

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.539 
so we'll keep that around here roundness
sort<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.170> makes<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.590> more<00:01:52.740> free-flowing<00:01:53.070> if

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
sort of makes it more free-flowing if

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
sort of makes it more free-flowing if
you<00:01:53.670> increase<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.990> decrease

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you increase it and then if you decrease

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.249 
you increase it and then if you decrease
it<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.899> know<00:01:57.930> more

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
it it's going to make it you know more

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.760 
it it's going to make it you know more
more<00:02:01.259> straight<00:02:01.619> basically<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.850> if

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
more straight basically if you if you if

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.139 
more straight basically if you if you if
you<00:02:04.770> decrease<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.460> makes<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> less<00:02:05.909> round

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you decrease it it makes a less round

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.080 
you decrease it it makes a less round
and<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.479> feather<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.910> softens<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> edges

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and then feather just softens the edges

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.360 
and then feather just softens the edges
and<00:02:09.420> makes<00:02:09.750> them<00:02:09.959> more<00:02:10.289> obvious<00:02:10.739> or<00:02:10.890> hardens

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and makes them more obvious or hardens

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220 
and makes them more obvious or hardens
the<00:02:11.459> edges<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the edges like this so you want that to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.809 
the edges like this so you want that to
be<00:02:13.379> soft

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
be soft

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.179 
be soft
well<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.780> typically<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.530> know<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.829> way<00:02:16.159> I

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
well that's typically you know the way I

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.179 
well that's typically you know the way I
make<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.609> vignette<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:18.019> either<00:02:18.530> stretch<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
make the vignette I either stretch the

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.830 
make the vignette I either stretch the
midpoint<00:02:19.609> out<00:02:19.730> or<00:02:19.909> bring<00:02:20.389> it<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.689> center

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
midpoint out or bring it to the center

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.199 
midpoint out or bring it to the center
depending<00:02:21.469> on<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.680> image<00:02:21.920> but<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.639> amount

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
depending on the image but the amount

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.750 
depending on the image but the amount
always<00:02:23.689> goes<00:02:23.900> lower<00:02:24.170> around<00:02:25.129> us<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.459> always

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
always goes lower around us I always

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.459 
always goes lower around us I always
increase<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.299> then<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.719> feather<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.049> always

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
increase and then the feather I always

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.860 
increase and then the feather I always
increase<00:02:28.389> then<00:02:29.389> there's<00:02:29.569> also<00:02:29.749> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
increase then there's also the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.899 
increase then there's also the
highlights<00:02:30.409> which<00:02:30.650> compensates<00:02:31.069> for<00:02:31.430> you

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
highlights which compensates for you

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.429 
highlights which compensates for you
know<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.180> highlights<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.719> your<00:02:32.870> image<00:02:33.019> but

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
know the highlights in your image but

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.800 
know the highlights in your image but
you<00:02:33.620> typically<00:02:34.129> don't<00:02:34.459> need<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.239> touch<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
you typically don't need to touch the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.270 
you typically don't need to touch the
highlights<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.469> just<00:02:36.650> need<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.859> touch<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
highlights you just need to touch the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280 
highlights you just need to touch the
amount<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:38.239> midpoint<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:38.810> roundness<00:02:39.079> in<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
amount the midpoint the roundness in the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.390 
amount the midpoint the roundness in the
feather<00:02:39.909> then<00:02:40.909> there's<00:02:41.150> grain<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.189> film<00:02:43.189> has

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
feather then there's grain so film has

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.099 
feather then there's grain so film has
been<00:02:43.609> coming<00:02:43.879> back<00:02:44.120> these<00:02:44.329> days<00:02:44.540> or<00:02:44.810> at<00:02:44.870> least

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
been coming back these days or at least

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.740 
been coming back these days or at least
the<00:02:45.349> film<00:02:45.709> look<00:02:46.219> and<00:02:46.459> one<00:02:46.790> part<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.599> film

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
the film look and one part of the film

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.629 
the film look and one part of the film
look<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.079> people<00:02:48.439> like<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.859> the<00:02:49.010> grain<00:02:49.280> so

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
look that people like is the grain so

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.569 
look that people like is the grain so
let's<00:02:50.299> add<00:02:50.450> some<00:02:50.480> green<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.469> this<00:02:51.680> image<00:02:51.859> so

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
let's add some green to this image so

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.530 
let's add some green to this image so
I've<00:02:52.879> zoomed<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:54.819> usually<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.849> put<00:02:56.269> around

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
I've zoomed in and usually I put around

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.559 
I've zoomed in and usually I put around
25<00:02:57.079> grain<00:02:57.469> and<00:02:57.799> that<00:02:58.400> usually<00:02:58.579> does<00:02:58.969> the<00:02:59.419> job

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
25 grain and that usually does the job

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.899 
25 grain and that usually does the job
just<00:02:59.840> fine<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.409> can<00:03:00.530> see<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.769> adds<00:03:00.919> texture<00:03:01.639> to

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
just fine you can see it adds texture to

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.179 
just fine you can see it adds texture to
the<00:03:02.030> face<00:03:02.269> add<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:03.199> more<00:03:03.439> dimension<00:03:03.919> to<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
the face add just more dimension to the

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.039 
the face add just more dimension to the
image<00:03:04.519> sometimes<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.449> increase<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.900> to

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
image sometimes you can increase it to

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.069 
image sometimes you can increase it to
30<00:03:06.430> that's<00:03:07.430> pushing<00:03:07.849> it<00:03:07.909> sometimes<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.569> the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
30 that's pushing it sometimes and the

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.689 
30 that's pushing it sometimes and the
size<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.560> roundness<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:10.129> just<00:03:10.280> keep<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.579> the

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:10.699 
size and roundness I just keep that the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.050 
size and roundness I just keep that the
same<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:12.019> size<00:03:12.230> obviously<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.579> size<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.969> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
same the size obviously the size of the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.819 
same the size obviously the size of the
grains<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.599> increase<00:03:15.109> it<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.500> Koreans<00:03:15.769> will

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
grains you increase it the Koreans will

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.839 
grains you increase it the Koreans will
be<00:03:15.980> bigger<00:03:16.189> and<00:03:16.510> then<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.629> roundness<00:03:18.849> changes

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
be bigger and then the roundness changes

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.780 
be bigger and then the roundness changes
the<00:03:20.060> way<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.959> grain<00:03:21.290> looks<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> usually

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the way the grain looks but I usually

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.449 
the way the grain looks but I usually
keep<00:03:22.909> that<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.269> 25<00:03:23.419> and<00:03:24.049> 50<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.799> then<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.430> only

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
keep that to 25 and 50 and then the only

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.729 
keep that to 25 and 50 and then the only
thing<00:03:25.669> that<00:03:25.939> I<00:03:25.970> changes<00:03:26.419> the<00:03:26.569> amount<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:27.079> can

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
thing that I changes the amount that can

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.499 
thing that I changes the amount that can
these<00:03:28.069> two<00:03:28.099> things<00:03:28.519> can<00:03:28.699> really<00:03:28.759> dramatically

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:29.509 
these two things can really dramatically

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.110 
these two things can really dramatically
change<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:31.009> way<00:03:31.129> your<00:03:31.310> image<00:03:31.549> looks<00:03:31.909> for

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
change the the way your image looks for

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.119 
change the the way your image looks for
example<00:03:32.449> if<00:03:32.509> I<00:03:32.569> remove<00:03:32.840> them<00:03:33.019> in<00:03:33.109> yet<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.530> I

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
example if I remove them in yet and I

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.030 
example if I remove them in yet and I
remove<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.209> green<00:03:35.419> looks<00:03:36.229> a<00:03:36.319> lot<00:03:36.439> different<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
remove the green looks a lot different I

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.280 
remove the green looks a lot different I
add<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.489> vignette<00:03:37.819> gets<00:03:38.569> dark<00:03:38.870> around<00:03:39.019> the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
add the vignette gets dark around the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.280 
add the vignette gets dark around the
images<00:03:39.709> more<00:03:40.340> focus<00:03:40.879> at<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.509> grain<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.049> adds

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
images more focus at the grain it adds

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.349 
images more focus at the grain it adds
more<00:03:42.500> grit<00:03:42.859> more<00:03:43.220> texture<00:03:43.699> and<00:03:43.939> makes<00:03:44.120> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
more grit more texture and makes the

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.149 
more grit more texture and makes the
image<00:03:44.509> feel<00:03:44.900> more<00:03:45.199> alive<00:03:45.409> so<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.739> can<00:03:45.889> really

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
image feel more alive so you can really

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.879 
image feel more alive so you can really
use<00:03:46.489> these<00:03:46.729> to<00:03:46.939> your<00:03:47.060> advantage<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.859> create<00:03:48.859> a

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
use these to your advantage to create a
