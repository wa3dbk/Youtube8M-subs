 more than ever know how to value the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.829

 among others and she gives a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 valued in the cast itself 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 It's very beautiful, how are we? 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 our language starts and the idea today is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:58.469
 make a gift to his father to mother 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 boy selling a picture he can afford 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.980
 It may even be a comic depends on 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.080
 As you want to use it then here 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.479
 on paper the texture I'm using 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.549
 back side of paper 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.610
 You're welcome. Nothing prevents you from making a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.470
 normal side and just to stay different and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 I will pass pv-ac paint in blue color 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 deep pass on to the cimpor that this 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 here the staff already makes you with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 soft brush in circles that brush your 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.060
 over there 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.759
 so he did not enter into the truth 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.229
 he goes to the sun it here emphasized in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.229
 however below 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:38.640
 so we always do this in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 deep throw circles 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 gunner the whole paper as well. 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.250
 after you had to notice that 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.229
 He was annoying, he can paint again. 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.750
 Marisa works with the movements 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.159
 circulate until the ink penetrates 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.159
 Whats the destination 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.540
 Remember that it has to be little thought but 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.260
 if the hard brush will leave marked up 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.600
 so I had a soft brush and let it 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.840
 I 've already brought a towel here in the form 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.900
 of renan base before lightening a little 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.830
 More over there only the design will catch a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.830
 little black powder paint just a little bit 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:45.850
 a little bit and company very well 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:16.400
 It's easy, it 's always clearer too. 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:26.320

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:49.299
