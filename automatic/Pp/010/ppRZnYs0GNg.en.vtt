00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.860
 Hello today, February 9, I rented 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.750
 tobacco seed germination report 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.820
 I spread each variety 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.770
 separately signed on paper to 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.460
 it was clearly visible so do not know too 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.119
 I can't get close to the camera 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.640
 not clear 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.719
 approximately from this distance so here 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:41.690
 here we see virginia gold 2013 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:44.589
 here she is in this here too she that 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.409
 we see similarities almost 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:51.879
 one hundred percent quickly ascended see already 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:55.159
 he plants already he is all green 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.749
 literally 4 linden trees on the third day 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:03.010
 appeared amicable shoots now 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:06.549
 a week has passed and here they are 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.630
 large green roots were already allowed 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.450
 very very good germination 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.030
 literally somewhere around 95 percent 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.539
 there are literally a few few seeds 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.920
 which did not hatch 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.969
 iran got stuck 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.170
 and amicably am very pleased with this variety 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:32.060
 virginia gold 2013 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:35.359
 the tobacco was this medium so strong 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 a bit strong was but you can smoke it 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.770
 compared to virginia which i got 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.700
 in the fourteenth year it is acceptable 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.549
 tobacco in the fourteenth year was very 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.340
 very strong spinning so I even 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:54.020
 I think maybe it will not plant either 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 I will plant quite a bit because of her 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.929
 very few people can smoke very strong 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.509
 virginia 2013 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:05.149
 strong but tolerant and much she 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.039
 I liked just such a fortress those who 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.190
 likes cigarettes tighter and and smoked with 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:14.900
 pleasure 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.090
 here it is virginia gold 2013 will 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 fuzzy but you can still see clearly 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:32.760
 she he already but he already grows as could and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 Here, too, the same variety here too it is by 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.080
 jimmy year I kept it for two years 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.080
 in boxes I shook them out and did not answer 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.330
 nothing here here they can be serve 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.700
 percent on 5 today and this is a proven 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.220
 here the similarity is better 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.730
 so now the overthrow of gold is 14 years old 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.900
 literally 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 but here we hardly see under 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.440
 I found a magnifying glass 5 seeds 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.140
 which started to hurt a lot 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.220
 slowly and very well together maybe I 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.280
 I'll plant it a little bit to get 7 seeds 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.830
 more and so basically i like 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.400
 a little disappointed in this sort 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.220
 and the seeds ripen badly and the similarity is not 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.860
 friendly and long and and tobacco unnecessary 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.860
 strong on him how to say little 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:39.170
 consumers of such strong tobacco so 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.290
 here we have number 3 gabbana gold 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.350
 bent 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.440
 he has a similarity today 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:51.330
 the day is literally somewhere five percent 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.620
 too long a little hatch here 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.450
 you can see white literally percent 5 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.760
 the rest have slept while still sleeping but 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.070
 she planted it when she, too, in my 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.480
 as far as I remember 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:09.870
 went very not together and so long 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.709
 number 4 galitsky original but with 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.280
 he has 20 percent better than him 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.380
 knocked 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.430
 and here they were too early enough 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.050
 hatch and don't think so what can 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.200
 still there someone will not be based on 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.419
 similarities 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.630
 You can roughly calculate how many seeds 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.290
 what smaller varieties are needed 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.910
 what sort is bigger to get 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.190
 right amount of plants so anniversary 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.080
 new 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.919
 literally it looked two plants 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.110
 only 22 seeds found which 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.840
 hiked 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.020
 but let's see he is a relative movie 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.540
 rejection may just come up a long time 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.660
 maybe did not have time to mature 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.310
 if I behave badly I give up 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.640
 him in favor of some other 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.979
 varieties so talgar 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.890
 Talgar I do not really like itself 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:17.050
 the plant itself was low yielding 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:20.380
 but he has a good similarity literally 30 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.400
 percent already slapped and still there 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.550
 I hate so I see that for this 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.950
 a variety I can say he does not yield 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.030
 very high well at least this 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.370
 plants that were sent to me but 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.560
 very, very early and very 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.240
 unpretentious you bile very easy 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.400
 and now I think so if I have anyone here 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.260
 in the village I asked them the seeds 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.200
 suggested that these particular seeds because 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.890
 what do people like to say they have experience 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.150
 small 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:58.360
 and they have with this variety even without 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.270
 experiences i think they will turn out so this 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 here is lyubek so back in quotes why in 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.060
 quotes because i took these seeds with 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.860
 Lubeck's beds apparently this is some kind of 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.960
 Lubeck and what I do not know Well, maybe 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.229
 I can put maybe not so could the similarity 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.700
 This tube is 10 percent today 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.730
 moment 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:25.220
 but I have already spoken about this variety 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:28.380
 virginia gold 13 years old from boxes 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.110
 her similarity is great just by 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.320
 compared to others just like that 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.550
 immediately it will be seen here is greens and 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.870
 there is greenery here and here so here and there 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.990
 little by little 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:47.760
 so again in a quick virginia goal 13 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:50.820
 years wonderful virginia 14 years so far 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.890
 only a few shoots of havana gold 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.660
 also there is literally a percentage of the total 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.000
 Galician original percent 20 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.680
 knocked 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.690
 the anniversary of a new pair of badly it a couple 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.230
 sunflower seeds only 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:13.050
 Talgar percent 30 slid 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:17.900
 lubeck percent 10 virginia so what else 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.580
 wanted to say I was asked for seeds 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.760
 buy people who want to plant 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.570
 a few hundred square meters 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.880
 This statement is exactly how to say 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.850
 wholesale a large number I have a lot 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:38.040
 seeds most seeds about those if 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:42.630
 for example someone wants to plant a lot there 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.880
 5 10 acres contact, I think you can 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.880
 to plant 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.080
 try this particular variety so thanks 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.380
 for your attention 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.080
 still think so in a week maybe 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.440
 I will try to remove even finally 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:02.370
 for this variety which is bad 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.000
 peeking in the meantime thanks for 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.920
 Attention 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.760
 about a week again with you 

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.760
 will meet
