00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.290
 daytime fires the soft airs it is a natural way to increase 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.329
 visibility of your car and improve the safety of 

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.839
 drivers like pedestrians 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.449
 from february 2011 the face of systems dr she will be rendered 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 mandatory on new models by a European directive 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.730
 pioneer systems the ddll for cars philippe 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.900
 now offers approved lighting solutions in compliance with standards 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.399
 European and adapted to most European models 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.470
 these lights are installed only an hour and a half on average 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.860
 we took for this demonstration a European model 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 popular with the audi a3 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.310
 the lamp type contains a user manual and two modules drl 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.360
 etc. 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.900
 two fixing brackets 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.170
 an electronic control box the gameplay and a pressure connector 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 as well as mounting accessories 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.870
 you have to first decide you want you to place the lamps 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.260
 start measuring the car to verify that the mounting position 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.630
 obey the European regulations 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.700
 you will find a diagram containing these details in the manual 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
 instruction on daytime lights point fr 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 for some cars it may be necessary to remove the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.570
 lower grille 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.070
 to mount the stirrups 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.030
 to do this 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.840
 you may need to loosen a body panel 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.270
 remove the grille mark the position of the caliper and use a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.960
 drill and a jigsaw to drill a hole so that they can 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.400
 be well secured 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.070
 then put the grille back on the car while finding the angle 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.610
 optimal for sorting them which must be at 10 degrees maximum from the direction 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.330
 facing the car 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.420
 indeed again the calender so that the prices are fixed appropriately 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 for some cars like the Alfa Romeo 159 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.380
 just fix the moors directly on the panel of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.229
 body 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.979
 once you are assured that the English investigated at 10 degrees 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.799
 maximum of the direction facing the car 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.379
 mark the holes on the stirrup 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.379
 and loses its software so that they are in place 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.699
 to connect the unit choose a place to place the housing of 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.569
 fixed control 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.930
 find a stable location near the battery but not too close to a 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.589
 heat source 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.029
 I did not fix it right now 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.639
 then lift the battery cover 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.819
 it is strongly advised to remove the negative cable from the battery before 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.339
 start with girls 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.869
 start with paul been the red thread at the positive pole in ten years solidly 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.329
 connect the black film to the negative pole in the same way 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:03.079
 to finish linking the queues done is first passed through the stirrups on 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.429
 the calenders then 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.429
 place them around the body on both sides of the vehicle 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.949
 to keep them and avoid the surfaces features 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.199
 the deaf heat and the moving parts 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.149
 put the grille on the front of the car but do not fix the modules drm 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.759
 on the stirrups 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.759
 this will be the last step 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.180
 find the location of the position light circuit by disbursing 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.409
 of the assembly of the front lights 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.540
 then identify the right wire using a tester 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.519
 automatic 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.659
 you can also use the physical control box that 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.659
 will indicate the right thread by a myriad of late levi 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 do not forget to turn off the position lights 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.909
 attached the pressure connector over the position light and make sure 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.909
 that it is securely fixed 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.419
 be sure to secure the fixed control box 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.569
 to replace the battery cover 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.569
 and to connect the two modules brl 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.849
 you can now test the lamps by starting the engine 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.940
 after making sure everything is working well 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.940
 you can fix drl modules 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.889
 to finish tie the remaining wires with provided cords and tighten the 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.889
 body panels loosen if necessary 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.559
 your new lamps are now installed 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.259
 you can now drive with visibility and increased safety 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.099
 you can admire the new look of your car 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.380

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.280
