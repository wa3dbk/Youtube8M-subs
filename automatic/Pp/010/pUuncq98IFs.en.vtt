 mavuba and welcome to this tray 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 edition this is an event that is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 finally any young second edition 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.820
 and yet you already announce heavy 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
 if I can say 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 big sick body also yannick 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.020
 noah talent that makes a mark in this 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.329
 moment marc lavoine amel bent we quoted 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010
 it's a poster worthy of the victories of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 the music 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.590
 yes it's true we have luck 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.239
 to have a nice plateau 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.699
 I think we'll know a little bit too 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.100
 on the on the first edition which has 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.960
 a success we are good echoes and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 we thought we had to choose 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.939
 republish that then parallel you 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.360
 invite comedians equally well 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.520
 sure your friends your soccer buddy the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.890
 solidarity exists among footballers 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 yes it exists for sure we see it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 not all the time but 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 but in any case I'm lucky 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.400
 to have some sense teammates 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.560
 of a friend and they will be present 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.200
 because mathieu debuchy and the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 godfather of this assault is and in addition 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.990
 for him it will be an opportunity to review the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.970
 public to whom she will tell me goodbye 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.580
 and then eden hazard will be there too adil 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.560
 all former colleagues of the losc year 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.020
 last we'll see it on these images 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.550
 you pushed the ditty 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:56.010
 it was alongside neil benneton 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:58.320
 look at that is what we will have the opportunity 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.660
 again this year at rio mavuba from you 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 hear singing with pleasure maybe 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.850
 maybe i would ask marc 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.710
 super closed lavender of the recluse 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.850
 so deductively surprised I imagine the year 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.979
 last announces you is a surprise 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.209
 a posted head was it was patrick 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.890
 bruel yeah yeah 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.910
 I imagine that this year again there is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.990
 will have surprises we will not 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.380
 unveil but what can we have 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.870
 tracks 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.390
 yeah but I think a cut of the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.830
 north which very well known who will be there also 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.269

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.860
 we did it they did just right 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.180
 in the pleasure of joining us but 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.400
 I think people will know that he 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.830
 know very well last year you have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 gathered 7000 people in a zenith of 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.870
 lille who was drunk with 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.660
 so surprises and we all go from 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.180
 then watched the teaser the tape 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.180
 announcement of the 2013 edition 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.510
 so the purpose of this concert is good 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.670
 sure 2 to please the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.650
 spectators to have fun you 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.810
 also and especially to harvest 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 funds for your association that 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.350
 exists since 2000 the nine it is about 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.750
 makala children orphans very 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.600
 precisely from makala last year you 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.130
 have raised 47 thousand euros I imagine that 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.850
 you tried to go a little bit more 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.710
 far again this year 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.410
 of course that's the goal it's 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.070
 fill the zenith that we count on the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.780
 solidarity of the people of the people of 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 Lille people and northerners in 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 general because here we have we have a 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.580
 very specific objective 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.709
 for sure it's going to be a beautiful 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.460
 evening and manpower the most important 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.860
 it's from 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.690
 now we are raising money for 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.810
 ab to help the terminal then you have 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.670
 in this kinshasa orphanage in the congo 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.410
 thirty children we will see 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.100
 some images we have the images so there 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.970
 of the orphanage where you are your project 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.000
 rio mavuba 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.190
 but here we can see when the new 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.510
 orphanage thanks to concerts 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.760
 the last one that allowed us to 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.500
 move and welcome them in 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.600
 other good the pool is not it 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.770
 part of them but to see them on 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.500
 can take them to recreation that's like 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.480
 the pool as the day before the losc but 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.530
 at his start was kind enough to take 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.240
 the extent 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.910
 the goal is to continue to 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.160
 increase the number of children also to 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.140
 create the ways we want to buy 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.540
 land so that for children 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.510
 learn to cultivate that and that the 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.160
 auto sauce is self-sufficient so these are 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.960
 short-term goals and also of 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.970
 make a second building to be able to 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.080
 separate girls and boys the purpose of 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.000
 the association is what it is 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.130
 schooling is the education of its 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.540
 orphaned children exactly those voices there 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.380
 and it is to offer them a childhood 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.220
 normal simply 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.440
 this is schooling we also wipe as 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.060
 we saw earlier on leisure 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.720
 we also follow them on the hygiene of life 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.970
 the health 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.380
 that is a good education and we 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.120
 accompany them until they have 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.020
 also a job and that he succeeds in 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.720
 find an apartment 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.660
 finally poorly classified housing is a 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.760
 neighborhood in kinshasa in congo you 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.650
 you 're grown up anyway 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.370
 in France you went to Congo I 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.740
 believe it was when you were going saying 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.720
 what effect did it make you 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.940
 memories you really keep true that 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.600
 it was a bit vague but that I am 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.680
 gone to 10 years of course that's it you feel 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.370
 that you are elsewhere than in France because 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.320
 that I have always grown up in France 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.050
 because on the roads and its 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.040
 terraces and it's really different 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.540
 after no I will keep this side 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.830
 warm because at the time good I want 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.030
 already at football and suddenly everyone 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.340
 play football so suddenly played that all 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.960
 kids like that it was for me a 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.470
 very good hold then after I had the 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.020
 chance to return since I 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.910
 the association ela with the return is a 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.350
 little bit more painful because with 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.660
 the age one is aware of what is happening 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.670
 there and that's not easy 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.100
 very well thank you very much anyway if 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.050
 coma or not to have come on this plateau 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.130
 I remember that the night in makala will be 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.170
 April 8 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.700
 we can already buy the places well 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.370
 obviously it turns around 25 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.050
 30 euros for the benefit of the association 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.840

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.890

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.900
