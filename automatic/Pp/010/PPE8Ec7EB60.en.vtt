00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
nothing you just put money in front of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.960 
nothing you just put money in front of
person<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.960> choose<00:00:28.320> between<00:00:29.010> garden<00:00:29.699> money

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
person to choose between garden money

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.750 
person to choose between garden money
and<00:00:30.179> they'll<00:00:30.359> choose<00:00:30.720> money<00:00:31.679> every<00:00:32.610> time

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.389 

because<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.420> suffering<00:00:36.950> fear<00:00:37.950> pain

no money because they know every human
being<00:00:43.590> new<00:00:44.100> God<00:00:44.850> never<00:00:45.270> answers<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> prayers

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
being new God never answers the prayers

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.310 
being new God never answers the prayers
it's<00:00:46.770> money<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> answer<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:47.879> prayers<00:00:48.320> but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's money that answer your prayers but
then<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.829> always<00:00:50.160> say<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.640> mean<00:00:52.039> God<00:00:53.039> sent

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
then you can always say I mean God sent

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180 
then you can always say I mean God sent
me<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> money<00:00:54.030> without<00:00:54.809> proof<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.800> blame

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
me the money without proof you can blame

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.370 
me the money without proof you can blame
that<00:00:57.590> obviously

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

but<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.520> itself<00:01:03.020> has<00:01:04.020> been<00:01:04.800> part<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.250> the

even a believe that infinity exists and
that<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.740> will<00:01:31.920> eventually<00:01:32.850> find<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.810> way

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
that one will eventually find your way

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.680 
that one will eventually find your way
through<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.760> go<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
through all of this if you go and do the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.080 
through all of this if you go and do the
quality<00:01:37.229> equation<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.670> basic

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
quality equation you do your basic

quality equation you do your basic
mathematics<00:01:39.660> you'll<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.200> impossible

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
mathematics you'll see it is impossible

mathematics you'll see it is impossible
to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.550> out<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.060> unless<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.080> stop<00:01:43.500> and

to get out of this unless you stop and

that is here to heal with therefore we

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.310 
that is here to heal with therefore we
say<00:01:53.390> equal<00:01:54.390> money<00:01:55.160> it<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> quickest<00:01:57.060> way

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
say equal money it is the quickest way

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.380

come out and for the opposition's to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
come out and for the opposition's to
show<00:02:06.060> their<00:02:06.360> face<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:07.289> we<00:02:07.440> can<00:02:07.649> deal<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.220> them

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399

show their face so we can deal with them
it<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.740> pretty<00:02:11.100> face<00:02:11.490> for

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
it is not going to be a pretty face for

it is not going to be a pretty face for
a<00:02:11.880> little<00:02:12.090> while<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:13.319> once<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.610> done
