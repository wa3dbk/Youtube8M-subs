myself so I can match paint swatches and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.949 
myself so I can match paint swatches and
fabric<00:02:14.140> samples

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
fabric samples

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.690 
fabric samples
anything<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.159> even<00:02:18.370> work<00:02:18.519> with

anything and and I can even work with
you<00:02:18.849> on<00:02:18.879> on<00:02:19.209> some<00:02:19.510> design<00:02:19.840> features<00:02:20.349> as<00:02:20.590> well

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769

even just the rosebuds on some of your
some<00:02:30.159> of<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.400> work<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.790> signature

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
some of your work is that a signature

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.910 
some of your work is that a signature
yeah<00:02:33.189> definitely<00:02:34.150> very<00:02:34.629> cool<00:02:34.930> that's<00:02:35.620> how<00:02:35.859> you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
know that's how you know if you see a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.879 
know that's how you know if you see a
rosebud<00:02:39.629> okay<00:02:40.629> but<00:02:40.810> what<00:02:40.959> about<00:02:40.989> working<00:02:41.379> so

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
rosebud okay but what about working so

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.649 
rosebud okay but what about working so
we<00:02:41.980> talked<00:02:42.189> about<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.519> polymer<00:02:42.849> clay<00:02:43.120> what

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
we talked about the polymer clay what

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.199 
we talked about the polymer clay what
about<00:02:43.870> when<00:02:44.109> you're<00:02:44.260> working<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.849> stones<00:02:45.849> is

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
about when you're working with stones is

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.089 
about when you're working with stones is
this<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.689> a<00:02:46.840> semi-precious<00:02:47.439> stone<00:02:47.829> that<00:02:48.069> you

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
this like a semi-precious stone that you

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.629 
this like a semi-precious stone that you
yeah<00:02:48.670> those<00:02:48.849> are<00:02:49.030> semi-precious<00:02:49.540> stones<00:02:50.019> and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
yeah those are semi-precious stones and

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.550 
yeah those are semi-precious stones and
so<00:02:51.639> again<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.329> future<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.019> polymer<00:02:53.409> clay

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
so again the future is the polymer clay

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.190 
so again the future is the polymer clay
as<00:02:53.859> you<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.189> here<00:02:54.489> yes

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
as you see here yes

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.440 
as you see here yes
yeah<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.379> beads<00:02:56.620> are<00:02:57.040> worked<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.609> between<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
yeah the beads are worked in between the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.589 
yeah the beads are worked in between the
sterling<00:02:59.260> silver<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.639> flat<00:03:00.819> sterling<00:03:01.269> silver

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
sterling silver the flat sterling silver

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.979 
sterling silver the flat sterling silver
pieces<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.919> beads<00:03:03.069> are<00:03:03.250> made<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.669> then

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
pieces so the beads are made and then

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.839 
pieces so the beads are made and then
once<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.200> pieces<00:03:05.409> baked<00:03:06.189> because<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.700> gets

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
once the pieces baked because it gets

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.770 
once the pieces baked because it gets
baked<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.209> harden<00:03:07.769> then<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:09.480> work<00:03:10.480> with<00:03:10.659> the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
baked to harden then I work with the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.170 
baked to harden then I work with the
stones<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.500> sterling<00:03:11.859> silver<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.730> russki

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
stones the sterling silver this russki

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.289 
stones the sterling silver this russki
crystal<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:13.959> beat<00:03:14.620> them<00:03:14.769> together<00:03:14.950> in<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.430> nice

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.119 
crystal and beat them together in a nice
fashion<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.930> create<00:03:17.049> bracelets<00:03:17.620> necklaces

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
fashion to create bracelets necklaces

I'm<00:03:29.799> starting<00:03:30.220> with<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.389> a<00:03:31.629> base<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.409> I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
I'm starting with this is a base that I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.240 
I'm starting with this is a base that I
use<00:03:32.769> for<00:03:33.129> one<00:03:33.609> of<00:03:33.760> my<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.650> my<00:03:35.769> pendant

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
use for one of my one of my pendant

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.759 
use for one of my one of my pendant
designs<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.120> actually<00:03:37.299> make<00:03:37.690> these<00:03:37.930> bases

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
designs and I actually make these bases

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.909 
designs and I actually make these bases
myself<00:03:39.190> because<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.609> wasn't<00:03:39.849> able<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.090> find<00:03:40.479> it

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
myself because I wasn't able to find it

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.420 
myself because I wasn't able to find it
in<00:03:41.919> a<00:03:42.159> retail<00:03:42.340> environment<00:03:43.979> so<00:03:44.979> I<00:03:45.010> make<00:03:45.250> this

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
in a retail environment so I make this

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.530 
in a retail environment so I make this
easy<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.479> start<00:03:46.930> with<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:47.109> and<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:49.030> this<00:03:49.329> is

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
easy I start with that and then this is

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.379 
easy I start with that and then this is
some<00:03:50.109> of<00:03:50.229> the<00:03:50.290> clay<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.769> use<00:03:51.010> here<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.549> the

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
some of the clay that I use here and the

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.509 
some of the clay that I use here and the
clay<00:03:52.629> it<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.139> come<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.470> pre-mixed<00:03:54.040> colors

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
clay it just come in pre-mixed colors

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.309 
clay it just come in pre-mixed colors
but<00:03:55.180> they're<00:03:55.299> really<00:03:55.419> quite<00:03:55.690> bright<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:55.989> like

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
but they're really quite bright I like

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.369 
but they're really quite bright I like
to<00:03:56.530> think<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.280> them<00:03:57.430> as<00:03:57.459> like<00:03:58.419> almost<00:03:59.169> like<00:03:59.319> a

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
to think of them as like almost like a

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.309 
to think of them as like almost like a
block<00:03:59.650> box<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.310> crayons<00:04:01.060> oh<00:04:01.239> right<00:04:02.049> they're

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
block box of crayons oh right they're

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.110 
block box of crayons oh right they're
quite<00:04:02.530> vibrant<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.220> I'll<00:04:03.340> take<00:04:03.549> them<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.970> mix
