wrong I do like the iOS 7 update and
generally<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.690> most<00:00:13.080> things<00:00:13.200> about<00:00:13.440> it

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
generally I like most things about it

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.170 
generally I like most things about it
but<00:00:14.010> one<00:00:14.130> thing<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.550> don't<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
but one thing I really don't like is the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.120 
but one thing I really don't like is the
calendar<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.139> sure<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.560> alone<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.010> this

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
but even if you do like the application

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.270 
but even if you do like the application
who<00:00:18.930> knows<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.320> may<00:00:19.440> find<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.800> better<00:00:19.890> one<00:00:20.100> in

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
a different application let us know

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
a different application let us know
about<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:28.890> well<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.820> I'm<00:00:29.940> using<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
about that as well so I'm using the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.730 
about that as well so I'm using the
calendar<00:00:30.600> application<00:00:31.020> for<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.230> time

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
calendar application for the first time

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.620 
calendar application for the first time
I<00:00:31.770> did<00:00:32.039> really<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.579> clean<00:00:32.790> design<00:00:33.180> but

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I did really like the clean design but

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.670 
I did really like the clean design but
the<00:00:33.690> thing<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.170> didn't<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.470> was<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the thing I really didn't like was a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
the thing I really didn't like was a
lack<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> different<00:00:35.399> views<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.790> could<00:00:35.940> have

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
lack of different views you could have

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.180 
lack of different views you could have
to<00:00:36.270> view<00:00:36.450> calendar<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.470> for<00:00:37.710> example<00:00:38.070> you've

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to view calendar so for example you've

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
to view calendar so for example you've
got<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.340> day<00:00:38.610> view<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.059> person<00:00:39.480> doesn't

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
got this day view which person doesn't

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
got this day view which person doesn't

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

doesn't give you enough information a
glance<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:55.050> thing<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.290> do<00:00:55.350> miss<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.829> iOS

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
glance one thing I do miss from the iOS

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
glance one thing I do miss from the iOS
6<00:00:56.430> calendar<00:00:56.820> application<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.510> ListView

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
6 calendar application was the ListView

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
6 calendar application was the ListView
now<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:58.829> totally<00:00:59.399> absent<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.879> iOS<00:01:00.149> 7

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
now it's not totally absent in iOS 7

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.520 
now it's not totally absent in iOS 7
because<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.020> bring<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.320> by<00:01:01.500> just

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
because you can bring it up by just

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170 
because you can bring it up by just
hitting<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> search<00:01:02.219> board<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.000> kind

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
hitting the search board but it's kind

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
hitting the search board but it's kind
of<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> clunky<00:01:03.660> way<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> bring<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> ListView<00:01:04.710> up

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of a clunky way to bring the ListView up

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
of a clunky way to bring the ListView up
in<00:01:05.129> i/o<00:01:05.400> 6<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.970> could<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> ListView

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in i/o 6 you could have the ListView

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
in i/o 6 you could have the ListView
showing<00:01:06.930> by<00:01:07.020> default<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.770> much

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
showing by default which I much

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
showing by default which I much
preferred<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.909> there's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> few<00:01:09.270> other<00:01:09.420> reasons

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
preferred so there's a few other reasons

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.060 
preferred so there's a few other reasons
why<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> didn't<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> application<00:01:10.440> but<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
why I didn't like the application but I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
why I didn't like the application but I
don't<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.340> ramble<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.729> too<00:01:11.850> much<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
don't know ramble on too much about that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.149 
don't know ramble on too much about that
let's<00:01:13.290> concentrate<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
let's concentrate more on the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.219 
let's concentrate more on the
alternatives<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.510> video<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.020> showing

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
alternatives so in this video is showing

alternatives so in this video is showing

extremely cheap and want free
application<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.520> liked<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.790> well

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
application which I really liked as well

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
application which I really liked as well
one<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.930> want<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> make<00:01:22.170> clear<00:01:22.229> on

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
one thing I do want to make clear on

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.420 
one thing I do want to make clear on
before<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> show<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.250> three

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
before I show you these three

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.640 
before I show you these three
applications<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.780> free<00:01:25.080> work<00:01:25.350> fine

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
applications is that are free work fine

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
applications is that are free work fine
with<00:01:25.680> iCloud<00:01:26.340> calendar<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> also<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> Google

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
with iCloud calendar and also the Google

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
with iCloud calendar and also the Google
Calendar<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.040> applications<00:01:29.640> will<00:01:29.820> sync

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
Calendar so these applications will sync

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
Calendar so these applications will sync
up<00:01:30.180> fine<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> default<00:01:31.110> calendar<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
up fine with the default calendar and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.460 
up fine with the default calendar and
also<00:01:32.100> sync<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.330> devices

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
also sync up with all your other devices

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
also sync up with all your other devices
perfectly<00:01:34.470> fine<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.430> no<00:01:35.520> reason<00:01:35.880> why

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
perfectly fine so there's no reason why

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.190 
perfectly fine so there's no reason why
these<00:01:36.060> applications<00:01:36.780> can't<00:01:37.080> be<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
these applications can't be a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
these applications can't be a
replacement<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> default<00:01:38.490> app<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
replacement for the default app so the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
replacement for the default app so the
first<00:01:39.659> application<00:01:40.350> I'm<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.650> show<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
first application I'm going to show you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.530 
first application I'm going to show you
is<00:01:40.979> agenda<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> calendar

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
is agenda now this is a calendar

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
is agenda now this is a calendar
application<00:01:42.750> I've<00:01:43.350> been<00:01:43.560> using<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.400> few

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
application I've been using for a few

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.100 
application I've been using for a few
days<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.960> now

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
days now and I really like it now

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.630 
days now and I really like it now
probably<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> main<00:01:46.799> reason<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
probably the main reason like it is it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
probably the main reason like it is it's
very<00:01:47.790> minimal<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.540> does<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.930> list<00:01:49.140> view

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
very minimal it does have that list view

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.840 
very minimal it does have that list view
which<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.619> personally<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.280> with

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
which I personally really like with

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
which I personally really like with
agenda<00:01:51.240> being<00:01:51.390> quite<00:01:51.630> minimal<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.200> does<00:01:52.380> fit

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
agenda being quite minimal it does fit

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
agenda being quite minimal it does fit
in<00:01:52.650> very<00:01:52.770> well<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.009> iOS<00:01:53.460> 7<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.060> iOS

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
in very well with iOS 7 it's got the iOS

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
in very well with iOS 7 it's got the iOS
7<00:01:54.540> look<00:01:54.780> about<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.560> funny<00:01:55.770> enough<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
7 look about it and funny enough this

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.590 
7 look about it and funny enough this
application<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.909> been<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> number<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
application has been out a number of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
application has been out a number of
years<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.079> definitely<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.439> iOS<00:01:58.740> 7

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
years so it's definitely on iOS 7

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
years so it's definitely on iOS 7
inspired<00:01:59.369> even<00:01:59.790> though<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> does<00:02:00.329> look<00:02:00.479> very

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
inspired even though it does look very

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109 
inspired even though it does look very
similar<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:02.009> thing<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.970> it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
similar now one thing we know is that it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.760 
similar now one thing we know is that it
has<00:02:03.240> got<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.570> above<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> fun<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
has got more above the fun about it so

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.950 
has got more above the fun about it so
it's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:04.979> 100%<00:02:05.310> iOS<00:02:05.909> 7<00:02:06.180> looking<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.869> it's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's not 100% iOS 7 looking but it's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.569 
it's not 100% iOS 7 looking but it's
pretty<00:02:07.110> damn<00:02:07.290> close<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.159> does<00:02:08.279> lead<00:02:08.429> me

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
pretty damn close so that does lead me

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:09.830 
pretty damn close so that does lead me
to<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> impression<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.419> developer

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to the impression that the developer

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.989 
to the impression that the developer
walked<00:02:10.019> out<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.409> application<00:02:10.559> soon<00:02:11.189> or<00:02:11.700> even

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:11.999 
walked out this application soon or even

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.580 
walked out this application soon or even
bring<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.269> new<00:02:12.540> app<00:02:12.719> so<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.409> said<00:02:13.559> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
bring out a new app so as I said I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.059 
bring out a new app so as I said I
really<00:02:13.680> like

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
really like

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.619 
really like
simple<00:02:14.370> design<00:02:14.609> and<00:02:14.640> application<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.480> also

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
simple design and application I also

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.599 
simple design and application I also
like<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.260> controls<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.920> doesn't<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> very

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
like the controls it doesn't do a very

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.699 
like the controls it doesn't do a very

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
calendar application is when I'm

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.509 
calendar application is when I'm
actually<00:03:45.989> entering<00:03:46.709> event<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.129> like<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.459> be

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
actually entering event I like it to be

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.369 
actually entering event I like it to be
really<00:03:47.699> simple<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.299> quick<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:49.109> find<00:03:49.319> this

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
really simple and quick and I find this

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.649 
really simple and quick and I find this
application<00:03:50.040> does<00:03:50.069> do<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.609> pretty<00:03:50.790> well<00:03:51.120> so

much rehearsal as you can see there and

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.100 
much rehearsal as you can see there and
to<00:06:14.820> add<00:06:14.970> an<00:06:15.120> event<00:06:15.240> you<00:06:15.539> just<00:06:15.720> hit<00:06:15.870> one<00:06:15.960> of<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
to add an event you just hit one of the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.840 
to add an event you just hit one of the
plus<00:06:16.289> signs<00:06:16.560> next<00:06:16.740> to<00:06:17.070> one<00:06:17.190> of<00:06:17.220> the<00:06:17.310> days<00:06:17.520> and

plus signs next to one of the days and

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.409 
plus signs next to one of the days and
then<00:06:18.300> we<00:06:18.389> can<00:06:18.570> type<00:06:18.900> in<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.139> title<00:06:19.320> and<00:06:19.860> also<00:06:20.760> put

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
then we can type in a title and also put

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.080 
then we can type in a title and also put
in<00:06:21.539> our<00:06:21.690> time<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.139> date<00:06:22.380> for<00:06:23.070> our<00:06:23.100> event<00:06:23.430> so<00:06:24.030> it

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
in our time and date for our event so it

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.969 
in our time and date for our event so it
works<00:06:24.270> pretty<00:06:24.570> well<00:06:24.720> so<00:06:25.110> that's<00:06:25.710> a<00:06:25.830> quick

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
works pretty well so that's a quick

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.159 
works pretty well so that's a quick
overview<00:06:26.310> of<00:06:26.520> simple<00:06:27.210> calendar<00:06:27.510> at<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.870> tail

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.700 
suggest it's a very simple calendar
which<00:06:30.360> I<00:06:30.479> think<00:06:30.690> would<00:06:30.870> be<00:06:30.900> perfect<00:06:31.169> for<00:06:31.440> a<00:06:31.560> lot

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
which I think would be perfect for a lot

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.050 
which I think would be perfect for a lot
of<00:06:31.740> people<00:06:32.130> because<00:06:32.400> some<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:32.910> other

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
of people because some of the other

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.490
