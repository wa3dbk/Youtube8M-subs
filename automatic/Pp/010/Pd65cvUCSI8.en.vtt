they recorded it in the studio and

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
they recorded it in the studio and
usually<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:19.650> live<00:01:20.650> they'll<00:01:20.980> tune<00:01:21.159> lower

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
usually that is live they'll tune lower

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it drops the overall pitch so this is

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.120 
it drops the overall pitch so this is
off<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:28.060> actual<00:01:28.600> CD<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.170> studio<00:01:29.470> version<00:01:29.680> ok
