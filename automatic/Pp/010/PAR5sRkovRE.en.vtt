00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:15.660
 well we are today trying to search 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.280
 a pretty interesting way under a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.470
 clinical point of view 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.470
 of how to achieve in this system 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.600
 double 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.800
 skull, mandibular, vertebral skull 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
 a condition that we talk about 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.900
 usually from a resting condition 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.280
 physiological that is a position of minor 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.250
 joint internal pressure lower tension 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 capsular ligament and the position of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.900
 Less muscle tension with an activity 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.519
 biographical electro decreased to 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.000
 allow movements 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.850
 three-dimensional both of the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.180
 temporomandibular joint as of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 vertebral skull joints 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.920
 which are the great elements that are 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.409
 related with 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.569
 headache 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.270
 dor facial and progressive pathologies 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:24.400
 the joints synovium is 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.640
 temporomandibular and vertebral skull 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.030
 how do we visualize this system the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 Common system is the position of the skull 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.060
 and the position of the skull 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 it is a 50-50 system ie the skull 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.590
 It works with a 50% type of relationship 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.140
 mandibular skull and 50% with a relationship 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.150
 vertebral skull therefore when 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.230
 we do in our patients 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.660
 usual who attend the clinic 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.200
 with pain joint noises 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.570
 articulate irradiated pains to different 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.950
 areas of the skull and face 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.930
 and we only make a previous vision 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.790
 we are doing 50 percent of the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.390
 diagnosis 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.599
 and this same case that comes with pain 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 facial joint problems and also 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:29.530
 a headache that is characterized in the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.560
 greater process as an occipital headache 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.959
 supraorbital is an altered relationship 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.379
 between the skull and the cervical spine 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.590
 superior that is the one that performs 50 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.459
 cent of the normal function of the head 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.090
 and the pesso therefore we are in a 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.569
 dynamic system with a lot of influence 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.079
 clinic skull vertebral skull 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.079
 mandibular this relationship is called 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.440
 through a core system 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.390
 trigeminal cervical 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.590
 where the roots and seminals 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:13.450
 seminal supraorbital 1 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.660
 the facial weaves that germinal 2 and the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.660
 mandibular criminal 3 have a 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.569
 direct relationship through the core 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.750
 caudal with cervical roots 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.540
 superiors that are born at the level of 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.910
 cervical spine between the occipital and the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.209
 first cervical vertebra behind the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:39.090
 first cervical root corresponds to the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 first trigeminal root 1 the second root 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.970
 cervical between the atlas and the axis 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:50.480
 corresponds to a relationship 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:54.390
 with trigeminal 2 and cervical 3 root 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.470
 which corresponds to segment c2 c3 has 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.650
 a relationship with the mandibular branch 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.380
 trigeminal therefore from the point of 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.960
 clinical view we must do the concept 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.160
 differential diagnosis skull 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.590
 vertebral in cases of headaches and two 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.570
 facial and we have to do the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.700
 differential diagnosis skull 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.489
 mandibular and joint 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.160
 temporomandibular when we have the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.130
 same or similar pathology and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.530
 symptomatology of a skull relationship 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.690
 posterior vertebral therefore we are 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.470
 looking for a way to do a job 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.590
 interdisciplinary 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.290
 the dentist with his type management 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.500
 mandibular skull with its handling 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.950
 orthopedic temporomandibular with its 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.280
 relationship of an oral rehabilitation that 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.980
 give stability to this system 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.740
 previous for us to be able to work from 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.140
 a skeletal muscle point of view 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.740
 the joints synovium is skulls 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.510
 vertebral to look for this balance 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.210
 later with this previous equilibrium 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.610
 the relationship of the occipital with the first 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.170
 cervical vertebra clarifies the relationship of 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.860
 the classe with the second vertebra 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.569
 cervical 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.479
 axis and how 2 is articulated with c 3 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.909
 this space and this relationship of the 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.270
 upper cervical column has a 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:27.749
 intimate relationship with the type function 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.649
 mandibular skull I invite you to know 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:34.559
