interesting if not a tad bit off-putting
at<00:00:33.780> times<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.500> nonetheless<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.399> kind<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
at times but nonetheless it's kind of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
at times but nonetheless it's kind of
interesting<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> actual<00:00:37.440> my

interesting so as for the actual my
quality<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> noticed<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.110> it's<00:00:40.110> better<00:00:40.410> than

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770

I<00:00:57.020> typically<00:00:58.020> use<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.789> chatting

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I typically use this for just chatting

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
I typically use this for just chatting
with<00:01:00.270> friends<00:01:00.420> even<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> cell<00:01:01.559> phone<00:01:01.829> well

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
with friends even on the cell phone well

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
with friends even on the cell phone well
especially<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> cell<00:01:03.449> phone<00:01:03.690> I've<00:01:04.320> use<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
especially on the cell phone I've use it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.100 
especially on the cell phone I've use it
for<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.220> also<00:01:05.939> did<00:01:06.180> notice<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.869> cell

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
for that I also did notice that the cell

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
for that I also did notice that the cell
phone<00:01:07.320> quality<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.010> better<00:01:08.729> than<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.360> mic

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
phone quality is better than the mic

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
phone quality is better than the mic
quality<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.560> talking<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> friends

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
quality when I'm just talking to friends

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
quality when I'm just talking to friends
on<00:01:11.700> PSN<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.659> even<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.020> recording<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> audio

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
on PSN or even just recording this audio

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.330 
on PSN or even just recording this audio
so<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.630> audio<00:01:15.630> itself<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> hollow

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so the audio itself is kind of hollow

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.780 
so the audio itself is kind of hollow
sounding<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:19.320> sounds<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.580> as

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
sounding it sounds a little bit like as

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
sounding it sounds a little bit like as
if<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.119> far<00:01:21.390> away<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> headset<00:01:22.020> even

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
if I'm far away from the headset even

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
if I'm far away from the headset even
though<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.640> could<00:01:23.850> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
though I'm not now that could be

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.460 
though I'm not now that could be
attributed<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> microphone<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
attributed to the microphone which is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710 
attributed to the microphone which is
built-in<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> left<00:01:26.610> Cup<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.390> actually

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
built-in to the left Cup it's actually

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.140 
built-in to the left Cup it's actually
how<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:28.320> underneath<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.150> right

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
how it's right underneath the right

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
how it's right underneath the right
underneath<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.750> left<00:01:31.110> faceplate<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
underneath the left faceplate so if you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.660 
underneath the left faceplate so if you
pulled<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> pull<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.340> pull<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
pulled the if you pull the you pull it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.069

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
your cup down a little bit you can see a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.420 
your cup down a little bit you can see a
little<00:01:37.259> hole<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:37.770> should<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.189> where<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
little hole which should be where the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
little hole which should be where the
microphone<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.750> again<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.259> has<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> little
