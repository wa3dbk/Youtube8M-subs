00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
instead of it being I think 120 it's now

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.900 
instead of it being I think 120 it's now
140

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910

and jump off like right here and then go

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:09.350 
and jump off like right here and then go
for<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.060> guy<00:03:04.160> then<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.820> there<00:03:08.209> try<00:03:09.209> and

can't<00:03:14.100> do<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.280> then<00:03:14.580> you're<00:03:14.790> gonna<00:03:15.030> probably

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
can't do that then you're gonna probably

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:28.900 
can't do that then you're gonna probably
lose<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.739> challenge<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.130> gold

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
reason so I jumped down and I got this

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.140 
reason so I jumped down and I got this
guy<00:03:34.160> instead<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:37.280> get<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.790> guy<00:03:37.970> though

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
guy instead I do get this guy though

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.020 
guy instead I do get this guy though
luckily<00:03:38.990> and<00:03:39.410> I've<00:03:40.070> eaten<00:03:40.280> my<00:03:40.430> personal<00:03:40.820> best

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
luckily and I've eaten my personal best

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.330 
luckily and I've eaten my personal best
but<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.440> was<00:03:42.620> kind<00:03:42.800> of<00:03:42.860> lucky

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
but that was kind of lucky

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.730 
but that was kind of lucky
usually<00:03:44.150> if<00:03:44.420> he's<00:03:44.750> not<00:03:44.900> alerted<00:03:45.290> triangle

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
usually if he's not alerted triangle

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.500 
usually if he's not alerted triangle
across<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.190> beam<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.610> get<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.030> top<00:03:47.330> guy

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
across the beam and get that top guy

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.210 
across the beam and get that top guy
first<00:03:47.720> then<00:03:47.930> jump<00:03:48.290> down<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.560> assassinate<00:03:49.070> the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
first then jump down and assassinate the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:59.430 
first then jump down and assassinate the
other<00:03:49.340> guy

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.330 

now<00:04:00.010> for<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.280> freerunning<00:04:00.790> activities<00:04:01.240> a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
now for the freerunning activities a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.590 
now for the freerunning activities a
short<00:04:03.340> course<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:06.100> probably<00:04:06.730> easier<00:04:07.180> than<00:04:07.240> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
short course is probably easier than the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:16.020 
short course is probably easier than the
Leafs<00:04:07.990> tutorial<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.710> think<00:04:14.430> my<00:04:15.430> personal<00:04:15.910> best

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
Leafs tutorial I think my personal best

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:29.690 
Leafs tutorial I think my personal best
time<00:04:16.330> is<00:04:16.540> 32<00:04:16.930> seconds<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:18.130> 47

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:39.450 

and<00:04:30.180> yeah<00:04:30.720> this<00:04:30.960> one's<00:04:31.170> very<00:04:31.320> easy<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.920> think

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.420 

I<00:04:40.229> don't<00:04:41.229> know<00:04:41.289> why<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.470> did<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:41.949> that

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
I don't know why I did that but that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.680 
I don't know why I did that but that
slowed<00:04:42.669> down<00:04:42.880> my<00:04:42.970> time<00:04:43.150> if<00:04:43.330> you're<00:04:43.449> trying<00:04:43.630> to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
slowed down my time if you're trying to

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.360 
slowed down my time if you're trying to
go<00:04:43.780> for<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.020> fast<00:04:44.229> time<00:04:44.530> try<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:44.979> jump<00:04:45.160> on<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
go for a fast time try and jump on the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.620 
go for a fast time try and jump on the
roof<00:04:45.789> ahead<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.710> there<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:47.919> go<00:04:48.630> short

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
roof ahead of it and there you go short

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:57.120 
roof ahead of it and there you go short
course<00:04:49.930> one<00:04:50.169> training<00:04:50.500> completed<00:04:50.860> gold

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.030 

and<00:04:57.220> if<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.330> stuck<00:04:58.780> with<00:04:58.810> one<00:04:59.110> of<00:04:59.200> those<00:04:59.320> you

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
and if you stuck with one of those you

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.810 
and if you stuck with one of those you
can't<00:05:00.250> beat<00:05:00.460> it

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
can't beat it

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.570 
can't beat it
I<00:05:01.050> have<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.260> race<00:05:02.620> tutorial<00:05:03.070> left<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:04.450> try<00:05:04.690> I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
I have this race tutorial left to try I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.890 
I have this race tutorial left to try I
think<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.910> one's<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.300> one<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.750> hardest

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
think this one's like one of the hardest

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.590 
think this one's like one of the hardest
sometimes<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.650> got<00:05:08.890> hard<00:05:09.160> but<00:05:09.660> annoying

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
sometimes I got hard but annoying

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.000 
sometimes I got hard but annoying
because<00:05:13.600> if<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:13.930> make<00:05:14.110> like<00:05:14.320> one<00:05:14.650> mistake

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
because if you make like one mistake

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.580 
because if you make like one mistake
then<00:05:15.790> like<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:16.840> have<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:17.050> follow<00:05:17.230> all<00:05:17.440> the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590
