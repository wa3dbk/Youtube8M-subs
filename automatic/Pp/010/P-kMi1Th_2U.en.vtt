 perfect and well camouflaged without any 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 imperfection visible using the base

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 Look cool and radiant 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.960
 let's delve slightly and without 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.900

 I'm going to apply it on the mobile eyelid and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.800
 then we will trace a subtle to the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.590
 year between the upper lashes 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.100
 to fill them and give consistency to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.100
 the roots 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.840
 and we will apply the mask with the something 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.840
 extreme intense black 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.810
