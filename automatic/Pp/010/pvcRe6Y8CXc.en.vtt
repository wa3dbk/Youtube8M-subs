00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.030
 the 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.030
 j 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.079
 kyra nice viewers and is therefore a new video that shows how you m 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.710
 the cup victory makes a trend-setting 4 and she can be together 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.980
 you have 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.770
 and we will only be the first to create a folder limit to judgment yes you can 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.850
 call what you want 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.739
 I can also call it 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.669
 the server 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.700
 seven editions have four points 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.510
 that is then made we have a contract for a year this year 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.550
 then we want to get this 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.020
 very gladly 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.780
 and there are 4 so we are going to inhabit 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.840
 into the depth 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 points for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.480
 yes the homeland 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.680
 by this amount and workforce budget 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.220
 Look I have not yet understood the men 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.270
 and for windows year exists 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.000
 it is just this code is a toe injury but there are not yet 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.260
 and there it is Rev 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 i could click the red here the autonomous the cameras have been done to the effect of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.980
 this year is just growing steadily 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.090
 desktop 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.210
 then you just have it in the folder 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 and you should not mean it, but I immediately explain why 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.120
 copy once 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 because you need this for windows anp mc 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.630
 7 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.090
 for those people it is different than you need this code i just don't know how 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 to do the work there they still need to change things or something 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.250
 and for nec 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.050
 all stx is also different 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 I have no reason to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.780
 almost the same year 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.150
 you go but there are fewer present 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.790
 you buy this one 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.080
 but you make and 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.450
 text document 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.380
 I think so too 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.909
 to proclaim this nonsense that you must do it is the case 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.350
 i would have gotten nowhere that it had to be boys d i can't 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.739
 explain why 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.749
 marius that is powerful neighborhood touch has enterprise enemy 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.789
 nac must love this is must remember because you have to be yourself the 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.789
 take the supercup for comparison 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.939
 so became the actor 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.229
 master 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.769
 already deployed 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.239
 also this month 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.699
 tip 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.739
 you make here you can also start can poop can also server 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.959
 so I do easier inter the old point with successively just like that 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.469
 otherwise it won't work 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 state 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.989
 beijing I want this text to mean that 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.129
 and you can too 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.199
 and yes I have you again seven 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.369
 the voter 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.689
 you can join can be support for 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.000
 nh to see the purified tennis sisters in liessel 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.340
 and down 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.330
 Berlin 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.779
 this show how should the port for 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.369
 the 30 year old rider 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.429
 figuring out mdp in zealand 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.879
 and then you get this spicy detail if you are sure 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.089
 7days to just yourself 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.089
 and when you are here this does not sound too short 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.359
 and you look for the chain to know how to divide 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 agree that this coalition 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.219
 look at the pit this says prime minister 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.060
 these people have used 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.189
 that shrinkage 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.359
 also burnley this work already bol.com united 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.299
 we hope for your cooperation 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.299
 especially in Arnhem 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.769
 the herring 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.769
 he is different and i this government 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.969
 wind conditional 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.029
 and if you are here the 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.499
 are you looking for choose in d 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.489
 the index that to 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.819
 this is via the west 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.679
 floridienne 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.089
 that has been one 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.569
 heartbreaker 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.299
 and here the most experienced 2 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.779
 5 5 6 5 which is also just two hits 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.779
 52 percent rise 52 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.610
 sign that protocol 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.659
 I finally found him dead 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.659
 7 these two and later again 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.189
 and those other areas 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.189
 and who and ecolo wrote against that 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.900
 if it is right now then work when there are problems time always thought 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:54.229
 Every year we withdraw almost 65 percent of the information that you have 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.550
 according to the libian leader is here for you 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.550
 I like the two CDs and DVDs 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.809
 click here for a series 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.379
 have entered 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.430
 sevilla 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.180
 and with an ordinary one 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.110
 with all your friends inside 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.169
 empty handed 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.240
 and yes there are questions 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.889
 they are important 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.830
 then I'll take it like that 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.939
 cheer 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.939
 during his 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.999
 but if your friends pass through ns only for locally the papal award 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.999
 what is making 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.680
 immediately after the ek 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.030
 I did not share with many people because otherwise he will look at others 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.789
 to do things 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.370
 it is that 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.919
 yes, yes 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.710
 if this is not lighting the road 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.469
 Sunday had to see mark 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.469
 without any problem 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.900
 then be able to look and study such a map down 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.759
 we sat seems to me this period more through the questions are the matter 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.029
 later on
