 fifa game mode that will be 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.420
 inside the fifa ultimate team that is fut 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.869
 draft of the river consisting of football is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.699
 fertile 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.710
 football is going to be the way in which 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.900
 You're going to set up a team with players. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 that there will be giving away to you for each 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 position and you will have to try to win 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.199
 four straight games online 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.719
 obviously with that player actually 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.700
 not online but I do not know if it will have a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.670
 offline too I imagine it to be lonely 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.129
 online anyway you can win four 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.469
 consecutive matches with this team that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.719
 It will draw for you, every game is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.340
 some players in each position and the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.649
 trade the following way you go 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.670
 get into this mode I just have to pay 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.890
 15 million or 300 fifa bridge or a draft 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.170
 tolkien this draftou that by what there 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.399
 said you'll get pec too 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.989
 opening pecs 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.390
 you have to pay this entrance fee 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 of the championship but they said that even 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 that you lose already in the first match 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.180
 Even you did not win any games. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 you will receive an award that is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 an amount equivalent to the price of the entry 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.970
 that future soon as you are 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 paying 15 million 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.460
 I imagine that we will receive it will be 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.740
 a 15K pack with 11 a 15K pack or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 two 7,500 packages or three packages if 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.460
 I do not know, but he says he will. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 receive the award equivalent to the value 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.119
 entry but come you paid 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 entered and signed up for this 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.400
 championship 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.619
 the first thing you 're going to do is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.229
 if you choose a training for your team 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 he will get lucky information 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.310
 I do not know, I do not know. 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 finally it will decide information 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 random for you will choose the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.799
 information and you will get 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 you choose one of these 5 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.540
 then you chose 65 you do not have 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.310
 how to change after the formation of the formation 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.810
 that you have chosen will be the training you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.450
 you will have to use in all 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.399
 this matches this championship this 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.860
 your attempt to win 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.570
 futnet chose the beauty championship 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.819
 You will first choose the first one. 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.410
 player of his team that is going to be treated 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.810
 as 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.000
 then the captain of the team will be 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.520
 always the player from what I understand what 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.650
 they spoke will be the great star of the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.080
 So I think it's going to be a 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.090
 player with the summer a little higher 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.980
 It's going to be the guy who's probably going to have it. 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.360
 a bigger chance to have a more summer 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.490
 top of your team 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.640
 You 're going to choose this guy, okay now. 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.490
 you will choose the remaining positions 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.410
 It's the other ten players there to power. 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.080
 fill in your team then the others 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.620
 players he goes there if goalkeeper runs 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.840
 among these five goalkeepers five years 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.120
 how 25 right side cicinho 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.310
 left side, if you mount your 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.020
 team between five random players 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.540
 write about it in time for you 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.150
 can be a player can be a player 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 report can be up to a led player of 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.880
 in case you are obviously playing 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.400
 xbox one xbox 360 and had choose go 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.800
 raffle with your five player pecs 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.030
 random for you and pull off have these 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.040
 five people here for that position 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.880
 school there you have to choose that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.950
 player 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.540
 after you ride your team goes 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.790
 the same thing happens to the blood 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.620
 total of these five options first samba 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 options per second environment and 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.060
 then you assemble your team all over the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.950
 the most you can do is change the player 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.340
 position to try to improve a little 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.860
 more 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.410
 the chemistry of your team with the assembled team 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.390
 Then you leave the league and you? 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.150
 will have the mission say try to win 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.040
 four consecutive matches the most 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 far you are a better championship goes 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.330
 being the course award will win there and 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.660
 How are they saying the awards will be? 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.670
 very good and you won 44 wins and 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.560
 won the award very nice crisis 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.660
 where exactly what it will be but it 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.420
 It says it's going to be cool, basically. 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.190
 this will be the game mode a new mode 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.500
 in the future in the ultimate team 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.840
 despite the accession rate of about 15 thousand 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.890
 with that I found the idea interesting 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.630
 I think it's cool because it's a noel 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.090
 one more way you have to 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.800
 get awards different they say 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.770
 That the awards are good, let's see if it's good. 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.180
 even then it's a different thing there 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.310
 that we have to test 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.130
 different players different times 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.970
 different combinations player formations 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.739
 different 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.050
 sometimes even play with players with 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.730
 little chemistry at last I found a 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.410
 cool alternative I think the game mode 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.660
 interesting, what are you going to give us? 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.180
 one joking there will we know if it's worth 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.860
 sorry then clicks on there he said 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.960
 that this game mode is already available 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.600
 the launch of the game will no longer be a 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.090
 thing was selected then no then it is 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.910
 a good idea is a good idea is a 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.220
 idea that my opinion will add 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.170
 for the game mode let's know if the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.510
 prizes will be good enough to 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.730
 it's worth it to play this with 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.400
 frequency or not at all 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.290

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.410
 informative newspaper about fifa 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.240
 one of the things I think more 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.070
 that you find more important and 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.720
