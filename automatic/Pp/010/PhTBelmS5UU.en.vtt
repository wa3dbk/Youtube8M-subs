00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.680 
has metal in the middle so I'm going to
put<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.170> china<00:02:27.680> berries<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:28.459> as<00:02:28.730> an<00:02:29.420> accent<00:02:29.959> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
put it china berries in as an accent and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.210 
put it china berries in as an accent and
they're<00:02:32.690> looking<00:02:32.989> almost<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> cluster<00:02:34.040> of

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
they're looking almost like a cluster of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.750 
they're looking almost like a cluster of
grapes<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.000> then<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.900> further<00:02:36.230> enhance<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.940 

the<00:02:40.760> Nate<00:02:41.000> natural<00:02:41.630> field<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.470> wood<00:02:42.709> is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the Nate natural field in the wood is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.759 
the Nate natural field in the wood is
also<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.730> land<00:02:44.299> is<00:02:44.510> also<00:02:44.870> metals<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.620> I've

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
also in the land is also metals so I've

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.430 
also in the land is also metals so I've
made<00:02:46.010> some<00:02:46.370> round<00:02:47.060> forms<00:02:47.630> out<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.840> boo-yan

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
made some round forms out of boo-yan

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.210 
made some round forms out of boo-yan
wire<00:02:48.769> that<00:02:49.670> will<00:02:50.140> bring<00:02:51.140> your<00:02:51.350> eye<00:02:51.410> even

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
wire that will bring your eye even

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.070 
wire that will bring your eye even
further<00:02:52.549> down<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.690> another

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
further down and so just another

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.710 
further down and so just another
variation<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:55.070> color<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.580> texture<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
variation of color and texture and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.009 
variation of color and texture and
finish<00:02:57.260> our<00:02:57.470> design<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:58.820> have<00:02:59.000> an<00:02:59.180> expert<00:02:59.750> wire

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
finish our design we have an expert wire

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.080 
finish our design we have an expert wire
just<00:03:00.500> earned<00:03:00.709> expert<00:03:01.220> vine<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.790> as<00:03:01.970> an

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
just earned expert vine just as an

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.170 
just earned expert vine just as an
overlay<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:03.079> it's<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.769> go<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:05.060> the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
overlay and it's going to go in to the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.130 
overlay and it's going to go in to the
face<00:03:05.500> come<00:03:06.500> all<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:07.040> way<00:03:07.070> around<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.750> sort<00:03:09.049> of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
face come all the way around and sort of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.860 
face come all the way around and sort of
cover<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:10.670> design<00:03:11.060> how<00:03:11.510> am<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.630> going<00:03:11.780> to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
cover the design how am I going to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.590 
cover the design how am I going to
attach<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.030> will<00:03:14.090> be<00:03:14.390> done

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
attach it to this and that will be done

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.759 
attach it to this and that will be done
I<00:03:15.160> have<00:03:16.160> on<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.459> very<00:03:16.850> back<00:03:17.090> here<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.810> little

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
I have on the very back here a little

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.560 
I have on the very back here a little
pushpin<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.549> I'm<00:03:19.790> going<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.060> take<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.299> piece<00:03:20.540> of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
pushpin and I'm going to take a piece of

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.949 
pushpin and I'm going to take a piece of
wire<00:03:21.459> tie<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:23.030> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
wire tie it to the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.380 
wire tie it to the
and<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.170> will<00:03:26.380> cover<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.860> face<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.030> here<00:03:28.239> we

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
and that will cover the face so here we

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.750 
and that will cover the face so here we
have<00:03:28.540> our<00:03:28.660> overlay<00:03:29.200> gun<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:30.160> one<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.580> most

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
have our overlay gun and one of the most

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.630 
have our overlay gun and one of the most
important<00:03:31.450> things<00:03:31.660> with<00:03:32.230> this<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:35.610> do<00:03:36.610> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
important things with this is to do a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.030 
important things with this is to do a
little<00:03:37.000> bit<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.360> judicious<00:03:38.020> pruning<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.739> as<00:03:38.890> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
little bit of judicious pruning so as I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.030 
little bit of judicious pruning so as I
look<00:03:39.280> at<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:40.030> see<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:41.080> some<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
look at this I see that some of the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.530 
look at this I see that some of the
leaves<00:03:42.360> are<00:03:43.360> more<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.400> way<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.239> really

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
leaves are more in the way and really

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.630 
leaves are more in the way and really
this<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.019> about<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.500> vine<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.250> not<00:03:48.430> the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
this is about the vine and not the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.720 
this is about the vine and not the
leaves<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:49.989> trimming<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.830> trimming<00:03:51.489> and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
leaves so just trimming and trimming and

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.680 
leaves so just trimming and trimming and
trimming<00:03:52.319> until<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.709> your<00:03:53.890> vine<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:55.540> be

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
trimming until you get your vine to be

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:04.799 
trimming until you get your vine to be
mostly<00:03:56.140> fine<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:01.090> here<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.600> have<00:04:01.810> nature
