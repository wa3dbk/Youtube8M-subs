00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.949
 free calls 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 specifically they will have to do them with 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 what is the wifi if it is not going to generate 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.940
 extra costs in good 3g we are going to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.440
 try it as I tell you can generate 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.629
 conversations from balloons I think that 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.160
 many already know it but what now 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.309
 are implementing is the call 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.510
 free and good let's try this 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 free call 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.710
 let's generate a call with some 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.710
 of our contacts 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.190
 what we have here 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.810
 let's call him the other contact should 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 have the application installed 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.450
 To make it work 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.690
 on any device either the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.130
 Facebook or facebook application 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.650
 but if they do not have facebook 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.270
 Messenger will not be able to mark us but 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.250
 if we are going to be able to mark them 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.369
 they that is the data that I wanted them 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 happen since if you have any 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 familiar as we give on the other side of the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.270
 puddle will be able to communicate with 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 they do not answer us here we go to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.070
 try with our contact to see if 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.789
 they answer us here it may not work 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.789

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.789

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.040
 establishing the call 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.840
 there they are contacting 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.909
 there was an error of the call but good 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.480
 as you can see if they could have 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:25.299
 this calls here and they are totally 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.360
 free and equally with this 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.900
