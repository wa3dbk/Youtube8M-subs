00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.690
 now on a training the we fall 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.780
 true purse are actually the talents 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.090
 second and fourth national 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.650
 such as referees as an assistant 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.030
 we spend an hour once a month 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.040
 together in too wide for one 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.320
 national training and they become of 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.230
 closer and closer and they followed 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.490
 finally got the opportunity to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.390
 to work a bit in the picture here 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.520
 and what day to go do more experience 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.930
 am jan bos how i get i am 27 years old 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.820
 am from Ostend 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.340
 I currently find and the and third 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 national i was a soccer player stupid and 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 dom 15 years 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.339
 then cartilage injury the doctor had said 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.230
 then either you have to come off to one 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.839
 lower level that the tax for the the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 also end less or you need another 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.829
 hobby concerns I chose then in 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.429
 the football world and the 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.289
 and the arbitration track to come guys 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.540
 train almost two hours 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.689
 so a whole penalty training and physics 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.880
 shift her a lot of high intensity 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.159
 exercises and so they said you do not 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.600
 endurance runs but they really go 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.610
 acceleration as in the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.899
 contest 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.780
 the importance of the technical session 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.770
 that they actually need certain phases 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.649
 to estimate 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.590
 while being very relaxed to a phase 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.659
 can look and you at contour 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.429
 each mother they were woven deeply as 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.069
 against yesterday to do 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.350
 look at the feet did not look where the 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.149
 serving falls what was the good problem 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.549
 you watch often 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.270
 in which the muscles does not fall 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.789
 interest 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.459
 now problem is insite and outsite the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.409
 chances that we got here is just that 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.049
 Some see work tomorrow 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.780
 people with the training 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.580
 help the professor with your audience 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.580
 only that is unique I think 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.500
 call you a denderbelle is now my 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.460
 it's clear what I couldn't do before 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.470
 I am new with last year 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.479
 promoted a third so it is already now 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.700
 my first full season that you have one 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.560
 third whistle control the van 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.940
 terrain edit always on arrival 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.520
 it inside if she can be business that doesn't 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.989
 be fine as the still goes in it 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.130
 purpose or the only ones 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.510
 that growth drew people from the king 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.140
 florian turned out to be able to do so in time 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.140
 say to the cups 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.280
 I always have this warming up for a moment 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.050
 happiness sometimes that something 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.430
 as important apart from themselves 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.140
 separate those costs for those again 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.170
 warming the team in one go 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.750
 observe the spiders 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.940
 once on the r11 it did end up right away 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.940
 and you can let everything go 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.360
 of of of many cards and in advance 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.160
 to draw cards and tomorrow morning 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.450
 is necessary 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.490
 will also be wonderfully strict hair element 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.490
 honors what is possible and what is not possible 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 formed the first card I could not do otherwise 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.860
 then entered our liver ball box 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.440
 we will come again protests should i 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.150
 pull the next cart because also care 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.200
 Bart was able to be in those 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.980
 move this I actually stuff it 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.840
 continuously take a photo of the same 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.670
 player takes a photo first time 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.900
 in fits here should not say then if the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.490
 gives a verbal comment 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.020
 the next step is actually the yellow one 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.200
 cards that show me consistently shown 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.200
 to become 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.650
 watch the lessons is always 0 0 that sets it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.970
 at the end are not many opportunities to do 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.820
 but 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.380
 referees team is concentrated 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.110
 as are the most difficult moments 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.700
 concentration and an easy one 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.830
 competition or a simple competition 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.330
 simple building was the most difficult 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.860
 what is there for the referee so now 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.890
 is concentration 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.180
 important with the problem sometimes this 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.340
 so match me 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.450
 try to estimate these things 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.590
 ball goes to a goalkeeper then 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.360
 do you expect something completely from a gabber 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.430
 to the to the defender 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.840
 yes and then a little bit of anticipation 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.100
 had that ball go wide to go as the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.090
 keeper then does the wrong check 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.090
 then you still have to go deeper 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.510
 sometimes i think sometimes if you have a chance 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.220
 sees your player and chances 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.970
 chances to make me think of arbitrators or 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.970
 kind of done like that 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.919
 my ambitions as high as possible 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.020
 but that that mill was going to share 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.240
 and second national currently one 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.100
 days national so I hope someday 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.780
 pint to get nationally and in sittard 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.400
 am probably my ambition 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.300
 first national but I know 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.300
 not that it is impossible 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.919
 what i thought of jan van on training tom 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 tiguan from someone who has max control 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.210
 who is close to the game and who is physical 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.340
 then good matches is in order 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.479
 feel yourself as well as after the game 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.070
 to get the players to you and 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.150
 trainers 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.310
 was everyone coming to you and saying 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.720
 of a good match as well as it yourself 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.280
 feeling of having done the right game 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.810
 then you really have a very good feeling 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.449
 entered the dressing room 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.430
 each they contact assistants and 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.430
 this is an intense experience 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.540
 can world do you have then is sure 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.810
 between no roadtrain also here in one 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.440
 by the rapid counterattack and it is 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.440
 just fine 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.120
 for care and rest 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.340
 I think his wish is to take a step 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.139
 to put it higher it's up to him moment 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.270
 at every competition to my colleagues and 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.280
 to show me that it is worth 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.699
 and if she is true then they will 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.360
 to get 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.360
 music
