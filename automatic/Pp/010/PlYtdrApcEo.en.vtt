00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:18.933
Bengi : (Laugh) Don't need to ban jungle now.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.666

Impact : Huh? They banned Kassadian.

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:50.211
Impact : Then, Twitch and LeBlanc will be available, and I guess we will
        "eat" Twitch. What don't you want to give it away?

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:52.862

PoohManDu : It's 30seconds.

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.497

00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:21.989
Faker : It's not possible right now. He is being cautious right now.
        We can't catch him if he is being cautious.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.591

           then Twitch is better than Caitlyn in the team fight.
