00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
remember correctly i'm pretty certain on

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.300 
remember correctly i'm pretty certain on
this<00:00:29.210> i<00:00:29.420> originally<00:00:30.050> was<00:00:30.350> going<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.530> get<00:00:30.620> a<00:00:30.650> 900

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310

this i originally was going to get a 900
a<00:00:31.430> che<00:00:32.649> this<00:00:33.649> isn't<00:00:33.949> what<00:00:34.070> i<00:00:34.100> decided<00:00:34.519> on<00:00:34.760> i

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
a che this isn't what i decided on i

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.829 
a che this isn't what i decided on i
ended<00:00:35.449> up<00:00:35.539> getting<00:00:35.859> the<00:00:37.359> thing<00:00:38.359> somewhere

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839
