00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.340
 within our renderings made with moral for 3d studio max 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.070
 we can see several times to see annoying serrations for 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.530
 with regards to objects particularly colors or keys of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.609
 surfaces included 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.980
 to remedy this type of defect care and within it a control of the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.359
 always and therefore remedy of the algorithm connected to it in order to be able to camp 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 center the image created with the open the ring 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.199
 we are going to adjust this so-called final array of pixel weights with difficulty 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.080
 within the image 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 to be able to try to control this type of parameter it is sufficient to go 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.470
 to take the tutorial files to our practice 9 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.390
 imeil gestein pol. max 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.190
 you will find in this scene an infinite plan characterized by 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.540
 curved surfaces not even a wish they know that illuminates the scene 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.720
 right now if he loves me to create a small test render of this scene 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.870
 as well as 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.280
 we get such a result 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.970
 where to sell in the final we look for within the various objects 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.520
 annoying pixellated kings on the edges of all existing objects in the scene 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.050
 this returns housing a low quality perception of the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.170
 rendering was done in the best way 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.600
 to be able to overcome these problems we must not even position ourselves 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.290
 render render 78 f10 key from keyboard to open the setup window 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.550
 inherent in taking 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.230
 we position ourselves in the high blue ray and we look for the various submenus i 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.440
 better always 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.600
 right now I always get adopted as si x'd and then 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.660
 the antialiasing that is assigned this type of always in the image e 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.080
 totally absent 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.450
 let's try using the gmc tactic 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.320
 that is the antialiasing that is usually used in the scenes of 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.820
 medium quality 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.280
 the dmc web data is always better able to act on Sardinian minimum and maximum 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.760
 visciano 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.250
 minimonsta division minimum number of six impossible each pics 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.729
 were a value that exceeds 1 this to remedy the timing problems of 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.219
 calculation present in arrears ita 3d study max 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.439
 maximum balances search the maximum number of six impossible each pixel 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.109
 if we increase this parameter will also increase the 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.560
 number of minutes needed to calculate the final image 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:33.449
 dmc ymail data is often used for small details and 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.259
 bluray effects like those of montombraro existing inside a 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.829
 image 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.699
 much less memory is needed than the next process we're going to see 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.959
 that is to say the from fix design 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 the dmc tactic extremely useful for creating previews and then evaluating them 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.769
 the quality of the shadows of the lights existing inside the venda 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:03:01.279
 it creates a variable number of xan posted pics based on the difference 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.409
 of intensity between the pixellate neighboring ones 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.429
 let's try to render in order to understand better what exactly imit does 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.809
 always 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.939
 how can we stop already in these particular areas? 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:21.279
 sort of image eclipse you have free zones in which you go to improve 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.849
 the passage of the dark black pixel 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.849
 to the gray pixels of the object behind it 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.549
 we select from the image point of view we will notice that the 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.449
 quality of this image greatly improved compared to before 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.449
 when the doctors always was it was soffix med set then fixed on a 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.749
 parameter totally absent and free of anti-aliasing on the edges 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.739
 this kind of resolution we see can be further improved if 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.689
 let's activate the data xd let's say 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.650
 the one available in 3d studio max takes less than a saint paul 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.590
 for pics 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.569
 creating for a large pixel I hear the step can then go determine 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.569
 an even greater quality of our image 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.919
 let's check parameters minimun maximum write wait inside the 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.099
 submenu for setting the data xd viva 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.840
 the first minulet it if mail - 1 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:23.359
 create unp hear the minimum for 2 and p xd image 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.960
 while instead maximum write essentially creates if positioned on the 2 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.680
 8 simple for each pixel existing in the image 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:39.099
 this means that if we greatly increase hermes simon wright we go 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.839
 to increase the number of sean paul for pix n existing in the calculation 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.990
 of the image itself 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.669
 attention therefore not to place nudes and toso values ​​of 10 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.850
 since in that case you would get number d 2 at the eleventh you are a place for 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.930
 each pixel calculated within the image 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.560
 as you can well understand c3 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.560
 we have a big problem for calculating our time 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:09.839
 the - maize parameter it empires if active it allows to be able to distribute 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.729
 randomici always os calculated to be able to create a better antialiasing 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.979
 within the areas particularly close hills 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.309
 like this area where we lost count the pin is present in the 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.949
 band 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.900
 pochette outline instead over sample the edges of objects and this aspect if 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.919
 selected is not visible if we use particularities 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.699
 the interior of physics room as said freedom of summer 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.270
 so I recommend not using it within these two aspects if 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.779
 we have a physics room 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.659
 we can also use laces to resolve in order to calculate the 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.809
 sensitivity of the six is ​​important or when it changes to the intensity of the px 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:58.050
 this means that he thinks he imposes there are mum full name the intensity of pxl 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.740
 within the image 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.370
 if we assign a value greater than zero, 1 this can create times 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.740
 short is more under always that is to say - sampling of always ingres 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.669
 within our image 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.289
 and therefore - resolution from the point of view of the final image 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.599
 as far as this is concerned, this rule solves us 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:27.050
 if selected low then to sample yourself further under sampling 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.830
 of the areas with the normals that can have dim changes 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.819
 within the image 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.590
 obviously the more you increase this value the more rendering time it will go to 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:37.969
 to increase 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.930
 for now, therefore, let us be compliant with the law 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.750
 we are going to render the last possible instead always existing 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.969
 inside ur eyes 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.219
 as you can see the quality of this image is noticeably 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:56.339
 improved at points where appropriate center corn was applied x 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:57.619
 division 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:07:01.549
 and then you create additional areas of pixels that allow a 

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:06.110
 as soft as possible from the darkest area has the lightest area 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.499
 existing within this image 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:13.389
 obviously the times are slightly higher as far as production is concerned 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.089
 in person in the ring 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:18.909
 but the quality we can get extremely high, especially if 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:22.419
 we are going to raise the mac simon wright to the value of 4 or 5 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.979
 if in fact they once again give up and try to go and see 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:30.069
 this image thus created 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:35.479
 we will note that the yield of these nuances is greatly increased thanks to the 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.460
 subsampling of those that are the various existing pixell within 

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.229
 this area 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.910
 this means having higher quality but increased rendering time 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.599
 of a few seconds 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:53.439
 in fact, if it took 14 seconds before we die xd 2 in this case 

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:56.589
 increasing to 4 strokes a4 avant 

00:07:56.589 --> 00:08:02.029
 the time has almost doubled because it is 25 seconds necessary for 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:04.330
 being able to create the image we see here
