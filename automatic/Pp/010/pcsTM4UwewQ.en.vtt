00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and all they do is secondary so that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
and all they do is secondary so that
makes<00:01:26.850> me<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.210> frustrated<00:01:27.450> sometimes<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
there's not much I can do about that and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
there's not much I can do about that and
there's<00:01:32.640> another<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:33.210> i'm<00:01:34.079> using<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
there's another thing i'm using the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.539 
there's another thing i'm using the
striker<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> guys

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
striker so I don't know what do you guys

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.530 
striker so I don't know what do you guys
think<00:01:35.610> about<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> striker<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.360> think

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
think about the striker do you think

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.819 
think about the striker do you think
it's<00:01:36.630> overpowered<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.439> once<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> get

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's overpowered I think once you get

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's overpowered I think once you get
all<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> perks<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:38.970> really

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
all the perks for it's a really really

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.999 
all the perks for it's a really really
good<00:01:39.600> gun<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.409> me<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:40.920> it's

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
good gun for me I don't think it's

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
good gun for me I don't think it's
overpowered<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.640> i<00:01:41.729> personally<00:01:42.090> don't

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
overpowered because i personally don't

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
overpowered because i personally don't
get<00:01:42.720> killed<00:01:42.960> by<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> often<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.850> see

them from afar I grenade them flash than

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
them from afar I grenade them flash than
whatever<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.880> deal<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> can

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
whatever I can deal with it I can

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.170 
whatever I can deal with it I can
counter<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:54.000> someone

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
counter it but like when I see someone

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
counter it but like when I see someone
that<00:01:54.270> I'd<00:01:54.540> 95<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> camping<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> back

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that I'd 95 and the camping in the back

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
that I'd 95 and the camping in the back
of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> map<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.729> prone<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.540> that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
of the map just prone like that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
of the map just prone like that's
pathetic<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.740> can't<00:01:59.040> kill<00:01:59.280> him<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.610> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pathetic and I can't kill him like I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
pathetic and I can't kill him like I
just<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.079> run<00:02:01.350> away<00:02:01.439> from<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> situation

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
just have to run away from the situation

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
just have to run away from the situation
because<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.490> can't<00:02:02.729> face<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.390> some

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
because I can't face them with some

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.980 
because I can't face them with some
machine<00:02:04.229> gun<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.240> shotgun<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.689> it's

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
machine gun or a shotgun it's just it's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
machine gun or a shotgun it's just it's
you<00:02:07.170> can't<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.000> my

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you can't do it but that's just my

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.999 
you can't do it but that's just my
little<00:02:09.330> thought<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.530> overpowered

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
little thought on it that overpowered

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.380 
little thought on it that overpowered
guns<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.970> most<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.750> time

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
guns that you can most of the time

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.840 
guns that you can most of the time
them<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:15.010> about<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.310> player<00:02:15.550> like

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
them and it's more about the player like

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.309 
them and it's more about the player like
the<00:02:15.970> gun<00:02:16.120> might<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.540> good<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:16.780> you're<00:02:17.050> playing

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
the gun might be good if you're playing

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.620 
the gun might be good if you're playing
against<00:02:17.650> someone<00:02:17.709> who's<00:02:18.040> really<00:02:18.100> good

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
against someone who's really good

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.090 
against someone who's really good
obviously<00:02:19.630> it's<00:02:20.260> gonna<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> little<00:02:20.680> unfair

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
obviously it's gonna be a little unfair

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.130 
obviously it's gonna be a little unfair
especially<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.850> if<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.240> looked<00:02:22.420> at<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> MLG

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
especially like if you looked at the MLG

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.710 
especially like if you looked at the MLG
or<00:02:23.640> game<00:02:24.640> battle<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.060> rule<00:02:25.209> solution<00:02:25.480> or<00:02:25.569> type

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
or game battle to rule solution or type

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.980 
or game battle to rule solution or type
95<00:02:25.930> allowed<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.209> maybe<00:02:28.209> because<00:02:28.510> everyone<00:02:28.870> was

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
95 allowed so maybe because everyone was

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.300 
95 allowed so maybe because everyone was
using<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.740> think<00:02:29.950> it'd<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> different

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
using it it I think it'd be a different

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.640 
using it it I think it'd be a different
game<00:02:30.670> but<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.080> more<00:02:32.110> thing<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.440> say
