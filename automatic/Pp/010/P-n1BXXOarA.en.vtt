00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 Gerd Reuter and his team hold 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.790
 look for a red kite can barely 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 are the bird friends in hopes 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.020
 Already the bird man appears on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.640
 sky to see to the right 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.890
 stefan rhein watches the griffin birds 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 in the eifel for 15 years 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.990
 after the red kite almost died out 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 he has been back since the 80s 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.440
 back is anton extratouren since 2007 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 The number has increased and since then 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.899
 year 2000 we keep the numbers 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.110
 initially there were 30 40 couples 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.730
 There are already 80 pairs each year 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.140
 year we go through a week 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.329
 the area and register the oil level 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.530
 long after engage in there 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.760
 great views 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 red kites like to keep close 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 from villages to where they feed enough 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 find them on mown fields hunt them 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.900
 they sometimes nest with mice and insects 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 next to houses 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.700
 so sonja lampertz has her own 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.090
 passion for rotmilane discovers the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.409
 she watched since her childhood 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 Silkenberg supports her work 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.330
 the ornithologist honorary of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.060
 I can do our house every day 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.299
 watching red kites and if something 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.600
 special to see and share 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.280
 then I share that with my 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.430
 calls and I try the population 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 also to be inspired by the red kite 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:49.500
 Everyone knows that I am actively involved and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.460
 I'm excited about the red kite and stuff 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.680
 I also sensitize the population 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.290
 for the red kite why the red kite 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.240
 feels so at home in eastern Belgium that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
 should clarify a new investigation 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 the avis east canton and its partners 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.460
 with the support of the Walloon 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.640
 region 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.610
 At the end of may, four red kites came along for this 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.860
 solar powered GPS transmitter 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.110
 equipped for a year on the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.200
 back of the migratory birds remain attached 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.080
 every 15 minutes the device registers 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 the position of the animal 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.800
 The data will be in regular 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.900
 distances by means of an antenna and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.360
 a base station on a portable 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.820
 computer loaded and then evaluated 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.760
 explains gerhard reuther from avis ost 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.370
 Cantonese to maintain the position that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.800
 blaspheme concrete conclusions to where 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.840
 are the preferences where the missing 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.660
 redmilan well which areas 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.180
 he avoids where he sleeps for example 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.910
 These are also very important 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.830
 important also the danger potential through 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.590
 wind turbines should be with the gps 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.690
 the data will be found out to senders 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.550
 document where and how close the birds are 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.459
 approach the wind wheels 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.160
 The project also includes farmers 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.470
 interview her activities are recorded 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.180
 and with the data of the red kite 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.730
 compared and evaluated 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.010
 not just climate and geographic 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.530
 also agriculture can become 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.370
 favorable to the population of red kites 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.170
 affect 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.040
 we can still really argue here 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.950
 that there is a smaller one here 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.290
 medium-sized agriculture gives when 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.110
 they are not very extensive either 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.540
 managed very close to nature 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.580
 works and that is something of which 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.650
 picked land very strong profits though 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.470
 Let's take a look over the East Belgian 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.290
 landscape we throw it out 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.220
 are so mosaic shaped smaller 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.100
 structures with valuable elements 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.299
 Meadows meadows pastures 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.810
 searches of hedges and rows of trees 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.080
 and all this entire mosaic gives that 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.900
 red kite from that good living conditions 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.570
 fruit these conditions are not just 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.890
 for the red kite find worth preserving 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:09.110
 the ornithologists think 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.900
 here you have to be aware that that 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.060
 quite unique is the Eastern Cantons 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.519
 are really something special that is 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.220
 something to be proud of and with 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.290
 one should handle nature carefully and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.450
 Agriculture 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.020
 can work together this is one 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.110
 concept for the future and you 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.110
 coming
