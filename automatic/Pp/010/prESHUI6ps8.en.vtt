00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.560
 1 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.390
 yeah 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.640
 we are here at the terminal of our for the 60th 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.489
 departmental final of plowing therefore 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 organized like every year by the gia 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.620
 of Lower Rhine and this year by Canton 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.970
 of brumath so the final of the purse 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.160
 is an event that takes place every year 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.629
 and every year another canton that 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.129
 co-organizes the event has that the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.629
 department is so this year it is 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.309
 really at the gates of strasbourg at the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.050
 wantzenau with young people from the canton of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.949
 brumath who have who prepared this 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 event and who welcome us 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.070
 today 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 there is a plow category planks 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.560
 a flat plow category and a 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.259
 category farm plows category 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.719
 hoe planks they have to plow so 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.009
 a rectangle that is 100 meters long 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.100
 over 20 meters wide 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.140
 it's plows that are plows 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.600
 who do not have seals 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.200
 above they must respect a 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.130
 speed to finish these normally 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.569
 half past two boards must 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.780
 that they make right furrows 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:57.470
 rectilinear the same height as all 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 the stubble are fleeing the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.750
 category flat is the plows 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.599
 reversible so they have a trapeze to 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.849
 plowing that's 12 out of 22 years that a 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.099
 side 12 and 20 pm and it is necessary that they 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.650
 close to the centimeter it's not 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.980
 obvious since we must not leave 10 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.660
 cm ni 5 and you have to plow and 20 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.970
 centimeters you have to finish at 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.260
 centimeter is surely the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.060
 category which is the most difficult for 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 do a good job of plowing since they have a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.440
 trapeze they must close all 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.130
 holes the depth is set at 18 cm 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.930
 so plowing flat and it has to be that the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.630
 straightness is also the most important 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.950
 same as the board today at the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.440
 first two who will be selected 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.019
 so the first and the second in 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.609
 board will be selected is the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.170
 first and second flat will be 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.120
 selected for the regional that will have 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.690
 place in the meurthe and moselle the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.690
 next weekend 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.500
 thanks to these competitions there are thousands 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.420
 of people there who we were 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.980
 already there at noon but the thousands of 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.019
 people passing by and watching 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.480
 these contests and it's rewarding 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.519
 all these young people but also for all 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.349
 people who spend the love of the land 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.120
 it is the most beautiful because 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.739
 that we often forget what we have 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.980
 in our plates is going through the earth 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.540
 and I think it's the wealth of 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.139
 the whole department but the whole end of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.139
 the whole of France 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.990
 thank you 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.220
