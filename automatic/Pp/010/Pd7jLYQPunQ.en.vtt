00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 good morning friends youtube writers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 today we are going to give you a small day of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.309
 Android challenge jailbreak versus android 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.630
 that you remember that two years ago 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.710
 weeks I posted a video 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.969
 I recommend you see in this video if 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.040
 you have no idea what I am 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.410
 speaking this is an update so that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 know what we are in what we are 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.109
 working so we go with the logo and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.109
 let's start with the video 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.310
 hey guys on Monday the letter was sent to 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.050
 the youtubers that you chose to 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.460
 something I want to tell you about that I 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.470
 I'm going to tell you the name of each of 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.329
 those that I chose but is that the way 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.760
 that I said to choose the youtubers 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.769
 or not necessarily youtubers but I 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.900
 I said mention who you want to see 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.080
 here below mention to whom you 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.089
 want to see in the challenge and me and us 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.809
 let's communicate with all of them 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.940
 we did that I sent him a message 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.949
 to all that I saw there mentioned 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.470
 many have not answered others yes 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.170
 they responded but there are also others that 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.000
 are not youtubers that work with the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.850
 jailbreak make ribiaux to devices 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.130
 android but not exactly work 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.470
 with it boils that is for example the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.390
 Android guys for an excellent channel 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.640
 in win that makes very nice review very 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.140
 good about android but I 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.930
 I communicated with him on twitter and I 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.420
 They said that they just are not so 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.360
 experts like that in the world of rut and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.240
 remember guys this is a challenge 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.190
 jailbreak versus root is not ios versus 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.930
 android because here we are going to see them 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.320
 how much can be prepared 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.700
 phone with these two methods and I do that 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.020
 I explained it in the previous video so 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.550
 I recommend you go see this 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.560
 video I'm going to leave it here under another 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.840
 of the complaints that I saw is that it was said to 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.280
 that are only youtubers not only 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.260
 are youtubers are you 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.660
 mention here below then if I what 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.670
 I did everything individually 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.680
 the subscribers to all those who 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.990
 they commented here they were going to comment 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.760
 same as for example I am going to say or 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.410
 I want to participate and you are not going to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.260
 mention another youtuber understand me 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.990
 it's like it's not so much because to him 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.910
 has many followers not no no 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.590
 it depends that so many people voted for you 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.660
 down here so I sent him the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.009
 invitation to android but let's see 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.800
 if I have it all here in the mind 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.050
 android pro review 3 know who has already 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.150
 participated with us in several 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.030
 podcast I'm putting it on screen 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.330
 we have your techno world also that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.730
 will be one of those on the android side 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.069
 I think if I'm not wrong and we also have 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.739
 to your practices, I will leave you 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.450
 youtube the channels here below in case 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.280
 that you want to see if you 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.079
 they want here they can also say but 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.999
 The best thing you can do is go 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.689
 where are youtuber that you want 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:44.579
 see him and tell him about this challenge because 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.290
 with the mention has not been enough 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.750
 although if supra pixel was communicated 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.209
 with me and told me of the side up or 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.730
 We will be supporting Fernando five 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.709
 one in check and I also had 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.419
 enough mentions to fernando that makes 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.879
 an excellent job also with the 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.609
 jailbreak and we're already talking to 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.069
 get together this Sunday guys like 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.949
 I told them it's not going to be live but everything 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.349
 it will be recorded and everything will be edited by me 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.810
 after the event we can do something in 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.400
 I live but after the event after 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.310
 let the video be made with the demonstration 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.980
 because I do not want the video to be something 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.290
 so without order but something well ordered 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.409
 event will be recorded we are talking about the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.329
 March 30th although there are 6 youtubers 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.400
 something can change and I 'm going to 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.500
 keep informed if you see another 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.900
 opde and if they do not see another job day it's because 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.480
 We're underway 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.340
 will be recorded on March 30 , we will 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.709
 be each one for great the call 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.220
 it leaves is no longer going to be recorded and 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.379
 we will also be recording each one 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.290
 with your camera to show clear what 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.359
 to be said because we are going to do it I 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.909
 I also explained in the previous video you 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.530
 you tell me something I tell you something and there I 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.750
 I show it what I say I show it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 on my phone what can be done and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.829
 that's going to be a point for the side 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.409
 opposite or one point less and so 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.690
 successively it will not be something of the 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.310
 importance or we can not say good 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.409
 This is more important than no no no 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.770
 so many you can do so many I 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.020
 I can make me understand that part there 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.790
 because we can not say let's say that or 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.980
 look I can do this this is more 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.740
 important this is worth x 3 no no no because 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.060
 the importance is given 1 if we can not 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.370
 give importance we will measure the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.170
 amount of things that each of 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.210
 the devices can do 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.380
 remember guys that the event is a 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.480
 jailbreak challenge versus root not ios 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.990
 versus android I already mentioned it and it's a 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.940
 event mainly to learn me 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.070
 it interests a lot of heart just say me 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.390
 It is very interesting to learn how much 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.270
 can do I was talking to 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.640
 emilio par and one who is a frustrated 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.870
 android rangers but he will be 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.340
 watching this video and then going to 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.810
 complain and I told him something that the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.370
 iphone could be my son gua not 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.990
 I knew I could do that you have 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.030
 then I myself is what I 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.040
 I want to achieve he is an expert in 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.720
 android but I did not know the iphone 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.270
 could do that so that same thing what 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.900
 I want to get both experts from 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.780
 each side learn and I know that if I 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.490
 I have a lot of faith in this project I know that 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.250
 it's going to be something nice we can make a 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.050
 very very good job and to finish already 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.550
 what is the definition of 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.560
 personalization 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.350
 I know that a previous shipment I gave the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.110
 example of changing a typeface 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.730
 change an icon but it's not only 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.950
 change the design of something but the 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.220
 functions that you can do for 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.800
 example col bqr that is a tweet that I 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.390
 allows me to make calls felt 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.670
 to enter the application of the 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.500
 calls that's some personalization 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.720
 because I'm customizing the way 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.610
 I make calls understand me not 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.890
 only customization we're going to 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.780
 limit to change the design because that 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.850
 it's the simplest thing this is what all the 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.730
 world can do not also the 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.830
 customization is included or unnamed 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.600
 or if it was not understood well I ask 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.910
 apologies and I'm explaining it now 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.730
 but in the customization also if you 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.830
 they include the functions that I can 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.660
 customize the functions that I already 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.570
 I have on the iphone to customize 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.850
 so they work differently ok and they 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.400
 I said those who are going to be let's leave 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.080
 here below we are going to leave the youtubers 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.580
 who are going to participate and you too 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.340
 You can mention other youtubers that 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.280
 you want to see although I no longer think that 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.250
 we will change the date so yes 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.930
 good this video today is Thursday so 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.040
 if from Thursday to Sunday we do not get 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.410
 another youtuber 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.000
 another person that they are and send me this 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.889
 video and say and talk to Martian and 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.810
 that they make me a tag by twitter a 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.880
 tag by twitter and so we can 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.770
 talk and we can coordinate that with others 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.090
 youtubers that you want to see but 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.410
 So far these are the youtubers that 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.330
 we have and I believe that with these 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.760
 youtubers we can do a very but very 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.740
 good job I'm also trying to 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.630
 get a referee someone who is not 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.030
 neither one side nor another to do it 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.440
 more interesting but nothing if not 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.419
 find we're going to go like this guys 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.580
 until he's going to leave us guys this was 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.200
 only one short one short 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.300
 update I always say that my 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.400
 children are corts and I go long but 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.990
 it's normal, so if the video 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.050
 liked do not forget to give it a little hand up 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.880
 and say here below who else 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.740
 that you want to see in these 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.930
 remember that it is you who 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.300
 decide who will be in this 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.820
 I find the video you have to 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.560
 wait for a third update where I'm going 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.960
 to say what day the video will come out or 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.820
 it depends on how long the video and what 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.710
 so much I have to do to make the 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.270
 to finish the video ok but I do not know 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.630
 despair I know they are leaving you 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.000
 comment 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.560
 everywhere but do not despair 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.090
 that once the video is done I have 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.160
 to start editing I'm going to do 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.960
 as quickly as possible to have it to 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160
 time but maybe you can think that 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.550
 You must wait for a third 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.990
 update or just wait for the 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.320
 video this certain problems are no longer 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.320
 be like that
