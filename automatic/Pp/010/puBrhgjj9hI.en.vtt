00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
one but did not want the loops you could

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.430 
one but did not want the loops you could
do<00:01:49.509> every<00:01:49.930> every<00:01:50.710> chord<00:01:51.310> between<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.000> two

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
everything through this last loop I'll

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.660 
everything through this last loop I'll
just<00:03:30.220> continue<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:31.030> pull

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.979 

this<00:03:36.670> will<00:03:36.909> be<00:03:37.090> just<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.480> at<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.810> beginning

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
this will be just like at the beginning

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.800

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
where I left three cocoons there I pull

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.390 
where I left three cocoons there I pull
it<00:03:43.989> tight<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.459> now<00:03:45.670> it's<00:03:46.000> knotted<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:47.400> this

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
it tight so now it's knotted and this

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.059
