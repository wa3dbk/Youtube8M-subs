00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.059
 hello hello so we are 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.520
 today 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.539
 Huawei product line with an example 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.180
 the huawei vision 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.590
 so this is an android smartphone that 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.230
 shows all the innovations of huawei 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.470
 as well in terms of design with a 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.280
 metal design with integration 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.839
 quite specific to the sim card and 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.030
 the map of the microsd card for example 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.629
 we really have a very fine design and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.420
 quality we also have a job that has 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.519
 been done on the on the phone with the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.670
 an interface a job that was done 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.280
 with spb we have a 3d interface I 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.120
 proposed in this phone so it's a 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.589
 interface that can be found on 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.420
 the android market but she was 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.059
 customized by spb 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.729
 for me yes good to see here by 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.289
 example the logo wii also found 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.670
 some widgets like weather widgets 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.089
 which have been integrated directly into 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.340
 the phone 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.630
 the interest of this phone is to have 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.670
 something different in the market 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.979
 today we see phones that 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.970
 are black plastic squares of this 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.640
 we propose it's a phone 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.990
 rounded with an exclusive design and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.110
 that we easily recognize with 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 this little sphere behind and the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.100
 metallic design at the level of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.850
 specifications born with the last 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.220
 version of android 2.3 points 5 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.560
 we have a screen of 3.7 inches in hd but 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.200
 it is a slab signal very bright and 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.409
 that saves a lot of energy we have a 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.819
 Processor processor 1 gig of memory 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.830
 and so all the features 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.130
 main android ie the gps the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.689
 bluetooth connectivity 3g + 14 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.609
 points 4 which is very important for 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.619
 we since we have a better 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.950
 user experience 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.719
 in terms of speed and so here is so 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.870
 at the soft level we have an integration 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.050
 some games 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.260
 of origin with burt for example is so 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.310
 this 3d interface of spb we can see 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.310
 unfold
