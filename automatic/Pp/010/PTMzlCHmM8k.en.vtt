00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.740
 jo people welcome your race to weather 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.209
 a new mother or three video on this 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.770
 my channel look like gaming 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.560
 what of course we are going to try today 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.750
 is to drop him in this jar 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.029
 just use the one charming it can 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.230
 and he is naturally strong and strong 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.430
 almost everyone used to get into the game 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.199
 so then I'll just use it 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.640
 and let's see if it grew 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.770
 scoring can drop scrum why 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.270
 this pop art oath 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.830
 if I still know him well from my head and 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.720
 we see that it will or we will 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.760
 may be on it or not sometimes I get 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.190
 him and sometimes I don't get him and we see 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.020
 so naturally at the end of this game 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.280
 whether I have passed or not then just go 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.200
 we try to run a bit towards it 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.340
 just go try a little bit so hard 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.960
 possible to run for it because 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.700
 the faster the head runs the nicer I am 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.870
 of course is to watch so me 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.890
 go try it 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.079
 so far it is going pretty well 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.730
 well that red shit that Jon could still do 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.100
 lift and you also add to that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.750
 I have already come fresh snow earth 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.250
 there is a daman i would like him to have that vest 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.050
 on the search I actively and trend of 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.700
 by being so good that it ca n't be that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.289
 still run back but can the special 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.970
 7 what piece of art is what it is 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.050
 a start that is not quite a bad thing 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.280
 well here right away 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.690
 So it just may continue to sit 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.310
 run so fast and specialist 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.780
 make it will be fine anyway 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.399
 the game I think the gates 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.200
 argue threw emmy's ocean box 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.970
 contimeta size fungi job 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.619
 goedzo boy do you ever go well 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.330
 so there is another child on the trip 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.399
 walk 3 upstairs with teamie above you 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.630
 bouvy above your foot would be boys and 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.590
 had them all strapped to the safe 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.599
 of course what that flag they just have 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.250
 caught and that is now a standard span 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:35.590
 they waited for them here at three here 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.770
 beside me oh yeah what the fuck how did i know 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.550
 he had johannes that i was standing there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.050
 Of course you already knew I was there 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.700
 seen it all but it went 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.770
 really like the idea that I didn't know that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.119
 He knew I was standing there by the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.649
 run towards it which is not so handy 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.179
 method is if that guy is know you 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.330
 it says and 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.130
 oh my god oh my god boys self man and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.569
 was our real retards normally 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.729
 i need to make sure i just 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.440
 chill in it can run man eat dawson 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.929
 market just didn't want to get but the and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.700
 music the attack and they like that flag 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.869
 not have a moment because we are going well 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.940
 well beast iroh and then we must go on 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.259
 keep putting on and it goes well with that 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.759
 triple cap so as long as your trip i have 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.040
 keeps going well and stays well 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.540
 I think pressure will all best needs 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.099
 never have your own in domination all 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 strip I have good goes and goes days 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.150
 by just nice and handy with it 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.530
 I never actually what triple caps are 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.180
 own irritants what you can get 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.620
 but sometimes 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.569
 and I also really mean myself whole 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.040
 sometimes such a triple cap goes well 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.379
 then you see them tense just fx on the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.489
 good moments at the good spawn in you 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.349
 message and then you can delicious 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.939
 delicious killer and again killer 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.310
 you see the spaniel of all shapes 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.750
 of a moment I think I still have 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.730
 just warm special again there is another one 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.019
 sniper there well so team just eat it 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.609
 again almost miss special as you can 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.230
 see if December is that chilly and up against 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.609
 I have him again people chose you this 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.530
 I mean the strip cap can sometimes be good 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.480
 go into this such a day when it is 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.030
 suddenly goes well and has c that is 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.439
 good because we can now so that in 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.540
 start running because otherwise the spawn will flip 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.250
 Coming up and then are just not good 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.870
 it dies or not quite right 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.780
 that is very good often good in a cinema 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.260
 the no matter that 's good joke wrong 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 that catch one 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.939
 holy shit i know how i got that fat killer 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.280
 size does not interest me you just have to 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.049
 the thick thick multico mystics for so 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.180
 pretty well I got from that guy and wait them 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.590
 just for a moment because sit here behind me and 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.419
 she is sitting here so you can't do well 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.120
 He expected the whole approach 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.829
 the one thinking is now dead and the knowing 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.650
 this guy is now often drock 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.269
 in behind me you are dead and me too 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.780
 I want you now I want you now I'm 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.680
 Does your I want to have you 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.479
 never actually do it like i do now 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.919
 just a tip to death is just for boys 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.720
 and if i do now because i just run now 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.280
 literally that tension I now imagine 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.780
 open and exposed to all that boring vision you 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.829
 sit on the back so you have to 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.629
 never actually do it but i do it now 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.459
 just what can the enemy be 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.530
 the best and the mass and as long as it is good 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.939
 you should also just try it 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.530
 because the chance is pretty chilly I'm going now 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.540
 just off randy sign means that our 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.109
 I also know how to see the wait 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.290
 there they are 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.849
 I hit them I got him dead and sitting 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.829
 there is another boss good yes column 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.479
 troll beautiful name of that guy who got 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.769
 i also die i need fast driver now 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.290
 as exciting in construction as well 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.419
 spawners day wait a moment wait a moment 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.709
 wait a moment split panda it 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.909
 I can do them immediately if you spawn that 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.769
 boys watch out 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.690
 extra did you run inside i 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.769
 knew the man sponge that you head and learn 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.500
 then you know immediately if they are tense 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.880
 and so if you like that guy that weekend 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.770
 there one and then you take the blast and 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.270
 if there is just not what happened to you and 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.270
 Herb people sit on the stairs here 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.740
 the stairs on the stairs I have the throat there 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.849
 for me another one there is once again well 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.180
 I have the throat 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.180
 behind us 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.270
 because also keep an eye on those stairs 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 both nice sweet and kind 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.000
 so of course you can also just take 4 the stairs 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.170
 come 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.700
 and now we are the lion and the 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.310
 coming again two side cathy on the stairs i 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.680
 she said, keeping an eye on things 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.180
 so also coming through just when I visited the site 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.720
 came in and I had the mole 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.160
 thank you and i have the mole people and 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.330
 is it i was just now it could 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
 study so that a little limp dicks 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.600
 but you see it is not a triple cap 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.010
 handy to do if the spawn cut it 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.080
 The moment I flipped a trip package 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.910
 app and it goes well that way 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.500
 between sponge that does not flip then the 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.600
 stay in the spawn all the time 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.160
 in a certain place then you can 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.440
 just keep that triple cap but it 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.700
 point is that is about one of the 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.250
 hardest things to do with one 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.660
 triple cap doesn't die because of that 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.200
 someone next to you spawn but it's me 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.540
 succeeded 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.710
 and yes I have the morals within groups 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.910
 just notice right away because I can do the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.170
 second time can no longer get what it 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.490
 potje goes on fast the week on 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.230
 which of course the trip I often have that 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.040
 whole pot he has delicious in the evening 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.540
 joke 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.100
 we are nicely slowed down and nobody 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.300
 still had a multi qmusic with the bouncy 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.060
 bed i in between 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.550
 Hoppetee people finally was pretty well 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.460
 look beautiful on you because the school sees 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.260
 they remained good but very often 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.460
 spanner also a person just fx on one 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.680
 another place and then you have to look carefully 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.330
 and find focusing and listening 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.830
 a sound and pay attention everywhere you go 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.090
 but you can pay attention and you can pay attention to forest tree 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.740
 was still killing 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.000
 and the point is like you on all things 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.830
 can pay attention if you can multitask 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.090
 then call of duty and normal play are for 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.650
 meet you watch your sound 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.240
 you have to be on your environment just you have to 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.800
 at the same time yuri four letter and top 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.080
 you just have to watch your teammates 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.360
 how they play how should there be nifv 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.400
 must also be able to respond and this is 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.870
 and just a multi-task 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.610
 actually spell what you should all do 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.780
 things at the same time the master ate 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.370
 and we get the hang of how you are 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.750
 all must do at the same time 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.980
 really play a very chill game 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.610
 And then you can also give them good scores 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.390

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.350
 In addition, you must of course 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.750

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.850

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.290
 times bass boom there you are one anyway 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.490
 very better player 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.200
 In addition, of course you have to 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.370
 just better is just a good one 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.040

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.170
 want to chill the targets and you 're there too 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.880
 can lift and only then flower then it goes 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.860

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.470
 inside i'm not sure yet all 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.760
 star beach 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.170
 I think that guy and also to get inside 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.460
 now exists one by one on the left 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.480
 from me left of the focus on myers 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.190
 I first turn the 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.380
 Switched these parties are lying 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.670

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.140
 tens of thousands is one here 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.510
 equally reloaded size do not convert okay me 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.890
 just help me sit down no way 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.510
 after the short sit anyway so I think 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.890
 so beautiful because once I finish 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.480
 I met the straight then I could straighten out 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.460
 not anymore because once on is normal 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.930
 the goal is such a game and then you 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.310
 then die ah fuck it you've got the 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.140

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.260
 the times die 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.520
 Shame on me not dying in it 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.700

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.960

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.130
 in which to return via 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.810
 the other side to come one mine 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.820

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.140

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.970
 don't have to grab a flag again and kiowa 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.070
 again I have kills 60 people 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.570
 61 teams hoist moment the game is over 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.760
 because there will now be 199 points 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.410
 and then exists in one go 3 2 1 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.850
 the 200 on the clock and then I can fine 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.970
 also quite grab a lot of tea and pass 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.590
 flower 6310 dropped it on you and moles 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.160
 whether three here was a game to play 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.570
 it was a plushpool because I ran 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.860
 just an exciting one and I stayed for a while 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.510
 more reserved and I again the other 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.010
 side remained on guard against retainer 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.720
 and sucked into the present by 

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.550
 and those are simply the easiest 

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.560
 appeals the mole frontal appeal or rescue 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.510
 and been a while retain it off 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.770
 run then just hold back there is 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.000
 testiness truth people scored 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.060
 well liked please give thank you 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.210
