00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
 Let's learn how we make a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 white sauce or that inside the kitchen 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.380
 We call it a professional sauce. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 chanel his secret is the following is the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 the proportion we will have to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.279
 butter and wheat flour then just to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 People look good you're going to use 80 grams 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.080
 of butter 80 grams of flour 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.740
 wheat to one liter of milk or make the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.199
 sauce 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 first of all linking our fire and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.780
 heating the pan 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.920
 I'll put the butter in the pan and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.469
 with ours was the wire whisk I 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.239
 I'll stir and I'll make the whole sauce. 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.989
 first I have to have this butter 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.090
 the almost- detained butter 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.090
 now I will add the wheat flour 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.260
 ae will mix she said she had seen 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.260
 a pussy for our little pussy 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.350
 I'll leave it to cook over medium heat 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.660
 for about 1 5 to 6 minutes when 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.940
 she starts to get whiter I go 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.850
 put milk all at once and stir 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.680
 very fast good 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 it came then in the texture that I 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.560
 I wanted this color more whitish and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.540
 now go back and move it as it was with the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.370
 my wire whisk and put all the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.519
 milk at once of stirring very fast 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.519
 [Music] 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 now stirred homogenized i'll tinker 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 he always slowly slows down for more 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.399
 or less about 20 minutes which is the time 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.220
 it will take time to thicken 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.740
 good already after 20 minutes the sauce already 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.899
 thickened you can see this 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 texture in it we know that it 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.170
 thickened it reached a point where the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.330
 people call the point in the pt that is the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.759
 that it fills the gap in the case of 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.850
 our spoon but it does not leave any 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.649
 vestige no no vacant point it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.390
 has a certain consistency but it is not 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.680
 Consistent mother is the time for us 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 seasoning and seasoning with the backyard and walnut 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 grated on the spot 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 It's always cool that we wear walnut 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.720
 freshly grated nutmeg because if it already 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
 she has a lot of perfume she has 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.300
 and we are wrong as the quantity 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:33.030
 that we are going to put this is one of the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.620
 base models of the kitchen then with 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.260
 This sauce, we 'll even do it. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.790
 various other molds for example the sauce 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.490
 four cheeses and it is thus makes a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.889
 white sauce 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.889
