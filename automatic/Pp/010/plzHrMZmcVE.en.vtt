each<00:00:31.710> other<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> noob<00:00:32.940> trusty<00:00:33.390> sidekick

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
each other are a noob trusty sidekick

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
each other are a noob trusty sidekick
and<00:00:34.020> we're<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.680> fire<00:00:35.160> at<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> exact

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and we're going to fire at the exact

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240 
and we're going to fire at the exact
same<00:00:36.270> time<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.559> clock<00:00:37.800> we're<00:00:38.129> not

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
same time on the time clock we're not

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.860 
same time on the time clock we're not
using<00:00:38.430> voice<00:00:38.730> commands<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.420> there's<00:00:39.629> lag

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
using voice commands because there's lag

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.060 
using voice commands because there's lag
and<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> voice<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> everything<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.010> that

so<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.210> shooting<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.719> each<00:00:42.750> other<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so we are shooting at each other at the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
so we are shooting at each other at the
exact<00:00:43.620> same<00:00:43.800> time<00:00:44.070> you're<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.149> that
