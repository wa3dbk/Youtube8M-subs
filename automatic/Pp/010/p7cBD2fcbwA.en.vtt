00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.790
 very good everyone believes more a new 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.519
 main video that will welcome 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.530
 episode number 4 of rediscovering 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.330
 minecraft in this series I tell you everything 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.160
 about things that were in minecraft 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.260
 and then they were eliminated although never 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.059
 they came to be implemented in this series 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.130
 You can see a detailed explanation of 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.710
 everything I show you in my review of 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.839
 misnamed called rediscovered a mod that 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.900
 recreates this kind of thing as well as 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.730
 many others that the mod does not add if you go 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.230
 to the review you can access the episode 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.849
 of rediscovering minecraft that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.599
 correspond with what I am teaching you 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.890
 there 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.530
 today I will talk about a block project 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.780
 thought of jet lag crying obsidian 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.250
 also known as bleeding obsidian 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.770
 whose translation into Spanish would be 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.440
 obsidian obsidian crybaby crying 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.930
 but it is also called atrocious obsidian and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.410
 bloody obsidian I overcame the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.750
 version of minecraft beta 1.3 in which 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.340
 He added its original texture never 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.650
 came to put the block but it did 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.329
 thought the texture as you see was a 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.040
 mixture of obsidian with lapis lazuli 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.960
 would probably be created with these two 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.940
 materials and would initially serve 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.250
 to save the spam point before the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.909
 beds is worth this function later and the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.280
 I would replace 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.960
 hamas in rediscovered mode is recreated 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 like a block and you put the texture 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.729
 original but I've already said that only 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.700
 put the texture not the block in that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.649
 early in the year 2011 still not 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.569
 they had added to the beds and they needed 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.399
 a block that will keep the spa a pin from the 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.810
 player who happened to put it and 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.939
 that served as a kind of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.349
 obelisk with that power but then you're 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.899
 happened the idea of the beds that 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.819
 obviously it was much better than some 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.829
 way this would work for us 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.630
 that we acted the block and put it 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.170
 in some way so that the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.090
 spam point instead of sleeping in a bed 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.610
 here you are watching a tweeter jeff on 23 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.399
 February 2011 in which someone 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 question obsidian with blue speckles 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.270
 what's in the textures file 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.129
 remember that the textures were saved 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.709
 before in a single file has not been 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:58.989
 implemented yet the whole world is 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.729
 pending the topic and he replies that it was 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:03.819
 an abandoned project that he had and left 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.829
 the texture and in the game to troll the 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.569
 March 30 of the same year another person 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.819
 he asked what the project was about 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.400
 abandoned to what he 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.459
 he answered is a bird ready to change 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 the spam point already in beta 1.5 the 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.299
 texture of the crying obsidian was removed 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.969
 of the game and it was replaced by this that 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.760
 you see here this is the margin of the block 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:27.040
 of fat grass but in gray on 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.439
 Once in green this would serve for the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.209
 texts packs so that the color is regulated 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.909
 for the biomes because as you can see in this 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.950
 tweet on April 14, 2011 said that the 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.840
 edge of this grass had replaced 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.489
 the cra in obsidian in the file of the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.469
 textures now let's see more 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.389
 information about this in the 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.000
 discussion of the wiki they asked him the 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.290
 April 21, 2011 that it seemed to him that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.659
 the crying block will be removed 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.030
 obsidian what he answered three days 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.459
 after he did not care and that never 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.590
 will be used in this tweet they will return to 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.750
 ask on November 26, 2011 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.239
 this time what was that project 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.129
 abandoned that I already knew that I already knew that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.019
 It was the gray did not help but I did not know 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.370
 why would it serve what you already 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.780
 he responds that it was a project for 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.849
 change the spam before I added in 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 the cameras another proof of this the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.989
 user asks another question the same 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.030
 day how would you get what it took you 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.280
 he answers that perhaps with lapis lazuli 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.430
 it would be really stupid that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.020
 block himself he thought that he should not 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
 to have added that it was much better 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.420
 beds in this other twit on February 9 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.910
 of 2011 and the next year almost a year 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.310
 happened since it was added 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.230
 until this tweet you are asked to return 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.120
 put your face and obsidian or add 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.970
 new blocks with new colors or 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.620
 textures and jeff replied that so soon 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.750
 how to make more room for new textures 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.340
 he will do this this means he would add 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.560
 new blocks and since that date they have 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.350
 added many but leaves us a small 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.900
 mystery we know that he was referring to others 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.450
 blocks but not that it's not clear if 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.730
 he also referred to the obsidian krajina 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.819
 it is possible that the vintage in some day with 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.340
 a decorative purpose or with another utility not 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.840
 it is known and another very curious fact is that 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.489
 also existed in the textures of 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.220
 pocket edition but in an update 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.810
 most recent was eliminated it may be that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.360
 they thought that although the project did not 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.069
 will work in pc yes that would serve for the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.049
 pocket edition but in the end I do not 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.609
 they put anywhere but I say 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.160
 that maybe one day they think of it 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.270
 put it back in order this is all 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.129
 about the Serbian krajina 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.900
 remember to read the descriptions of all 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.699
 videos in this series if I 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.310
 put there some information 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.690
 updated regarding the video I hope 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.979
 that you liked the video and see you 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.979
 in the next goodbye
