00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello friends welcome is imputable to the tenth truest and in the tutorial of 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.880
 today the sr 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.930
 moacir 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.099
 a head spinning 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.249
 like in the ones I have 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.879
 get moving 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.879
 days the ministers 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.409
 how was I have here to five 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.519
 Very good 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.209
 the first thing we have to do in the starting eleven and a third this morning 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.499
 and the first frame we're going to honor our character in front 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 this day must serve in two parts for what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.659
 messi brings as my last 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.720
 u tutorial 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 i good 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.180
 also so that it does not spread or and make them character quickly then 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 at the end they can 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.680
 possibly 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880
 notice that as a character is smaller than the other or something like that 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.080
 but you with more time I can make them more perfect possible 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160
 now that I have the staff and lebanon 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.850
 manolo to give a little bit that we think is a river 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.800
 once he has not drawn 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 I'm going to give efe six and I'm going to 17 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.090
 and in go abal 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.570
 the choice of onion paper that I have 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.600
 skin connection 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 the mind for the long pear brush 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.320
 for this the memory frame Wednesday 11 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.870
 for example how I want that without it I accelerate chavismo to put the eyes more 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.200
 more to the right 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 like the nose and nose in small arms 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.120
 for padilla for padilla and the ear 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.670
 Moscow - the staff without her as a young calm and seville 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 was going to put a brake on the field 15 30 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.939
 Lorraine make smaller 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.980
 and for example that month one that I have here to do more to the right 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.579
 again the c6 and c7 and we will continue doing this 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.959
 for example if they realize that they will be the panacea inside but that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.959
 it does not matter because that helps us the effect 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.319
 the regatta in a container looked like a wolf that almost did not go to see the inside 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.119
 in this already alone at the tip 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.199
 the pin will go down here 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.249
 the wolf president 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.409
 and here the hair joins with this 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.409
 i 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 crisis and deficit and debt 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.499
 do not 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.269
 For example rafael hair is going to go wrong from inside 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.929
 from the head joseph to 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.149
 for example 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.499
 if the hair before we did it like that 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.499
 now we are going to do it 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.059
 yes 7 7 and now for example for the nose by hacienda 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.339
 does something like that 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.159
 the ovum make closer 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 i continue with the other details 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.460
 16 17 inc 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.460
 let's say for the nose and lips to be like that 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.479
 it was raided like I did before but I'm going to be like that 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.590
 the best does not sanata almost now 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.439
 Libya is still the rest 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.360
 the hair to be much more in 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.499
 So much so that now 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.289
 yávar hair 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.310
 mention of hair and be much higher before and this year 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 he will see well he 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.309
 16 17 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:10.740
 you know, they will not see 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.759
 and the nose later 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.419
 very small and 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.419
 as well as a nation 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.240
 and the homeland be placed the ear 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.569
 and mentioned with a little more and they deserve 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.839
 we will be in aberdeen fox 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.839
 lew areces and 7 7 and the next frame 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.930
 it's going to be like it's still completely from behind 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.009
 then I have it 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.639
 and it is like that to win the two ears 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.810
 the lock 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.339
 almost the same but a little bit in half 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.559
 and ready 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.379
 Now what I'm going to do and colorless each frame to make it faster 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.219
 I'm going to give you a few hole recommendations recommendations better said 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.339
 for example if you are going to start with hair 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.020
 it is better than the color effect there will be monfort per frame the hair 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.740
 they have to be consulted about 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.960
 do not have to go colored truck every time you switch to télam 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.569
 another thing is that the kit on the onion paper 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.099
 point band the next frame and with the banal comal frame quilmes judge 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.119
 so I did that helps them do it marathon let's say 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:36.889
 colored as it has been for the previous frame same reason 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.969
 do not 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:46.039
 they have great are made of this was he I recommend that you live and that channel 5 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:48.789
 many more tutorials 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.599
 and the hiv the tutu tuxpan channel is that it also has good that gives the psuc 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.789
 well now it's going to be with the skin 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.789
 ears 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.430
 I'm still common 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.110
 with the operation 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.449
 the two units 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.469
 i 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.469
 I'm going to show you how is ours for now 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:28.850
 yes esteves 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.220
