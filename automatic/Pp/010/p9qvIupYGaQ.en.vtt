no<00:00:30.060> longer<00:00:30.330> use<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.900> sort<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.309> upgrade

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
no longer use that sort of upgrade

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.219 
no longer use that sort of upgrade
system<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.059> that's<00:00:33.179> a<00:00:33.269> positive<00:00:33.569> change<00:00:33.960> that

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:34.229 
system and that's a positive change that

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.770 
system and that's a positive change that
was<00:00:34.319> sort<00:00:34.499> of<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.620> concession<00:00:35.129> made<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
was sort of a concession made for the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.899 
was sort of a concession made for the
dark<00:00:36.989> below<00:00:37.170> DLC<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.729> the<00:00:38.819> way

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909 
dark below DLC because of the way

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.299 
dark below DLC because of the way
upgrades<00:00:39.359> worked<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.109> came<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
upgrades worked when that came out and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.279 
upgrades worked when that came out and
the<00:00:42.030> new<00:00:42.179> system<00:00:42.359> is<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> lot<00:00:42.780> better<00:00:42.989> than<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
the new system is a lot better than that

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.250 
the new system is a lot better than that
so<00:00:44.120> first<00:00:45.120> things<00:00:45.299> first<00:00:45.359> no<00:00:45.659> backup<00:00:46.019> plans

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so first things first no backup plans

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.419 
so first things first no backup plans
these<00:00:46.889> are<00:00:47.010> Titan<00:00:47.339> gloves<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.850> role<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:49.429> 111

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
these are Titan gloves this role is 111

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.939 
these are Titan gloves this role is 111
maximum<00:00:51.179> strength<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.659> pre<00:00:51.870> dlc<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.769> pre

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
maximum strength the pre dlc or the pre

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.129

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:55.139 
house of wolves maximum role for gloves

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:57.229 
house of wolves maximum role for gloves
is<00:00:55.260> 113<00:00:55.889> so<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.339> pretty<00:00:56.519> good<00:00:56.850> role<00:00:57.089> but

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
is 113 so this is a pretty good role but

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
is 113 so this is a pretty good role but
it's<00:00:57.359> hard<00:00:57.569> to<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.049> the<00:00:58.170> new<00:00:58.289> maximum<00:00:58.769> is

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's hard to say what the new maximum is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.949 
it's hard to say what the new maximum is
this<00:00:59.100> week<00:00:59.479> increases<00:01:00.479> the<00:01:00.539> duration<00:01:00.899> of

this week increases the duration of

force barrier and you know it's like I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.720 
force barrier and you know it's like I
said<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.590> hard<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.770> say<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.010> new<00:01:05.160> Max's<00:01:05.550> but

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
said it's hard to say with new Max's but

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.370 
said it's hard to say with new Max's but
it's<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.150> good<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.360> week<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.720> any<00:01:06.870> to<00:01:07.080> pick<00:01:07.230> these

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
of 144 again this is just under the pre

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.870 
of 144 again this is just under the pre
dlc<00:01:13.860> max<00:01:14.160> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.380> these<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.310> opinion<00:01:17.580> are

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
dlc max you know these in my opinion are

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.030 
dlc max you know these in my opinion are
under<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.510> an<00:01:18.630> underwhelming<00:01:18.990> exotic<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
under is an underwhelming exotic you

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.410 
under is an underwhelming exotic you
move<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.460> quickly<00:01:20.610> while<00:01:21.000> aiming<00:01:21.210> your

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
move more quickly while aiming your

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.010 
move more quickly while aiming your
weapon<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> boots<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.640> i<00:01:24.270> think

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
weapon and it's the boots lot so i think

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.060 
weapon and it's the boots lot so i think
some<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> other<00:01:25.410> slots<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.860> better

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
some of the other slots have better

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.410 
some of the other slots have better
perks<00:01:26.370> but<00:01:26.550> if<00:01:26.730> you<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:26.940> have<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.210> it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
perks but if you don't have them it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.980 
perks but if you don't have them it's
not<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.900> bad<00:01:28.200> role<00:01:28.820> start<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> fire<00:01:29.970> protocol<00:01:30.750> for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
not a bad role start a fire protocol for

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.440 
not a bad role start a fire protocol for
warlocks<00:01:31.430> 175<00:01:32.430> intellect<00:01:32.850> role<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.300> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
warlocks 175 intellect role so this is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
warlocks 175 intellect role so this is
soundly<00:01:33.870> above<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.130> maximum

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
soundly above what was the maximum

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.480 
soundly above what was the maximum
before<00:01:36.270> house<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:37.110> wolves<00:01:37.260> chess<00:01:38.040> pieces<00:01:38.280> were

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
before house of wolves chess pieces were

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
before house of wolves chess pieces were
170<00:01:39.120> before<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.960> 175<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:40.980> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
170 before so this is 175 so this is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
170 before so this is 175 so this is
evidence<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.580> at<00:01:42.030> least<00:01:42.120> 175<00:01:43.880> chess<00:01:44.880> pieces
