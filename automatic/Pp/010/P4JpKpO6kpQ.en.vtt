by exam for calm no more fear from exam
next<00:00:09.990> disease<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.360> ambiences<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.570> ambach

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
next disease is ambiences for ambach

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.919 
next disease is ambiences for ambach
this<00:00:13.440> entry<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.549> let's<00:00:14.910> look<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> pathogen

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
this entry so let's look at the pathogen

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.470 
this entry so let's look at the pathogen
which<00:00:16.109> causes<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.800> BBS's<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.760> away<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.300> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
which causes a BBS's or away with this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.160 
which causes a BBS's or away with this
entry

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
entry

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.730 
entry
so<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> pathogen<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:21.020> protozoa<00:00:22.020> again<00:00:22.470> and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
so the pathogen is a protozoa again and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.179 
so the pathogen is a protozoa again and
it<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.100> entamoeba<00:00:23.670> histolytica<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it is entamoeba histolytica so this is

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.120 
it is entamoeba histolytica so this is
the<00:00:26.730> specific<00:00:27.410> pathogen<00:00:28.410> which<00:00:28.590> causes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the specific pathogen which causes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.880 
the specific pathogen which causes
arabic<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.970> entry<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.199> happens<00:00:31.679> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
arabic this entry now what happens in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.240 
arabic this entry now what happens in
this<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.399> mean<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.739> package<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.920> enter

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this I mean how do this package it enter

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.630 
this I mean how do this package it enter
inside<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> body<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.329> human<00:00:36.690> beings<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> its

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
inside the body of human beings so its

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
inside the body of human beings so its
energy<00:00:38.820> enters<00:00:39.450> through<00:00:39.660> contaminated<00:00:40.140> food

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
energy enters through contaminated food

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.819 
energy enters through contaminated food
and<00:00:41.129> drinking<00:00:41.640> water<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:43.110> has<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and drinking water but it also has a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
and drinking water but it also has a
transmitting<00:00:44.640> agent<00:00:45.120> involved<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.840> what

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
transmitting agent involved and what

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
transmitting agent involved and what
does<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> transmitting<00:00:47.129> agent<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> house

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
does the transmitting agent it is house

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.709 
does the transmitting agent it is house
plant

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
plant

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.619 
plant
now<00:00:49.230> how<00:00:49.440> house<00:00:49.829> fly<00:00:50.160> acts<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.850> transmitting

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
now how house fly acts as a transmitting

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
now how house fly acts as a transmitting
agent<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.710> nothing<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.399> mechanical

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
agent is it is nothing but a mechanical

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
agent is it is nothing but a mechanical
carrier<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:56.090> pathogen<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> does

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
carrier of the pathogen so what it does

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.540 
carrier of the pathogen so what it does
is<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.850> parasites<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.260> proto<00:01:01.859> ZOA<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.190> mean

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
is these parasites the proto ZOA I mean

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
is these parasites the proto ZOA I mean
so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> parasites<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.870> present<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so the parasites are present in the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.520 
so the parasites are present in the
faeces<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> infected<00:01:06.360> person<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.409> now

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
faeces of the infected person so now

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.070 
faeces of the infected person so now
what<00:01:07.740> happens<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.820> house<00:01:09.150> light<00:01:09.570> will

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
what happens is this house light will

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320 
what happens is this house light will
carry<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.650> parasites<00:01:11.220> from<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> pieces<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
carry the parasites from the pieces and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840 
carry the parasites from the pieces and
then<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.049> will<00:01:13.229> carry<00:01:13.500> into<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> food<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
then it will carry into the food of a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.780 
then it will carry into the food of a
normal<00:01:15.330> person<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.110> let's<00:01:16.530> suppose<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
normal person so let's suppose this is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.789 
normal person so let's suppose this is
the<00:01:18.000> parasite<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> parasite<00:01:19.619> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the parasite this is the parasite is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.160 
the parasite this is the parasite is
present<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> faeces<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.900> if

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
present in the faeces up in here now if

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
present in the faeces up in here now if
this<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> house<00:01:22.890> flies<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> house<00:01:23.670> by<00:01:23.939> fly

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this is the house flies the house by fly

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.929 
this is the house flies the house by fly
will<00:01:24.540> sit<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> faeces<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.369> take

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
will sit on the faeces and it will take

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.630 
will sit on the faeces and it will take
the<00:01:27.270> backside<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.530> parasite<00:01:29.040> again<00:01:29.430> when

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the backside and the parasite again when

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
the backside and the parasite again when
it<00:01:29.759> sits<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.450> food<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.930> another<00:01:31.170> person<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it sits on the food of another person so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
it sits on the food of another person so
it<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:33.360> transmits<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> parasite

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it can actually transmits the parasite

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
it can actually transmits the parasite
in<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.700> food<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> food<00:01:36.840> becomes

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
in this food so the food becomes

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.560 
in this food so the food becomes
contaminated<00:01:37.680> now<00:01:38.310> when<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.790> person<00:01:39.060> eats

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
contaminated now when this person eats

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200 
contaminated now when this person eats
this<00:01:39.900> cake<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> cake<00:01:41.130> actually<00:01:41.310> has<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
this cake so the cake actually has the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
this cake so the cake actually has the
pathogen<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> result<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
pathogen in it and as a result the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.480 
pathogen in it and as a result the
person<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.810> suffer<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> person<00:01:47.340> will

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
person will suffer or the person will

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.530 
person will suffer or the person will
get<00:01:47.610> infected<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.630> entamoeba<00:01:49.110> histolytica

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
get infected with entamoeba histolytica

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
get infected with entamoeba histolytica
now<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.960> transmission<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.950> take<00:01:53.250> place<00:01:53.579> not

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
now this transmission can take place not

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
now this transmission can take place not
only<00:01:53.970> through<00:01:54.509> drinking<00:01:54.960> water<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.680> food

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
only through drinking water and food

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.999 
only through drinking water and food
that<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.210> also<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:58.009> contaminated

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that it can also be contaminated

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.960 
that it can also be contaminated
transmitted<00:01:59.790> through<00:02:00.000> dirty<00:02:00.240> hands

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
transmitted through dirty hands

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.780 
transmitted through dirty hands
objects<00:02:01.600> or<00:02:01.720> animal<00:02:02.500> oral<00:02:02.890> contact<00:02:03.340> because

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
objects or animal oral contact because

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.720 
objects or animal oral contact because
here<00:02:04.120> this<00:02:04.660> type<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:05.160> packaging<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.310> mostly

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
here this type of packaging is mostly

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.210 
here this type of packaging is mostly
found<00:02:06.940> in<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.420> freezes<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.710> therefore

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
found in the freezes so therefore

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.000 
found in the freezes so therefore
content<00:02:10.210> if<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.630> food<00:02:10.930> or<00:02:11.260> drinking<00:02:11.740> water

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
content if the food or drinking water

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.040 
content if the food or drinking water
somehow<00:02:12.460> gets<00:02:12.850> contaminated<00:02:13.270> with<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
somehow gets contaminated with the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.470 
somehow gets contaminated with the
faeces<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.070> can<00:02:15.370> become<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.910> source<00:02:16.210> of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
faeces then that can become a source of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.070 
faeces then that can become a source of
infection<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.820> now<00:02:18.910> what<00:02:19.180> happens<00:02:19.600> once<00:02:19.870> it

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
infection so now what happens once it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080 
infection so now what happens once it
enters<00:02:20.290> inside<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.130> body<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.610> primarily

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
enters inside the body it primarily

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.500 
enters inside the body it primarily
affects<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.930> large<00:02:23.200> intestine<00:02:24.010> now<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:25.390> all

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
affects the large intestine now we all

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.050 
affects the large intestine now we all
know<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.320> large<00:02:26.650> intestine<00:02:27.060> responsible

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
know what is large intestine responsible

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.600 
know what is large intestine responsible
for<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.660> large<00:02:28.900> intestine<00:02:29.590> partially<00:02:30.220> helps

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
for the large intestine partially helps

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.730 
for the large intestine partially helps
in<00:02:30.790> digestion<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.230> its<00:02:32.440> most

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
in digestion but one of its most

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.240 
in digestion but one of its most
important<00:02:33.459> job<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:35.440> ejection

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
important job it is to the is ejection

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.449 
important job it is to the is ejection
that<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.940> removal<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.080> undigested<00:02:38.740> matter

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
that is removal of the undigested matter

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.780 
that is removal of the undigested matter
out<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.450> body<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.370> also<00:02:42.610> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
out of the body so that is also a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.949 
out of the body so that is also a
primary<00:02:43.540> function<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.390> large

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
primary function of this the large

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.960 
primary function of this the large
intestine<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.980> now<00:02:48.100> when<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.520> pathogen

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
intestine so now when this pathogen

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.510 
intestine so now when this pathogen
effects<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> large<00:02:50.020> intestine<00:02:50.740> then<00:02:51.250> what

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
effects the large intestine then what

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.280 
effects the large intestine then what
happens<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.120> there<00:02:52.570> are<00:02:52.750> issues<00:02:53.020> with

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
happens is that there are issues with

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.890 
happens is that there are issues with
them<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> symptoms<00:02:54.580> which<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:55.390> will

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
them so the symptoms which you see will

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.410 
them so the symptoms which you see will
be<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.470> mediation<00:02:56.920> process<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.820> even

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
be with that mediation process so even

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.330 
be with that mediation process so even
though<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:58.780> are<00:02:58.900> able<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.290> digest<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.040> food

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
though you are able to digest the food

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.580 
though you are able to digest the food
to<00:03:00.580> some<00:03:00.730> extent<00:03:01.180> by<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.480> process<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.200> ization

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
to some extent by the process of ization

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.560 
to some extent by the process of ization
that<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.040> removal<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.760> undigested<00:03:04.150> food

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
that is removal of the undigested food

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.380 
that is removal of the undigested food
doesn't<00:03:05.470> happen<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.160> proper<00:03:06.580> way<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.239> let<00:03:07.360> us

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
doesn't happen in a proper way so let us

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.240 
doesn't happen in a proper way so let us
look<00:03:07.690> at<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.050> symptoms<00:03:08.530> which<00:03:08.769> will<00:03:08.950> tell<00:03:09.130> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
look at the symptoms which will tell it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.670 
look at the symptoms which will tell it
more<00:03:09.459> clearly<00:03:09.910> now<00:03:10.239> some<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.230> symptoms

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
more clearly now some of the symptoms

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.320 
more clearly now some of the symptoms
are<00:03:11.769> abdominal<00:03:11.920> cramps<00:03:12.910> at<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.120> lower

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
are abdominal cramps at the lower

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.210 
are abdominal cramps at the lower
abdomen<00:03:13.870> where<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.410> large<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:15.010> tank

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
abdomen where you large with this tank

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.850 
abdomen where you large with this tank
is<00:03:15.430> located<00:03:15.630> stools<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:16.989> blood<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.560> mucus

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
is located stools with blood and mucus

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.860 
is located stools with blood and mucus
now<00:03:18.430> stools<00:03:18.820> are<00:03:19.090> something<00:03:19.510> which<00:03:19.690> are

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
now stools are something which are

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.720 
now stools are something which are
related<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.709> process<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.250> ingestion

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
related to the process of ingestion

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.570 
related to the process of ingestion
water<00:03:22.150> situation<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.260> unjust<00:03:23.650> undigested

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
water situation the unjust undigested

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.790 
water situation the unjust undigested
food<00:03:24.700> will<00:03:25.150> come<00:03:25.180> out<00:03:25.690> in<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.050> form<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.410> stools

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
food will come out in the form of stools

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.560 
food will come out in the form of stools
or<00:03:27.070> pieces<00:03:27.489> whatever<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.000> call<00:03:28.269> it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
or pieces whatever you call it

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.210 
or pieces whatever you call it
so<00:03:28.870> these<00:03:29.019> stools<00:03:29.440> are<00:03:29.739> generally

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
so these stools are generally

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.310 
so these stools are generally
accompanied<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.150> blood<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.049> mucus

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
constipation now treatment as I said see

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.750 
constipation now treatment as I said see
they<00:03:38.200> are<00:03:38.320> all<00:03:38.500> related<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.190> process<00:03:39.670> of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
they are all related to the process of

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.640 
they are all related to the process of
ingestion<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.049> because<00:03:41.380> large

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650

ingestion that is because large
intestine<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.280> involved<00:03:43.120> here<00:03:43.330> now<00:03:43.930> how<00:03:44.260> do<00:03:44.320> we

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
intestine is involved here now how do we

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.130 
intestine is involved here now how do we
treat<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:45.190> okay<00:03:45.970> now<00:03:46.269> when<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.600> say<00:03:46.810> blood

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
treat this okay now when you say blood

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.990 
treat this okay now when you say blood
from<00:03:47.500> where<00:03:47.709> do<00:03:47.860> we<00:03:47.980> get<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.400> flat<00:03:48.670> from

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
from where do we get this flat from

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.690 
from where do we get this flat from
where<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.480> blood<00:03:49.810> comes<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.470> stools<00:03:51.100> now

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
where this blood comes on the stools now

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.320 
where this blood comes on the stools now
the<00:03:52.239> blood<00:03:52.570> actually<00:03:52.870> comes<00:03:53.560> when<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
the blood actually comes when the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.230 
the blood actually comes when the
pathogen<00:03:55.330> invades<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.470> lining<00:03:56.920> of

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
pathogen invades the lining of

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.210 
pathogen invades the lining of
large<00:03:57.420> intestines<00:03:58.020> as<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.380> said<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.710> pathogen

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
large intestines as I said the pathogen

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.590 
large intestines as I said the pathogen
will<00:03:59.430> directly<00:03:59.850> impact<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.390> large

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
will directly impact the large

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.470 
will directly impact the large
understand<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.650> when<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:01.890> starts<00:04:02.790> tearing<00:04:03.090> up

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
understand so when I starts tearing up

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.720 
understand so when I starts tearing up
the<00:04:03.660> lining<00:04:04.050> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.320> large<00:04:04.530> intestine<00:04:04.770> so

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
the lining of the large intestine so
