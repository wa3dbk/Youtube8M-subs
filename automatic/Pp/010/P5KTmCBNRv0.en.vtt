some good races for sure and also some
bad<00:03:25.970> right<00:03:26.180> here<00:03:26.210> but<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.960> blocks<00:03:27.250> track

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
bad right here but to the blocks track

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.600 
bad right here but to the blocks track
was<00:03:28.430> pretty<00:03:28.670> gnarly<00:03:29.090> from<00:03:29.420> today<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.610> wind

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
was pretty gnarly from today and wind

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.600 
was pretty gnarly from today and wind
was<00:03:31.730> blowing<00:03:31.940> earlier<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:33.310> tried<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.430> drug

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
was blowing earlier and tried the drug

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.250 
was blowing earlier and tried the drug
out<00:03:34.790> once<00:03:35.060> our<00:03:36.520> main<00:03:37.520> event<00:03:37.610> or<00:03:38.170> figuration<00:03:39.170> we

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
out once our main event or figuration we

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.460 
out once our main event or figuration we
went<00:03:39.440> out<00:03:39.530> there<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.770> was<00:03:39.890> so<00:03:40.190> muddy<00:03:40.430> fresh<00:03:41.470> and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
went out there it was so muddy fresh and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.910 
went out there it was so muddy fresh and
then<00:03:42.620> along<00:03:42.890> with<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:45.200> what<00:03:45.530> came<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.830> the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
then along with and what came on the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.380 
then along with and what came on the
made<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.220> was<00:03:46.310> completely<00:03:46.640> different<00:03:47.030> ultra

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
made it was completely different ultra

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.090 
made it was completely different ultra
there<00:03:47.570> was<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> big<00:03:47.990> gap<00:03:48.020> because<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.740> schedule

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
there was a big gap because the schedule

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.210 
there was a big gap because the schedule
is<00:03:49.160> different<00:03:52.840> how<00:03:53.840> was<00:03:53.960> that<00:03:54.110> tire<00:03:54.860> traffic

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
is different how was that tire traffic

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.270 
is different how was that tire traffic
or<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.490> robot<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.350> just<00:03:57.350> didn't<00:03:58.130> feel<00:03:58.250> like

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
or that robot I just didn't feel like

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.860 
or that robot I just didn't feel like
trying<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.850> hard<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.150> get<00:03:59.330> off<00:03:59.570> of<00:03:59.840> that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
trying that hard to get off of that

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.140 
trying that hard to get off of that
thing<00:03:59.960> and<00:04:00.260> clear<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.650> so<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:01.280> figured<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.060> was

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
thing and clear it so I figured it was

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.670 
thing and clear it so I figured it was
just<00:04:02.180> easier<00:04:02.600> for<00:04:02.630> me<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:03.080> to<00:04:03.140> kind<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.410> just

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
just easier for me just to kind of just

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.460 
just easier for me just to kind of just
almost<00:04:04.040> ride<00:04:04.550> off<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:04.970> faster<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.050> wheel

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
almost ride off it faster you just wheel

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.390 
almost ride off it faster you just wheel
tap<00:04:06.710> off<00:04:06.890> our<00:04:07.100> don't<00:04:07.550> look<00:04:07.700> sleek<00:04:07.910> or<00:04:09.280> skip<00:04:10.280> for
