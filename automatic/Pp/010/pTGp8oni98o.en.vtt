always my favorite skill I don't know

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.200 
always my favorite skill I don't know
why<00:00:13.710> exactly<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.639> most<00:00:14.790> likely<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
why exactly but it's most likely the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.460 
why exactly but it's most likely the
fact<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.509> was<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:15.839> skill<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.260> ever

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
fact that was the first skill I ever

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.170 
fact that was the first skill I ever
trained<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.400> remember<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.789> had<00:00:18.029> around
