00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.050
 HallÃ¶chen friends and cordially 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.840
 Welcome to a whole new video 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.030
 here on our channel and that's it 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.150
 today a video of something else 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 art there is in fact a ten facts about 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 minecraft video 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.210
 Have fun with it, yes people, we come to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 very first fact and indeed by ice or 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.610
 through water you can see only slightly 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.090
 The particles of a net as porter only 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 this little purple particles and not 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.040
 this yes this portal texture exactly that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040
 same with water 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.350
 so 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.670
 Picture frames you can if you can not 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:02.290
 even magic tables are based on one 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.610
 Anvil of the workbench an oven and also 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.700
 Place the score sheet 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.750
 Of course, this is also possible with the energy 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.369
 one would only make right-click now 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.360
 of course, then would be in the case 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.450
 open the chest 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.110
 the next act with bone meal you can 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.680
 no cactus no sugar cane no lian 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.130
 and also no annoying wart grow 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:34.149
 Let's get friends like that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:39.270
 nummero 24 or kreml with one 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.270
 cliff jerk off is always flint out 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.890
 Of course, this is also possible 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.220
 different couplings between two 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.450
 enchantments here eg the combination 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.709
 luck 3 and efficiency, however , you have 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:02.259
 only luck two as here meets this 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:04.599
 Do not always say yes to next 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.080
 I just want to show you how 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:10.840
 well the enchantment cousin is full and 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.770
 I've just got a few 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 Boots on fault four 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.290
 Enchanted and jumping is here 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.670
 sleek 37 blocks down and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.670
 we'll just see what happens 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.430
 easily survived with three and a half hearts 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.190
 So as I said just survived here in 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.020
 So high heels or something makes it whole 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.819
 Have fun and have fun 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.830
 But do not jump too much distance 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.590
 yes people now I just wanted you 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.950
 let's show that an anvil is really strong 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.950
 can be 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:56.180
 zack all dead yes the next fact was 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.159
 implemented with the version 1.5 and 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 though i can burn burning zombies 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.170
 now also set in flames 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.200
 now it counts here 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.819
 I am burning too, I have died 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.190
 people and there we are already at 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.400
 the very last fact and although you can with 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.090
 boats willi betz respectively 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.230
 lily pads destroy so markus 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.230
 works exactly 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.209
 that worked very well if 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.849
 it also a bit 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.239
 yes you even get it sometimes then 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.189
 into the inventory we see here and yes that 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.470
 is quite good because they used to be 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.359
 Of course always there the shattered 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.239
 boats and you always have the 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.930
 get back items and find so 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.930

 nee not really fun but aside 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.329

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.570

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:19.909

 right click no I am now woman 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.180
 Now a tip that is especially good around 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.999
 for example, under water 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:53.039
 clay man has just taken a door 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:54.870
 Dives with sets and already has 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.870
 Here's a little waterhole 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.319
 so to speak, can be quite supple in clay 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.319
