00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.829
 metal cephalotes for a small 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.349
 new video today we get 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:16.689
 find plume level 6 lives of 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.760
 type farming the request of my friend manu 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.590
 I make him a big dedication because 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
 that manu made me my way I the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.089
 thank you very much so I owe him 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.529
 that and also for you I do at age 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:31.179
 v6 So this one life that swim if 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.940
 what I found really versatile 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.020
 especially that the resources are rather 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.469
 spaced 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.399
 they are not grouped in one you 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.969
 so you can relatively save your 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.410
 resources 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.449
 but the resources still have 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.719
 close to the mortars so they will be very 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.960
 well covered by the wizard's towers 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.370
 and that's where you can see that he 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.079
 are two exits towers is rather 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.359
 close to each other 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.420
 from each other you can put it to 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.089
 the opposite is not serious you can 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.799
 change places after it's up to you to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.020
 see if you like con spinning like 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.229
 he's leaving it there will be no worries 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 so I try everything I have to say 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.740
 good sign 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.480
 I
