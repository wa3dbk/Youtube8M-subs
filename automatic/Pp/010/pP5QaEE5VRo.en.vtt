now<00:00:41.879> let's<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.149> into<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.360> advanced<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now let's get into some advanced for it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.240 
now let's get into some advanced for it
ameno<00:00:43.260> things<00:00:43.590> we're<00:00:43.829> gonna<00:00:43.920> look<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
ameno things we're gonna look at the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
ameno things we're gonna look at the
grit<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> grid<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.629> nothing<00:00:46.140> more

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
grit now the grid is really nothing more

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
grit now the grid is really nothing more
than<00:00:46.350> mathematical<00:00:47.070> formula<00:00:47.579> where<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> take

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
than mathematical formula where you take

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
than mathematical formula where you take
each<00:00:48.570> part<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.320> rudiment<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> accent

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
each part of a rudiment and you accent

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.279 
each part of a rudiment and you accent
it<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> time<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> change<00:00:52.050> where

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it one of the time so you change where

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
it one of the time so you change where
it's<00:00:52.410> naturally<00:00:52.559> accented<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.059> people<00:00:54.449> have

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it's naturally accented so people have

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.700 
it's naturally accented so people have
been<00:00:54.660> doing<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> long<00:00:55.260> time<00:00:55.320> with

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
been doing this for a long time with

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
been doing this for a long time with
languages<00:00:56.190> where<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.910> change<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> accent

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
languages where you change the accent

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.880 
languages where you change the accent
and<00:00:57.960> therefore<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> meaning<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and therefore the meaning of the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
and therefore the meaning of the
sentence<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> changes<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.149> instance<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
sentence kind of changes for instance I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
sentence kind of changes for instance I
went<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> store<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.309> went<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> store<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
went to the store I went to the store I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
went to the store I went to the store I
went<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> store<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.100> went<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> store<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
went to the store I went to the store I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
went to the store I went to the store I
went<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> store<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.740> each<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> those

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
went to the store so each one of those

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.130 
went to the store so each one of those
has<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> slightly<00:01:09.090> different<00:01:09.270> meaning<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.960> by

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
has a slightly different meaning just by

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
has a slightly different meaning just by
changing<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> emphasis<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
changing the emphasis so here with the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.570 
changing the emphasis so here with the
rudiments<00:01:12.810> let's<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> flam<00:01:14.250> drag

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
rudiments let's say we have a flam drag

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480 
rudiments let's say we have a flam drag
you'd<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.630> shut<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.310> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you'd have shut take it because there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
you'd have shut take it because there
are<00:01:17.549> three<00:01:17.670> partials<00:01:18.150> normally<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.170> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
are three partials normally now if we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
are three partials normally now if we
move<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> accent<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> second<00:01:20.580> beat<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
move the accent to the second beat we

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.499 
move the accent to the second beat we
have<00:01:21.090> shut<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> third

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
have shut they get it or to the third

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
have shut they get it or to the third
take<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> dot<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:25.830> doing<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.460> can

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
take it dot so by doing that you can

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.520 
take it dot so by doing that you can
play<00:01:26.820> totally<00:01:27.299> different<00:01:27.600> things<00:01:27.840> based<00:01:28.320> on

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
play totally different things based on

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.080 
play totally different things based on
the<00:01:28.680> same<00:01:28.860> rudiment<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.850> feel

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the same rudiment but they feel

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
the same rudiment but they feel
different<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.600> hands<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.110> sound

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
different your hands they sound

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.719 
different your hands they sound
differently<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> different<00:01:32.430> overall

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
differently have a different overall

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
differently have a different overall
effect<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.200> drummers<00:01:34.530> talk<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
effect now in drummers talk about the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.350 
effect now in drummers talk about the
grid<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.490> generally<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
grid they generally go right to the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.050 
grid they generally go right to the
exercise<00:01:36.750> 421<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> believe<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> Tom

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
exercise 421 now I believe this is Tom

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.760 
exercise 421 now I believe this is Tom
Flo's<00:01:39.360> contribution<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> drumming

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
Flo's contribution to the drumming

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
Flo's contribution to the drumming
community<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> basically<00:01:42.210> play<00:01:42.840> ever

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
community and basically play ever

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
community and basically play ever
written<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.439> three<00:01:43.560> partials<00:01:44.070> you'll<00:01:44.640> play

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
written with three partials you'll play

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.190 
written with three partials you'll play
it<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> accent<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.659> first<00:01:45.899> partial

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it with the accent on the first partial

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
it with the accent on the first partial
four<00:01:46.590> times<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.579> four<00:01:47.850> times<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> exit<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
four times then four times the exit of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
four times then four times the exit of
the<00:01:48.720> second<00:01:49.110> partial<00:01:49.320> four<00:01:50.130> times<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> acts

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the second partial four times the acts

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.760 
the second partial four times the acts
in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> third<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> same<00:01:52.470> thing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
in the third then you do the same thing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
in the third then you do the same thing
but<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> each<00:01:53.579> repeat<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:55.079> one

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
but two of each repeat it and then one

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
but two of each repeat it and then one
of<00:01:55.500> each<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.369> four<00:01:56.670> times<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
of each and you do that four times so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
of each and you do that four times so
basically<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> count<00:01:58.680> triplets<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.670> have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
basically if you count triplets you have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.030 
basically if you count triplets you have
triple<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> triple<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.380> triple<00:02:01.829> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
triple that triple that triple that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.429 
triple that triple that triple that
triple<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.939> bullets<00:02:03.420> bullets<00:02:03.780> bullets

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439

to<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.730> pulse<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:30.840> when<00:02:31.019> we<00:02:31.140> drum<00:02:31.379> rudiments

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
to a pulse now when we drum rudiments

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
to a pulse now when we drum rudiments
like<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.220> not<00:02:33.120> only<00:02:33.299> does<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.659> sound<00:02:33.959> we're

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
like that not only does the sound we're

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.020 
like that not only does the sound we're
making<00:02:34.439> change<00:02:34.769> but<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.220> muscles<00:02:35.609> we<00:02:35.790> need

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
making change but the muscles we need

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
making change but the muscles we need
and<00:02:36.480> techniques<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.140> need<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.349> play<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.680> change

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and techniques we need to play it change

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.069 
and techniques we need to play it change
it<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.250> becomes<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.549> interesting<00:02:39.359> so<00:02:39.930> let

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
it so it becomes very interesting so let

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.449 
it so it becomes very interesting so let
me<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.290> real<00:02:40.470> quick<00:02:40.680> I'll<00:02:40.859> demonstrate<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
me just real quick I'll demonstrate a

00:02:41.459 --> 00:03:05.059 
me just real quick I'll demonstrate a
flam<00:02:41.879> accident<00:02:42.389> with<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> 14-1<00:02:43.530> grid<00:03:03.829> now<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.859> lot

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
flam accident with a 14-1 grid now a lot

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.979 
flam accident with a 14-1 grid now a lot
of<00:03:05.099> people<00:03:05.250> rely<00:03:05.639> on<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.909> 14:1<00:03:06.480> system<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
of people rely on that 14:1 system to

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.360 
of people rely on that 14:1 system to
get<00:03:07.109> through<00:03:07.349> these<00:03:07.500> things<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.129> think

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
get through these things but I think

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.250 
get through these things but I think
it's<00:03:08.459> very<00:03:08.669> important<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.689> can<00:03:09.900> start

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
it's very important that you can start

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.050 
it's very important that you can start
with<00:03:10.409> an<00:03:10.530> accent<00:03:10.919> of<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.010> downbeat<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.579> then

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
with an accent of the downbeat and then

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.699 
with an accent of the downbeat and then
move<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.480> rudiment<00:03:12.870> through<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.560> it's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
move the rudiment through to so it's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.710 
move the rudiment through to so it's
kind<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:13.919> a<00:03:14.010> displacement<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.849> really<00:03:15.599> that's

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
kind of a displacement and really that's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.690 
kind of a displacement and really that's
another<00:03:16.079> way<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.349> gritting<00:03:16.859> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.370> keep<00:03:17.579> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
another way of gritting you can keep the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.699 
another way of gritting you can keep the
accident<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.180> downbeat<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.750> then<00:03:19.199> move<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
accident the downbeat and then move the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.439 
accident the downbeat and then move the
rudiment<00:03:20.159> through<00:03:20.489> kind<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.120> lucky<00:03:21.269> you

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
rudiment through kind of lucky you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.149 
rudiment through kind of lucky you
invert<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.260> flam<00:03:22.500> instead<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.979> being

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
invert it to the flam instead of being

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.330 
invert it to the flam instead of being
on<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.489> starts<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.449> two<00:03:24.629> or<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.079> three<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.310> I

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
on one starts on two or on three so I

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.009 
on one starts on two or on three so I
made<00:03:26.549> up<00:03:26.579> an<00:03:26.729> exercise<00:03:26.940> called<00:03:27.359> Fredrickson

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
made up an exercise called Fredrickson

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.930 
made up an exercise called Fredrickson
rhythm<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.349> illogic<00:03:28.769> where<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.099> do<00:03:29.400> exactly

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
rhythm in illogic where I do exactly

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.539 
rhythm in illogic where I do exactly
that<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.379> most<00:03:31.590> popular<00:03:32.040> shopping<00:03:32.310> for

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
that with the most popular shopping for

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.270 
that with the most popular shopping for
your<00:03:32.639> rudiments<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.349> flam<00:03:34.349> drag<00:03:34.680> cheese

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
your rudiments like flam drag cheese

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.149 
your rudiments like flam drag cheese
flam<00:03:36.000> five<00:03:36.349> shuttle<00:03:37.349> gel<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.680> cheese<00:03:37.889> cheddar

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
flam five shuttle gel and cheese cheddar

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.659 
flam five shuttle gel and cheese cheddar
chess<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:39.000> that's<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.389> look<00:03:39.479> like<00:03:39.510> this

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
chess so that's going to look like this

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.649 
chess so that's going to look like this
one<00:03:41.669> maxim<00:03:42.030> check<00:03:43.010> for<00:03:44.010> maxing<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:44.699> check

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
one maxim check for maxing on one check

00:03:45.659 --> 00:04:37.650 
one maxim check for maxing on one check
no<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:47.870> check<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.709> three

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.610 

so<00:04:38.660> now<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.840> we've<00:04:39.050> learned<00:04:39.230> all<00:04:39.500> those

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
so now that we've learned all those

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.110 
so now that we've learned all those
rudiments<00:04:40.130> starting<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.580> different<00:04:40.850> places

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
rudiments starting in different places

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.960 
rudiments starting in different places
we<00:04:41.630> can<00:04:41.780> go<00:04:41.930> back<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.470> 41<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.460> actually

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
we can go back to that 41 and actually

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.250 
we can go back to that 41 and actually
run<00:04:44.270> rudiments<00:04:44.780> through<00:04:45.020> it

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
run rudiments through it

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.410 
run rudiments through it
starting<00:04:45.890> on<00:04:45.980> different<00:04:46.310> spots<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.330> to

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
starting on different spots so to

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.590 
starting on different spots so to
demonstrate<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:48.200> I'll<00:04:48.440> do<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.830> flam<00:04:49.330> 541<00:04:50.330> grid

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
demonstrate that I'll do a flam 541 grid

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.630 
demonstrate that I'll do a flam 541 grid
and<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.410> first<00:04:51.650> time<00:04:51.860> I'll<00:04:52.130> play<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.460> flam

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
and the first time I'll play the flam

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.440 
and the first time I'll play the flam
five<00:04:52.970> one<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.300> downbeat<00:04:53.450> arms<00:04:54.170> like<00:04:54.320> this

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
five one the downbeat arms like this

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.000 
five one the downbeat arms like this
second<00:04:56.450> time<00:04:56.630> I'll<00:04:56.870> move<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.230> flam<00:04:57.470> five<00:04:57.770> so

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
second time I'll move the flam five so

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.220 
second time I'll move the flam five so
the<00:04:58.160> flam<00:04:58.430> starts<00:04:58.940> on<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.180> second<00:04:59.540> beat<00:04:59.660> with

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
the flam starts on the second beat with

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.850 
the flam starts on the second beat with
the<00:05:00.350> accent<00:05:00.680> staying<00:05:00.860> on<00:05:01.010> one<00:05:02.590> third<00:05:03.590> time

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
the accent staying on one third time

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.470 
the accent staying on one third time
I'll<00:05:04.130> move<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.610> again<00:05:04.700> Center<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.210> flam<00:05:05.450> is

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
I'll move it again Center the flam is

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.910 
I'll move it again Center the flam is
gonna<00:05:05.780> be<00:05:05.870> on<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.020> third<00:05:06.260> beat<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.710> it'll

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
gonna be on the third beat and it'll

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.380 
gonna be on the third beat and it'll
start<00:05:07.100> like<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.830> here<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.190> four<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.760> one<00:05:10.970> flam

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
start like so here is four to one flam

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.690 
start like so here is four to one flam
five<00:05:11.720> starting<00:05:12.290> on<00:05:12.410> one<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:12.920> then<00:05:13.340> starting

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
five starting on one and then starting

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:47.790 
five starting on one and then starting
on<00:05:13.760> two<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:14.330> then<00:05:14.450> starting<00:05:14.810> on<00:05:14.930> three<00:05:31.930> on<00:05:32.930> two

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:06:07.150 

and<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:48.950> three<00:06:05.260> so<00:06:06.260> you<00:06:06.320> can<00:06:06.500> see<00:06:06.680> these<00:06:06.890> things

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
and on three so you can see these things

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.460 
and on three so you can see these things
can<00:06:07.280> get<00:06:07.370> pretty<00:06:07.610> complex<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.510> recommend<00:06:09.290> you

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
can get pretty complex I recommend you

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.900 
can get pretty complex I recommend you
start<00:06:09.680> with<00:06:09.890> simple<00:06:10.070> rudiments<00:06:10.669> without

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
start with simple rudiments without

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.760 
start with simple rudiments without
flam's<00:06:11.270> to<00:06:11.570> get<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:11.780> concept<00:06:12.260> of<00:06:12.380> gridding

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
flam's to get the concept of gridding

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.500 
flam's to get the concept of gridding
really<00:06:13.460> watch<00:06:13.669> your<00:06:13.850> stick<00:06:14.090> Heights<00:06:14.300> and

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
really watch your stick Heights and

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.630 
really watch your stick Heights and
perfect<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:14.990> techniques<00:06:15.530> used<00:06:15.919> on<00:06:16.130> each

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
perfect the techniques used on each

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.090 
perfect the techniques used on each
different<00:06:16.850> part<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.330> the<00:06:17.450> grid<00:06:17.690> so<00:06:18.530> if<00:06:18.800> you<00:06:18.919> do

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
different part of the grid so if you do

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.159 
different part of the grid so if you do
this<00:06:19.310> you'll<00:06:19.640> find<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.150> any<00:06:20.390> given<00:06:20.630> rudiment

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
this you'll find that any given rudiment

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.920 
this you'll find that any given rudiment
will<00:06:21.410> actually<00:06:21.770> have<00:06:21.979> almost<00:06:22.570> three<00:06:23.570> or<00:06:23.600> more

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
will actually have almost three or more

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.570 
will actually have almost three or more
new

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580

rudiments<00:06:24.970> coming<00:06:25.240> out<00:06:25.389> of<00:06:25.539> it<00:06:25.659> just<00:06:25.960> because

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
rudiments coming out of it just because

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.540 
rudiments coming out of it just because
of<00:06:26.259> the<00:06:26.439> different<00:06:26.770> sounds<00:06:27.189> and<00:06:27.280> different

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
of the different sounds and different

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.399 
of the different sounds and different
ways<00:06:27.669> it<00:06:27.849> feels<00:06:28.090> and<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.840> challenge

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
ways it feels and the challenge

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:30.779 
ways it feels and the challenge
technically<00:06:29.919> to<00:06:30.039> get<00:06:30.189> through<00:06:30.370> these<00:06:30.520> things

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
technically to get through these things

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.969 
technically to get through these things
so<00:06:31.509> take<00:06:31.750> all<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:31.930> rudiments<00:06:32.409> you<00:06:32.500> know<00:06:32.680> and

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
so take all the rudiments you know and

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.879 
so take all the rudiments you know and
have<00:06:33.550> fun<00:06:33.729> with<00:06:33.879> the<00:06:34.000> grid<00:06:34.590> here's<00:06:35.590> a<00:06:35.650> bonus

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
grid a lot of flam rudiments you'll

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.050 
grid a lot of flam rudiments you'll
realize<00:06:48.159> that<00:06:48.189> you're<00:06:48.460> playing<00:06:48.699> a<00:06:48.849> lot<00:06:49.030> of

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
realize that you're playing a lot of

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.390 
realize that you're playing a lot of
accents<00:06:49.689> flam's<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.349> diddles<00:06:50.650> in<00:06:50.889> weird

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400

places<00:06:51.610> and<00:06:52.150> this<00:06:52.840> exercise<00:06:53.169> basically<00:06:53.650> puts

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
places and this exercise basically puts

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:55.980 
places and this exercise basically puts
them<00:06:54.219> all<00:06:54.310> together<00:06:54.460> in<00:06:54.909> a<00:06:55.180> really<00:06:55.419> scrambled

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
them all together in a really scrambled

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.649 
them all together in a really scrambled
up<00:06:56.080> weird<00:06:56.409> order<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:57.550> it's<00:06:57.940> one<00:06:58.150> of<00:06:58.240> those<00:06:58.330> it's

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
up weird order so it's one of those it's

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.180 
up weird order so it's one of those it's
a<00:06:58.870> challenge<00:06:59.319> and<00:06:59.440> if<00:06:59.530> you<00:06:59.620> can<00:06:59.740> play<00:06:59.949> this

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
a challenge and if you can play this

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.529 
a challenge and if you can play this
then<00:07:00.610> you're<00:07:00.759> probably<00:07:00.879> not<00:07:01.090> going<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.389> run

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
then you're probably not going to run

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:02.670 
then you're probably not going to run
into<00:07:01.659> many<00:07:01.810> flam<00:07:02.139> things<00:07:02.379> that<00:07:02.530> you're<00:07:02.650> not

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
into many flam things that you're not

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.830 
into many flam things that you're not
ready<00:07:02.979> for<00:07:03.219> so<00:07:03.879> I'll<00:07:04.060> give<00:07:04.210> it<00:07:04.300> a<00:07:04.389> shot<00:07:04.419> goes

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
ready for so I'll give it a shot goes

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:50.320 
ready for so I'll give it a shot goes
like<00:07:05.020> this
