00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.119
 so hello my name is kolganov 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.970
 Vitali today I will tell you about more 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.850
 one way to measure distance 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.940
 exhibiting distances correct when 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.970
 you are on concrete quays 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.089
 when you can not stick standard 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.550
 pegs to measure in principle already in 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.269
 the network has appeared all sorts of inventions 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.790
 there our craftsmen are very beautiful and 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.470
 competently and things make it right for 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.570
 platform there is something 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.629
 inventing an extra tube yet what 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.420
 then basically all the workers are all interesting 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.010
 but I think at long distances it is not 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.189
 very effective because very long 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:13.310
 need to exhaust the line then look all 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:19.119
 it takes time the other moment 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.680
 what people can roughly count and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.630
 set your distance already 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.360
 bad competitors may know your 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.210
 I won't offer you any distance 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.470
 the old way that still showed me 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.890
 my captain is ex 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.409
 still voronez in the twelfth year with 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.780
 using this setting 3 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.890
 legs 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.100
 stand under the rod as you want 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.540
 call in principle 3 a lot can be 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.370
 different because anyway on concrete 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.720
 the embankment will have to be put up either you 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.120
 get a float stand under 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.300
 whales but on nissan is suitable for these 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.450
 or many, I know already there are 3 such 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.269
 someone can buy himself legs 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.769
 it is probably better under embankments 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.239
 choose mesh 3 leg because she 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:17.680
 more versatile it can be used 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:21.769
 as a stand for measurement in principle 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.950
 that's what exactly 3 much more is needed for 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.459
 what is this way a little bit 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.500
 different from the way you do and 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.170
 fixed tubes there in meter length 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.599
 there or how much do we get a half 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.440
 people can roughly estimate and count 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.860
 before 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.010
 here we are using the command cord 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.930
 note the command everyone has there for example there 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.540
 maybe different 3 new but should be 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.090
 1 long cord well for example this is me 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.550
 did standard also pressure yanovskih 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.910
 three meters go to vskih 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.420
 pegs it can be made there 280 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.400
 Well, for example dow tied there so here 28 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.000
 made by eye you no longer decide 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.080
 that there are 28 of there yes or there are 270 and with 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 distances for example there are 30 turns in 270 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.370
 or 30 turns there are 250 or three meters 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.410
 it yourself you understand it is colossal 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:22.040
 the difference is why this is how I am at home 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.580
 more so let's say tricky for 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.070
 use at competitions more 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.250
 convenient to use at all on 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.490
 concrete on care 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.530
 Well, let's see how it works in principle 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.420
 there is no difference in working with pegs 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.959
 no , I still have to explain 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.180
 here as a platform on a platform me 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.120
 just now 36 foot 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.010
 i just put twenty five into it 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.920
 pipe as an adapter I'm basically here 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.010
 I use extra for delivery 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.080
 and its use as a measure of 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.890
 distances when i had twenty 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.959
 the fifth leg I just took extra 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.700
 from the umbrella now show you even 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.180
 subtlety did not take because the weather 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:14.239
 snow took this from an umbrella this one 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.609
 that and santa pulled put in just like that 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.609
 that's also a lot of 25 on the truth to 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:24.050
 perfect fit and i have the same 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.990
 stood and also everything is measured everything so 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.290
 let's say ingenious just 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:34.600
 the simpler it is and it's easier for you to work and that's it. 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.600
 it turns out faster so we look 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:51.390
 I am now at the moment three meters and here 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.620
 we expose the greater the distance between 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.170
 pegs easier to put less 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.450
 revolutions all this is done quickly when i 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:05.250
 there for example 10 turns will do there or 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:12.190
 15 to either 50 is injured i think big yes 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:15.550
 I now have a distance of 47 meters 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:24.280
 I should be there 15 half 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:29.610
 Well yes there is 15 by two-thirds, and now I have 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:38.550
 it turned out that I zaklipsovano 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:38.550
 look back 5 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.629
 hooked 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:06:03.930
 I got 15 and two thirds 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:05.729
 everything works freely everything goes and what 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.680
 the most important thing is that they are a competitor 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.559
 will be able to count because in any 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:16.169
 the moment I personally or my team as a whole 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:20.129
 we agreed there at home before 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.939
 fishing we set the example so much 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:26.009
 either in training we insert 280 and 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.469
 depending on this is mine just 28 10 we 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.870
 let's talk there are pegs up between 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:34.159
 naturally nobody will understand that 10 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:40.669
 pegs there you are not 30 meters about 25 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:43.199
 that's basically the easiest way and 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.219
 so let's say without it will be difficult 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.120
 do that you don't care 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:49.379
 will have to buy for concrete embankment 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.620
 either 3 leg or 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:55.860
 yes yes that's it but you floppy 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.599
 stand it is of course more sustainable 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:03.149
 but less practical by that 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:06.029
 feeder side of course set 

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:09.149
 rods on her she is more better but 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:10.499
 three-legged believe in principle and many 

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.180
 different manufacturers is that it is not 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:16.349
 press advertising then right now I'll start again 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.569
 that we are an advertiser it is just there 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:21.389
 that second flour is all 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.969
 manufacturers colmic myler absolutely 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:27.360
 any manufacturer has like 3 feet 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:30.120
 so the stands for the whales I just think 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.129
 that 3 is new for Fedor more profitable 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.729
 because we went to the chair 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:37.169
 set and water put a banana catch 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.509
 put a rod on it 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:41.449
 you need to compete somewhere else 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:44.520
 somewhere insert it behind you 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:48.190
 fasten the comb leave on 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.170
 his rod accordingly 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:54.180
 delivery under whales 

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.860
 the float has only one purpose 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.230
 just put there rods 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:04.090
 late i can supply our water but 

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:07.390
 This hemorrhoids already can of course all as 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.340
 it is said there is even a saying to this all 

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.680
 goodbye 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:14.130
 watch my china channel it will be a lot 

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.130
 what's interesting
