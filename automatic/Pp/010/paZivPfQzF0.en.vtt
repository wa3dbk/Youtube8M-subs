 as a doctor at jason per softie situation 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.119
 to explain 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.590
 the stream that flows through your body 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.540
 it's comparable to water in one 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.790
 cylinder is poured and of the one 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.560
 Part of this is running over the edge 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.570
 Overflowing water prevents it 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.090
 Unfortunately, serious injuries occur 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.649
 are eyes ears nose and mouth openings 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.579
 through the lightning in the body 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.480
 can occur 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.130
 and therein lies the danger in the body 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.719
 it gets to the heart in one 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.120
 cramp condition and stops 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.379
 the hit is young enough 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.629
 The heart will be in a few seconds 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.640
 continue to beat but the lightning strikes 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.129
 also the respiratory center in brain and the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.929
 breath lasts longer than that 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.879
 four or six minutes hear the heart 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.570
 strike again and then 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.570
 maybe forever 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.070
 none of the players has a direct 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.409
 lightning stroke suffered 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.200
 you can see that the lightning is behind 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.509
 the corner flag is going to be the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.619
 Earth thrown about 50 cm high and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.619
 smoke rises 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.950
 eight players are thrown to the ground 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.520
 when the lightning strikes three must from 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.810
 be worn one of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.120
 they spend a night in the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.230
 hospital but everyone is recovering 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.210
 luckily again 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.520
 It was twelve minutes before the end of the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.460
 Erstliga partie as the lightning with loud 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.110
 crackling on the field struck 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.150
 Six actors immediately brought together

 also the referee here on the top right 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.690
 in the picture or struck by lightning 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.540
 then played chaotic 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.430
 scenes because not a single paramedic 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.280
 in the stadium was the wallowing 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.140
 victims for several minutes on the lawn reporter 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.510
 the totally dazed players tried 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 to interview teammates 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.709
