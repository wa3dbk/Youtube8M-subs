you know i was i think i've said this
for<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:10.979> aim<00:02:11.160> high<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.459> might<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.879> quite

get it but you might
second<00:02:13.580> or<00:02:13.730> something<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.210> but

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
second or something like that but

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.870 
second or something like that but
honestly<00:02:15.410> think<00:02:15.650> we<00:02:15.740> can<00:02:15.920> still<00:02:16.610> win<00:02:16.730> it's
