ok<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.200> at<00:02:35.769> 3<00:02:36.219> we<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.700> many<00:02:37.319> variations

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
ok so at 3 we have the many variations

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.000 
ok so at 3 we have the many variations
of<00:02:38.889> the<00:02:39.129> Robosapien<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.870> Robo<00:02:41.109> Cepheid<00:02:41.590> media

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
of the Robosapien the Robo Cepheid media

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.009 
of the Robosapien the Robo Cepheid media
is<00:02:42.310> best<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.420> think<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.810> might<00:02:43.959> be

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
is best because I think you might be

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.929 
is best because I think you might be
able<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.230> pick<00:02:44.379> up<00:02:44.499> stuff<00:02:44.739> better<00:02:45.040> because<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
able to pick up stuff better because the

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.690 
able to pick up stuff better because the
regular<00:02:46.389> Robo<00:02:47.230> sepia<00:02:47.620> could<00:02:47.799> barely<00:02:48.280> pick<00:02:48.579> up

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
regular Robo sepia could barely pick up

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.699 
regular Robo sepia could barely pick up
the<00:02:48.849> cup<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.180> comes<00:02:49.359> with<00:02:49.599> it's<00:02:50.379> sort<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.620> like

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the cup it comes with it's sort of like

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.589 
the cup it comes with it's sort of like
that<00:02:50.889> game<00:02:51.099> of<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> machine<00:02:51.760> at<00:02:51.939> an<00:02:52.120> arcade

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
that game of the machine at an arcade

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.929 
that game of the machine at an arcade
where<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:53.109> barely<00:02:53.379> pick<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.650> up<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.670> yeah

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
where you can barely pick it up so yeah

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.929 
where you can barely pick it up so yeah
this<00:02:55.599> one<00:02:55.930> has<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.290> bunch<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.889> more<00:02:57.099> personality

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
this one has a bunch of more personality

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.209 
this one has a bunch of more personality
can<00:02:58.120> robe<00:02:58.560> too<00:02:59.560> so

can robe too so

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.879 
can robe too so
Edgard<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.030> that's<00:03:01.209> better<00:03:01.590> sort<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.769> the

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
Edgard so that's better sort of like the

Edgard so that's better sort of like the
robe<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.189> and<00:03:03.639> the<00:03:04.060> Robosapien<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.049> MIT

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
robe of the and the Robosapien and MIT

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.819 
robe of the and the Robosapien and MIT
combined<00:03:06.219> so<00:03:06.639> pretty<00:03:06.909> cool<00:03:07.120> about<00:03:07.829> $79<00:03:10.769> ok<00:03:11.769> so

ok<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.489> what<00:03:49.000> one<00:03:49.419> we<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:50.049> nip<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.829> have<00:03:51.489> a

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
ok so what one we have nip I have a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.699 
ok so what one we have nip I have a
picture<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.449> yellow<00:03:52.959> or<00:03:53.079> green<00:03:53.470> one<00:03:53.680> a

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
picture of a yellow or green one a

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.920 
picture of a yellow or green one a
pretty<00:03:54.069> rare<00:03:54.340> color<00:03:54.699> I<00:03:55.000> think<00:03:55.209> this<00:03:55.659> is<00:03:55.900> a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
pretty rare color I think this is a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.159 
pretty rare color I think this is a
variation<00:03:56.530> for<00:03:56.979> the<00:03:57.129> creators<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:58.720> one<00:03:58.930> can

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
variation for the creators this one can

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.890 
variation for the creators this one can
balance<00:03:59.680> like<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.069> trip<00:04:00.489> stir<00:04:00.699> it<00:04:00.849> can<00:04:01.060> roam

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
balance like the trip stir it can roam

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.800 
balance like the trip stir it can roam
around<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.560> can<00:04:02.799> dance<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.790> can<00:04:03.970> talk<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.599> can
