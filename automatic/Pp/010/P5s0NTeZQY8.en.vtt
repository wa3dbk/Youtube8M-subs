 the most for this Sunday day 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 look at the satellite animation that we 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.019
 shows the disturbance arrived yesterday 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 this long cloudy scarf that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.619
 continues to feed us in conditions 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.210
 disturbed and rainy and this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.920
 disturbance will find her this after 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.390

 with rainfall locally 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 supported and these heavy rains associated 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 at the snow melt may generate 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.539
 overflows of watercourses and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
