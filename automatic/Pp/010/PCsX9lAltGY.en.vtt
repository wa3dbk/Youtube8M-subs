00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
but this three hidden trap door using

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.010 
but this three hidden trap door using
distance<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:30.599> way<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.840> works<00:00:31.520> is<00:00:32.520> not

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
distance and the way it works is not

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.190 
distance and the way it works is not
simple<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.550> gotta<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.140> yeah<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
simple you gotta have some yeah you

simple you gotta have some yeah you
can't<00:00:37.530> make<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.770> by<00:00:37.920> yourself<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.640> gotta

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
can't make it by yourself but you gotta

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
can't make it by yourself but you gotta
have<00:00:39.090> some<00:00:39.300> experience<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.129> with<00:00:41.129> these

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
have some experience with it with these

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
have some experience with it with these
torches<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.850> stuff<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.450> course<00:00:42.480> use

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
torches and stuff you can of course use

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.639 
torches and stuff you can of course use
a<00:00:42.930> piston<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> block<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
a piston down here to get a block with a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
a piston down here to get a block with a
torch<00:00:46.980> right<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> if

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
torch right here but it like this so if

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.889 
torch right here but it like this so if
you<00:00:51.510> want<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.629> George

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you want this just like here with George

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.500 
you want this just like here with George
allow<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> same<00:00:55.829> world

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
allow it on the same world

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.500 
allow it on the same world
you've<00:00:57.510> got<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> power<00:00:58.020> dis<00:00:58.410> lock<00:00:59.149> to<00:01:00.149> turn<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you've got a power dis lock to turn it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.139 
you've got a power dis lock to turn it
off<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> they're<00:01:01.140> attractive<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> if

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
off and they're attractive but if you if

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.380 
off and they're attractive but if you if
this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> still<00:01:03.930> powered<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.790> retracted

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this is still powered what is retracted

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.820 
this is still powered what is retracted
then<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.960> piston<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.770> turn<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.830> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
then this piston will turn on and you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.649 
then this piston will turn on and you
don't<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.000> give<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
don't want that so you give it like a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.340 
don't want that so you give it like a
three<00:01:13.110> tick<00:01:13.320> pulse<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.210> retract<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
three tick pulse so will retract this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460 
three tick pulse so will retract this
turns<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.890> again<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.990> blocks<00:01:19.229> no

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
turns on again and it's the blocks no

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.950 
turns on again and it's the blocks no
longer<00:01:19.770> powered<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.880> not<00:01:21.060> give<00:01:21.780> any

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
longer powered so this will not give any

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.219 
longer powered so this will not give any
pulses<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.619> something<00:01:23.420> move<00:01:24.420> those<00:01:24.630> blocks<00:01:24.990> up

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pulses or something move those blocks up

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
pulses or something move those blocks up
and<00:01:27.770> for<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.829> middle<00:01:29.040> part<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:30.200> have<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:33.000> Box

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and for the middle part I have the Box

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.649 
and for the middle part I have the Box
in<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.900> extends<00:01:34.560> two<00:01:34.829> blocks<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:36.420> here

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
in here that extends two blocks to here

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
in here that extends two blocks to here
and<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.939> happens<00:01:38.939> after<00:01:40.549> your<00:01:41.549> kisses<00:01:42.000> right

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and that happens after your kisses right

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.670 
and that happens after your kisses right
here<00:01:42.530> come<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.770> place<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.530> would

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
here come in this place so they would

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.580 
here come in this place so they would
they<00:01:46.799> will<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.040> powered<00:01:47.490> by<00:01:47.520> torches<00:01:48.590> allowing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
they will be powered by torches allowing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340 
they will be powered by torches allowing
these<00:01:49.770> blocks<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.780> attracting

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
these blocks and then for attracting

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.490 
these blocks and then for attracting
these<00:01:53.100> blocks<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.390> away<00:01:54.570> first<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
these blocks have to go away first and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.459 
these blocks have to go away first and
then<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.579> got<00:01:56.850> retracted<00:01:57.770> up<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.250> and

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
then these got retracted up to here and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
then these got retracted up to here and
I'm<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.619> sure<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.490> show<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.360 

so<00:02:11.080> let's<00:02:11.410> close<00:02:16.230> later<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.650> goes<00:02:17.890> again<00:02:18.160> as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
so let's close later this goes again as

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.760 
so let's close later this goes again as
you<00:02:18.490> see<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.780> takes<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.350> little<00:02:23.500> bit<00:02:23.710> more

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
you see so that takes a little bit more

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.820 
you see so that takes a little bit more
time<00:02:24.310> then<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.960> example<00:02:26.020> it's<00:02:26.560> three<00:02:26.710> by

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
time then for example it's three by

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.760 
time then for example it's three by
three<00:02:27.330> vertical<00:02:28.350> hidden<00:02:29.350> door<00:02:31.500> I've<00:02:32.500> also

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
three vertical hidden door I've also

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.310 
three vertical hidden door I've also
made<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.070> tree<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.460> tree<00:02:33.780> he<00:02:34.780> didn't<00:02:35.080> see<00:02:35.260> this

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
made a tree a tree he didn't see this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.030 
made a tree a tree he didn't see this
piston<00:02:35.740> or<00:02:35.920> some<00:02:36.580> time<00:02:36.820> ago<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:38.590> will<00:02:38.770> also

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
piston or some time ago and I will also

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.310 
piston or some time ago and I will also
do<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> video<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:40.870> was<00:02:41.080> more

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
do a video on that but this was more

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.850 
do a video on that but this was more
special<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.100> did<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.460> first<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.590> hope

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
special so I did this first so I hope
