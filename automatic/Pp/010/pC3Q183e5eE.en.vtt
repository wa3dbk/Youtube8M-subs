artificial intelligence for robots and
what<00:00:21.150> they've<00:00:21.270> done<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.720> this

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
what they've done is they have this

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.410 
what they've done is they have this

with<00:00:24.510> people<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.740> memorize<00:00:26.869> record<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
with people and they memorize record and

thousands of hours of conversation and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.410 
thousands of hours of conversation and
the<00:00:32.399> longer<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> more

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the longer they do it the more

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.720 
the longer they do it the more
human-like<00:00:33.870> their<00:00:34.200> responses<00:00:34.829> become<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
human-like their responses become so you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.190 
human-like their responses become so you
can<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> conversation<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.050> sit

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
can actually have a conversation and sit

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.930 
can actually have a conversation and sit
down<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> talk<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.829> robot<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> he<00:00:38.670> can

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
down and talk to a robot and he can

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.340 
down and talk to a robot and he can
understand<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.260> talking

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
understand what it is you're talking

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
understand what it is you're talking
about<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.829> answer<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.100> back<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.030> they

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
about and answer you back right so they

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.830 
about and answer you back right so they
thought<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.719> interesting

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
thought it would be an interesting

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840 
thought it would be an interesting
experiment<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:43.829> two<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.430> robots

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
experiment to take two of these robots

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
experiment to take two of these robots
program<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.140> them<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> say<00:00:46.500> hi<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
program one of them to say hi to the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.889 
program one of them to say hi to the
other<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.030> let<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.480> robots

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
other and then just let the two robots

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.209 
other and then just let the two robots
go<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.500> their<00:00:49.710> own<00:00:49.890> conversation

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
go off and have their own conversation

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
go off and have their own conversation
with<00:00:50.730> no<00:00:50.879> further<00:00:51.210> human<00:00:51.480> interaction<00:00:51.960> am<00:00:52.140> i

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
with no further human interaction am i

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
with no further human interaction am i
explaining<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> sufficiently<00:00:53.399> yes<00:00:53.789> no

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
explaining this sufficiently yes no

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.660 
explaining this sufficiently yes no
sorry<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.840> happened

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
sorry what happened

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.099 
sorry what happened
so<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.120> two<00:00:57.149> robots<00:00:57.750> who<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.989> been

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so here are two robots who have been

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.560 
so here are two robots who have been
given<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> voices<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> man<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.210> woman

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
given the voices of a man and a woman

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
given the voices of a man and a woman
having<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.079> conversation<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.980> scratch

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
having a conversation from scratch

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
having a conversation from scratch
started<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.329> hi<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
started with just hi and I think it's so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
interesting to see where these guys go

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.330 
interesting to see where these guys go
based<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> input<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> thousands<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.159> hours

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
based on the input of thousands of hours

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.190 
based on the input of thousands of hours
of<00:01:08.369> conversation<00:01:08.939> listen<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:10.610> how<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
of conversation listen up how are you

these<00:01:37.470> programs<00:01:38.040> talk<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.729> thousands<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
these programs talk to thousands of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
these programs talk to thousands of
people<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.409> an<00:01:40.500> input<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
people you know I think it's an input of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
people you know I think it's an input of
you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.280> everybody<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.119> speak<00:01:42.360> with

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you know everybody that they speak with

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.910 
you know everybody that they speak with
but<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> interesting<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> turn

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
but it is interesting to see the turn

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
but it is interesting to see the turn
that<00:01:44.100> again<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.640> no<00:01:44.820> further<00:01:45.210> human

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that again with no further human

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.760 
that again with no further human
interaction<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.170> interesting<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.619> see

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
interaction it's interesting to see

to<00:02:33.709> go<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.130> were<00:02:34.220> talking<00:02:34.340> about<00:02:34.520> this

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
to go but we were talking about this

yesterday<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.150> mean<00:02:35.270> we're<00:02:35.690> we're<00:02:36.080> very<00:02:36.380> close

yesterday I mean we're we're very close

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.199 
yesterday I mean we're we're very close
to<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> point<00:02:37.160> where<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.580> can<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:37.970> little

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
to the point where you can have little

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.310 
to the point where you can have little
robots<00:02:38.540> who<00:02:38.690> are<00:02:38.780> running<00:02:38.900> around<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.230> your

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
robots who are running around in your

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.050 
robots who are running around in your
house<00:02:39.500> or<00:02:39.709> something<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.340> can<00:02:40.550> tell<00:02:40.880> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
house or something that you can tell to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.220 
house or something that you can tell to
do<00:02:41.180> something<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.660> they<00:02:41.750> will<00:02:41.900> do<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.170> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
do something and they will do it and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.300 
do something and they will do it and
they<00:02:42.320> will<00:02:42.410> understand<00:02:42.890> they<00:02:43.040> will<00:02:43.130> answer

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
they will understand they will answer

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.680 
they will understand they will answer
back<00:02:43.550> but<00:02:43.700> I'm<00:02:43.910> gonna<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> conversation

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
back but I'm gonna have a conversation

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.550 
back but I'm gonna have a conversation
with<00:02:45.320> them<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.870> we've<00:02:47.990> still<00:02:48.170> got<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.320> ways<00:02:48.530> to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
with them that we've still got a ways to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.770 
with them that we've still got a ways to
go<00:02:49.070> but<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.340> think<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> beginning<00:02:50.600> of

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
go but I think this is the beginning of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.630 
go but I think this is the beginning of
substitute<00:02:51.590> people<00:02:51.890> which<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:52.490> I've

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
substitute people which is what I've

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.430 
substitute people which is what I've
been<00:02:52.820> hoping<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.240> everyone<00:02:53.840> if<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.350> were

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
been hoping for everyone if you were

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.199 
been hoping for everyone if you were
real<00:02:54.680> fewer<00:02:55.130> real<00:02:55.459> people<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.060> more

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
real fewer real people and more

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.210 
real fewer real people and more
substitute<00:02:56.750> people<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.140> love<00:02:57.680> where<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.010> is

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
substitute people I love where this is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.380 
substitute people I love where this is
going<00:02:58.459> that's<00:02:58.610> all<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:58.880> saying<00:02:59.150> well<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.270> think

going that's all I'm saying well I think

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.360 
going that's all I'm saying well I think
we've<00:03:00.380> been<00:03:00.410> able<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.769> communicate<00:03:01.040> with

fascinates<00:03:08.360> me<00:03:08.450> about<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.780> story<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.110> that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
fascinates me about this story is that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.170 
fascinates me about this story is that
the<00:03:09.410> two<00:03:09.590> robots<00:03:09.860> are<00:03:10.250> interacting<00:03:10.910> with<00:03:11.030> each

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
the two robots are interacting with each

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.150 
the two robots are interacting with each
other<00:03:11.450> they<00:03:11.900> don't<00:03:12.080> even<00:03:12.170> need<00:03:12.440> humans<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.040> be

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
other they don't even need humans to be

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.650 
other they don't even need humans to be
in<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> middle<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.880> deal<00:03:14.060> they<00:03:14.360> are<00:03:14.390> able

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
in the middle of the deal they are able

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.210 
in the middle of the deal they are able
to<00:03:14.810> communicate<00:03:15.170> with<00:03:15.440> each<00:03:15.470> other<00:03:15.680> that

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
to communicate with each other that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.790 
to communicate with each other that
poorly<00:03:16.790> but<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.600> transfer<00:03:18.110> information<00:03:18.320> back

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
poorly but to transfer information back

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.009 
poorly but to transfer information back
and<00:03:18.950> forth<00:03:19.130> between<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.730> come<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.239> robots<00:03:20.720> I

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
and forth between to come to robots I

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.050 
and forth between to come to robots I
think<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.650> interesting<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:22.940> were

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
think is interesting and what we were

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.250 
think is interesting and what we were
inspired<00:03:23.480> here<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.780> show<00:03:23.930> when<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.140> guys

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
inspired here in the show when you guys
