gotta do something to feel some type of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.100 
gotta do something to feel some type of
dominance<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.820> that's<00:02:28.330> what<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.570> ended<00:02:29.020> up

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
dominance and that's what I ended up

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.670 
dominance and that's what I ended up
doing<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.740> drop<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:31.290> actually<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.560> in

doing I drop it in I actually get in

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.110 
doing I drop it in I actually get in
team<00:02:32.890> assault<00:02:33.220> which<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.490> actually<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:34.000> of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
team assault which is actually kind of

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.330 
team assault which is actually kind of
rare<00:02:34.330> because<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:35.080> think<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.220> lot

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
rare because I think that it's a lot

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.870 
rare because I think that it's a lot
easier<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.940> get<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.380> high<00:02:38.740> score<00:02:39.670> chain

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
easier to get you know high score chain

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.880 
easier to get you know high score chain

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
rewards in objective game modes because

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.040 
rewards in objective game modes because
