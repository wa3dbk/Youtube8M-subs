it<00:00:38.550> when<00:00:38.700> you're<00:00:38.820> changing<00:00:39.030> gear<00:00:39.420> tells<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it when you're changing gear tells it to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.090

put them in that nice thing then

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.800 
put them in that nice thing then
immediately<00:04:04.459> took<00:04:04.819> them<00:04:04.940> out<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.299> touched<00:04:05.659> him

to the new world see instructions which

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.640 
to the new world see instructions which
you<00:04:08.299> can't<00:04:08.540> see<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.840> phone's<00:04:09.049> too<00:04:09.230> bright<00:04:09.470> on

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
you can't see the phone's too bright on

you can't see the phone's too bright on
Olivia<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.450> yes<00:04:11.599> it<00:04:11.720> tells<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.019> there<00:04:12.230> which

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
Olivia so yes it tells you there which

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.029 
Olivia so yes it tells you there which
way<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:13.209> try<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.239> line<00:04:14.510> everything<00:04:14.690> up<00:04:15.039> yeah

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
way to try to line everything up yeah

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.979 
way to try to line everything up yeah
she's<00:04:16.850> quite<00:04:17.000> happy<00:04:17.269> here<00:04:17.389> starting<00:04:17.930> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
she's quite happy here starting to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.390 
she's quite happy here starting to
confused<00:04:18.350> there's<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.590> ruler<00:04:18.949> because<00:04:19.280> it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
confused there's a ruler because it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.129 
confused there's a ruler because it
tells<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.699> exactly<00:04:20.239> how<00:04:20.539> many<00:04:20.840> millimeters

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
tells you exactly how many millimeters

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.800 
tells you exactly how many millimeters
the<00:04:21.560> nearest<00:04:21.769> half<00:04:21.919> millimeter<00:04:22.810> of

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
the nearest half millimeter of

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.330 
the nearest half millimeter of
everything<00:04:24.229> apart<00:04:24.560> which<00:04:24.889> was<00:04:25.039> fairly<00:04:25.220> easy

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
everything apart which was fairly easy

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.520 
everything apart which was fairly easy
to<00:04:25.520> do<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:26.600> think<00:04:26.750> it'd<00:04:26.840> be<00:04:26.870> impossible<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.440> get

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
to do to think it'd be impossible to get

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.290 
to do to think it'd be impossible to get
himself<00:04:27.830> better<00:04:28.250> be<00:04:28.370> really<00:04:28.520> pretty<00:04:28.729> isn't<00:04:28.910> it

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
himself better be really pretty isn't it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.450 
himself better be really pretty isn't it
so<00:04:29.620> just<00:04:30.620> twist<00:04:30.889> them<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.160> right<00:04:31.280> mouth

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
so just twist them to the right mouth

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.330 
so just twist them to the right mouth
turns<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.000> gets<00:04:32.210> there<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:33.100> that's<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.220> in

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
turns and it gets there so that's it in

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.490 
turns and it gets there so that's it in
place<00:04:34.639> not<00:04:35.419> too<00:04:35.600> hard<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.930> get<00:04:36.050> back<00:04:36.169> home<00:04:36.320> it's

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
place not too hard to get back home it's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.920 
place not too hard to get back home it's
got<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> Clips<00:04:36.949> back<00:04:37.160> on<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.610> he<00:04:37.699> with<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.630> little

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
got a Clips back on and he with a little

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.750 
got a Clips back on and he with a little
got<00:04:39.380> activity<00:04:39.770> things<00:04:39.979> which<00:04:40.190> presumably<00:04:40.550> you

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
got activity things which presumably you

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.820 
got activity things which presumably you
push<00:04:41.419> stuff<00:04:41.660> about<00:04:41.900> like<00:04:42.139> poking<00:04:42.560> did<00:04:42.650> little

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
push stuff about like poking did little

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.279 
push stuff about like poking did little
holes<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.250> into<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.490> ball<00:04:43.639> joints<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.289> click

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
holes and into the ball joints and click

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.560 
holes and into the ball joints and click
around<00:04:45.470> their<00:04:45.710> back<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.490> thing<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.789> can<00:04:46.940> do<00:04:47.449> all

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
around their back the thing I can do all

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.050 
around their back the thing I can do all
that<00:04:47.660> with<00:04:47.720> your<00:04:47.900> fingers<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:48.820> come<00:04:49.820> people

where<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.849> which<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.570> thread<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:56.810> it

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
where to which is the thread that it

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.360 
where to which is the thread that it
comes<00:04:57.349> up<00:04:57.470> through<00:04:57.740> some<00:04:57.979> part<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.310> the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
comes up through some part of the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.950 
comes up through some part of the
chassis<00:04:58.639> now

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
chassis now

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.830 
chassis now
through<00:05:00.620> there<00:05:01.120> between<00:05:02.120> some<00:05:02.630> kind<00:05:02.810> of

bulkhead he beaten of the swingarm and
her<00:05:06.009> another<00:05:07.009> bit<00:05:07.250> goes<00:05:07.520> through<00:05:07.699> there<00:05:07.880> I

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
her another bit goes through there I

her another bit goes through there I
don't<00:05:10.160> if<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.310> can<00:05:10.430> see<00:05:10.610> which<00:05:10.729> bit<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.060> is

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
don't if you can see which bit that is

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.180 
don't if you can see which bit that is
hurdles<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.600> we<00:05:11.780> got<00:05:12.139> dangling<00:05:12.650> maneuvering

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
hurdles that we got dangling maneuvering

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.560 
hurdles that we got dangling maneuvering
about<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.610> can't<00:05:13.850> tell<00:05:14.060> which<00:05:14.150> bit<00:05:14.330> it<00:05:14.449> is

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
about so you can't tell which bit it is

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.200 
about so you can't tell which bit it is
so<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.949> comes<00:05:16.100> up<00:05:16.190> through<00:05:16.310> there<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.150> you

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
so that comes up through there and you

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.150 
so that comes up through there and you
do<00:05:17.449> some<00:05:17.570> cable<00:05:17.900> tying<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.680> gave<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.889> up<00:05:18.949> cable

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
do some cable tying we gave it up cable

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.920 
do some cable tying we gave it up cable
tying<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.729> attached<00:05:20.210> to<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.449> loop<00:05:20.630> there<00:05:20.870> in
