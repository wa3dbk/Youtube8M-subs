00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
show off the colors underneath
especially<00:01:37.470> those<00:01:37.650> chests<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.610> gonna<00:01:38.790> be

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
especially those chests that's gonna be

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880 
especially those chests that's gonna be
very<00:01:39.329> impressive<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
very impressive when you put in all the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.730 
very impressive when you put in all the
small<00:01:41.070> colored<00:01:41.430> parts<00:01:41.790> inside<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.560> even<00:01:43.560> more

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
small colored parts inside and even more

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
small colored parts inside and even more
so<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> C<00:01:44.880> plate<00:01:45.149> disappointing

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
so here with the C plate disappointing

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
so here with the C plate disappointing
because<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> lack<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.860> interest<00:01:47.340> they're

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
because of the lack of interest they're

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.090 
because of the lack of interest they're
in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.090> generic<00:01:48.659> Londo<00:01:49.200> Bell<00:01:49.380> pilots<00:01:49.890> there

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
in the generic Londo Bell pilots there

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.639 
in the generic Londo Bell pilots there
you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> beam<00:01:51.450> saber<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.140> but

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you can see the beam saber up there but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.899 
you can see the beam saber up there but
otherwise<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.189> gonna<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.399> these<00:01:53.610> small

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
otherwise it's gonna be these small

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.520 
otherwise it's gonna be these small
parts<00:01:54.240> where<00:01:54.420> again<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.960> long<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> cut

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
parts where again as long as you cut

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
parts where again as long as you cut
parts<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.189> expose<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.790> colors

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
parts out and expose more colors

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.179 
parts out and expose more colors
underneath<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:58.049> always<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> plus

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
underneath it's always gonna be a plus

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.520 
underneath it's always gonna be a plus
as<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.360> elbow<00:02:00.659> bends<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
as you can see the elbow bends there and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.959 
as you can see the elbow bends there and
the<00:02:01.770> legs<00:02:01.979> which<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.430> supposed<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> be

when it gets the big gun in the future
you<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.360> see<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> inner<00:02:15.750> frame<00:02:16.020> that's<00:02:16.230> gonna

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
you can see the inner frame that's gonna

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.440 
you can see the inner frame that's gonna
be<00:02:16.500> nicely<00:02:16.890> detailed<00:02:17.130> therefore<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.970> insides

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the plate is the kind of thing that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870 
the plate is the kind of thing that
would<00:02:42.810> probably<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:43.410> oh<00:02:43.590> middle<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> cannon

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
would probably be oh middle for a cannon

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.820 
would probably be oh middle for a cannon
there<00:02:45.230> disappointing<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.560> hand

the way skirts are just gonna be

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.800 
the way skirts are just gonna be
attached<00:02:50.370> together<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.150> suppose<00:02:51.660> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
attached together there I suppose you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.030 
attached together there I suppose you
could<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.080> separate<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:52.770> they<00:02:52.830> probably

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
could go separate them but they probably

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.670 
could go separate them but they probably
won't<00:02:53.340> stick<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.510> well<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.110> maybe

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
won't stick on all that well and maybe

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.199 
won't stick on all that well and maybe
they<00:02:55.800> would<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.160> worth<00:02:56.280> checking<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.820> after

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
they would and worth checking out after

they would and worth checking out after
here<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.080> see<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> beam<00:02:58.500> rifle<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:58.890> gonna

here you can see the beam rifle is gonna

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.650 
here you can see the beam rifle is gonna
be<00:02:59.160> looking<00:02:59.430> good<00:02:59.489> with<00:02:59.790> some<00:02:59.970> good<00:03:00.209> painting

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
all the halves together there and you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.630 
all the halves together there and you
can<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:07.709> some<00:03:07.890> other<00:03:07.950> parts<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.520> the
