00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to everyone who is watching this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.480
 video I'm boxer janer and this is the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.880
 fifth part of curiosities not 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.070
 mentioned megaman I do not have many 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.150
 want to do an introduction so 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.150
 go straight to the video 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.360
 we know that the closest scene of 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.180
 megaman killing wild is at the end of 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.700
 megaman 7 but there is another occasion where 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.980
 we can kill him and that's in mega man 4 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.160
 right after the first fight against 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.160
 the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 the weirdest thing about this is that for this 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.460
 pass the programmers must have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 configured to willy as an enemy 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.470
 destructible thing that is completely 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 unnecessary in addition to doing this not 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.879
 we can move to the final level thing that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 neither does it make sense since it is supposed 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 that we must pass level when 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 we beat the boss but it seems that this 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.379
 particular level is programmed to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 that we advance after whale and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.070
 escape and by not letting it escape is not 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.070
 possible to continue the game 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.720
 megaman eight and a half sea both have 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.030
 many similarities both have the same 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 graphic quality several sprites are 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.380
 The same both have a star mania ten 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 woman but there is something else they have in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 common and at the same time is very rare I 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 I mean clown man and magic man I do not know 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.490
 they look very similar from a distance but they have 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 many things in common so many in fact 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.440
 that seems purposefully at first the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 level of the two take place in a circus 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.050
 and both are based on works of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.539
 circus a clown and a magician not only that of 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.880
 all the master robots these are the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.940
 only they based on work and not on 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.830
 animal objects or adjectives both 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.370
 levels have enemies and objects 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.550
 same as trains 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.930
 the little soldiers 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.520
 the platforms 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.070
 the Pirates 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.340
 and that toy in the background that hits a 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.009
 bell activating something of the level 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 even that giant coin with face 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.250
 Lion 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.470
 the music of both levels have that 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.470
 circus style 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.040
 and the weirdest of all are both defeated 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.140
 by the wind weapon but not any 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.620
 wind weapon but that is the weapon of 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.620
 'I have man 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 to finish this video I will dedicate 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.080
 the last curiosity to a user who 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.770
 He left his comment in the first video of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.770
 curiosities 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.180
 although it has never been said in 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.370
 the megaman games that be or have 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.459
 been created by while and references 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.770
 they are very clear it is perfectly known that 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.750
 to be or is the greatest creation of wylie but 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.370
 what you do not know are your actions with 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.610
 regarding the history of megaman 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.280
 classic something interesting happens in the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.280
 introduction of 0 in mega man x 4 when 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.610
 while and says 0 after him 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.239
 he is my nemesis our rival is what 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.520
 It gives me motivation in my life now go 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.110
 destroy what is an order you notice that 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.570
 while and zeroed the order of 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.850
 destroy mega man is supposed to me 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.190
 they call x is made from mega man 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.800
 and the odd thing is that we do not know how 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.200
 is that it goes got into this happen all 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.750
 the megaman games always tried 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.090
 prove that it was the strongest robot what 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.100
 most likely, seeing the incredible 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 zero base power has outraged and 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.810
 faced zero to prove to be 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.030
 superior and if we compare the power of 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.040
 baseline of zero we can say that abbas no 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.840
 he did very well in the fight and out 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.269
 beaten together with mega man 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.640
 the doctor like sure he noticed what 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.980
 dangerous that it was so I think a x 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.080
 joining the megaman base systems 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.420
 to be a rival within reach of zero 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.040
 another curious thing is that in the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.989
 introduction of megaman x 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 we can read in the doctor's message 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.910
 light that x is the first robot with the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.609
 ability to think and feel and take their 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.799
 own decisions that would have to be 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.650
 zero if it was not because I had a virus that 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.970
 he controlled his actions that was all 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.970
 comment and rate chau
