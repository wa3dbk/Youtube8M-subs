you're gonna have to do is find out what
firmware<00:01:01.890> version<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.399> cameras<00:01:02.760> running

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
firmware version your cameras running

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
firmware version your cameras running
you<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> by<00:01:04.019> holding<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> shutter

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you do this by holding down the shutter

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
you do this by holding down the shutter
button<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> display<00:01:05.909> button<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> same

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
button in the display button at the same

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
button in the display button at the same
time<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.590> hitting<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> button

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
time and then hitting the on button

time and then hitting the on button
it'll<00:01:09.630> come<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> LCD<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.799> firmware

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it'll come up on the LCD what firmware

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.850 
it'll come up on the LCD what firmware
version<00:01:11.490> you're<00:01:11.640> using<00:01:11.880> ours<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.049> using<00:01:13.320> 65

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
version you're using ours was using 65

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039

50<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.689> based<00:01:15.900> off

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
50 and that's what all this is based off

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.609 
50 and that's what all this is based off
of<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.530> running<00:01:16.650> 65<00:01:17.280> 20<00:01:18.320> you're<00:01:19.320> lucky

because that's a lot easier okay now
they<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> firmware<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> can

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
they know what the firmware is you can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
they know what the firmware is you can
go<00:01:22.950> ahead<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.340> disassemble<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> camera

marker<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.159> use<00:02:30.730> your<00:02:30.879> Dremel<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.360> cut<00:02:31.510> out

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
marker on it use your Dremel and cut out

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.180 
marker on it use your Dremel and cut out
a<00:02:31.659> hole<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.379> way<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.620> nice<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.069> tucked

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
a hole so that way it's nice and tucked

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.039 
a hole so that way it's nice and tucked
away<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.579> doesn't<00:02:33.760> look<00:02:34.000> bad<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.450> you've<00:02:34.900> got

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
away it doesn't look bad and you've got

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.470 
away it doesn't look bad and you've got
easy<00:02:35.230> access<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:36.430> there<00:02:36.700> go<00:02:36.940> ahead<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.329> take

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
easy access from there go ahead and take

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.690 
easy access from there go ahead and take
the<00:02:37.629> board<00:02:37.900> mount<00:02:38.379> it<00:02:38.530> back<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.280> half<00:02:39.549> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the board mount it back to one half of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.460 
the board mount it back to one half of
the<00:02:39.819> cover<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.690> still<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.049> access<00:02:41.230> to

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the cover so you still have access to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.890 
the cover so you still have access to
the<00:02:41.590> back<00:02:41.829> panel<00:02:42.099> snug<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:42.909> because<00:02:43.659> now

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the back panel snug it up because now

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.240 
the back panel snug it up because now
we're<00:02:44.019> going<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.170> move<00:02:44.319> on<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.500> software<00:02:45.040> and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
we're going to move on to software and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.819 
we're going to move on to software and
we<00:02:45.340> still<00:02:45.579> need<00:02:45.730> access<00:02:45.909> to<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.480> board<00:02:46.829> okay

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
we still need access to that board okay

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.199 
we still need access to that board okay
so<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.190> we<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.519> go<00:02:48.640> ahead<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.000> start

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
so now we can go ahead and start

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.509 
so now we can go ahead and start
