00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
they did the old cards both on the gate

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.850 
they did the old cards both on the gate
cards<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.449> can<00:04:57.570> clearly<00:04:57.930> see<00:04:58.229> what<00:04:58.440> gate<00:04:58.620> card

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
cards you can clearly see what gate card

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.439 
cards you can clearly see what gate card
it<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.100> for<00:04:59.310> all<00:04:59.340> eyes<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.699> see<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.360> can

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
it is for all eyes to see and you can

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.300 
it is for all eyes to see and you can
see<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.780> size<00:05:01.050> of<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.320> attribute<00:05:01.800> bonuses

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
see the size of the attribute bonuses

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.070 
see the size of the attribute bonuses
now<00:05:02.460> they're<00:05:02.970> much<00:05:03.120> clearer<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.690> easier<00:05:03.840> to

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
now they're much clearer and easier to

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.040 
now they're much clearer and easier to
read<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.699> cards<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.240> Prince<00:05:06.539> easier<00:05:06.960> to

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
read on the cards the Prince easier to

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.659 
read on the cards the Prince easier to
read<00:05:07.260> so<00:05:07.530> they<00:05:07.800> kind<00:05:08.039> of<00:05:08.100> stepped<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.460> little

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
read so they kind of stepped a little

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.790 
read so they kind of stepped a little
bit<00:05:08.789> backward<00:05:09.210> they<00:05:09.360> shrunk<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.320> size<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.710> the

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
bit backward they shrunk the size of the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.710 
bit backward they shrunk the size of the
frame<00:05:10.919> on<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.310> cards<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:12.090> back<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.360> still

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
frame on the cards the back is still

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.540 
frame on the cards the back is still
unchanged<00:05:13.260> but<00:05:13.380> they<00:05:13.530> shunt<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.070> trunk<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
unchanged but they shunt the trunk the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.310 
unchanged but they shunt the trunk the
size<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:14.970> frame<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.479> I<00:05:15.960> don't<00:05:16.139> know<00:05:16.199> if
