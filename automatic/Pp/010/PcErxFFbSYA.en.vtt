much<00:03:27.860> ignore<00:03:28.460> because<00:03:28.700> I'll<00:03:29.390> most<00:03:29.660> likely<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
much ignore because I'll most likely to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.310 
much ignore because I'll most likely to
go<00:03:30.200> after<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.710> with<00:03:30.980> them<00:03:32.050> whatever<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.170> can

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
go after you with them whatever you can

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:47.870 
go after you with them whatever you can
see<00:03:33.530> with

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.280 

for<00:03:48.880> some<00:03:49.000> reason<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.540> thought<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.080> when<00:03:50.260> I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
for some reason I thought that when I

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.010 
for some reason I thought that when I
hit<00:03:50.470> one<00:03:50.709> minute<00:03:51.099> left<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.700> would<00:03:52.090> get<00:03:52.660> four

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
hit one minute left it would get four

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.410 
hit one minute left it would get four
stars<00:03:53.349> and<00:03:53.560> authority<00:03:53.980> but<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.730> doesn't

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
stars and authority but it doesn't

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.640 
stars and authority but it doesn't
actually<00:03:55.569> I<00:03:56.849> guess<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:58.030> like<00:03:58.209> 30<00:03:58.930> no<00:03:59.170> at<00:03:59.319> 30

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
actually I guess that like 30 no at 30

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.500 
actually I guess that like 30 no at 30
seconds<00:04:00.220> left<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.610> gives<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.880> four<00:04:01.120> starters

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
seconds left it gives you four starters

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
this little cup screen and then you have

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
way I find to do this you just want us

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.080 
way I find to do this you just want us
to<00:04:47.620> be<00:04:47.740> see<00:04:47.980> right<00:04:48.250> here

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.460 

first<00:04:58.090> time<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.660> rocket<00:04:58.990> launcher<00:04:59.290> should

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
first time to the rocket launcher should

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.290 
first time to the rocket launcher should
do<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.800> because<00:05:00.010> there's<00:05:00.190> some<00:05:00.760> asshole<00:05:01.210> is

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
do it because there's some asshole is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.000 
do it because there's some asshole is
not<00:05:01.450> even<00:05:01.690> with<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.990> roller<00:05:02.200> shooting<00:05:02.710> at<00:05:02.830> you

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
not even with the roller shooting at you

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.640 
not even with the roller shooting at you
doesn't<00:05:03.790> really<00:05:03.880> make<00:05:04.090> any<00:05:04.150> sense<00:05:04.630> and<00:05:05.410> then

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
doesn't really make any sense and then

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.920 
doesn't really make any sense and then
you<00:05:05.800> get<00:05:05.920> copper<00:05:06.400> town<00:05:06.640> from<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.270> truck<00:05:07.750> yard

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
you get copper town from the truck yard

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.250 
you get copper town from the truck yard
district<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.740> at<00:05:09.640> this<00:05:09.790> point<00:05:10.060> there's<00:05:10.660> one

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
district and at this point there's one

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.400 
district and at this point there's one
neighborhood<00:05:11.830> left<00:05:12.100> for<00:05:12.670> being<00:05:13.390> fobbed<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.350> I

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
neighborhood left for being fobbed but I

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.020 
neighborhood left for being fobbed but I
did<00:05:14.620> there's<00:05:14.770> only<00:05:14.980> one<00:05:15.280> neighborhood<00:05:15.730> left

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
did there's only one neighborhood left

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.080 
did there's only one neighborhood left
for<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.780> rollers<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:17.830> think<00:05:18.160> one<00:05:18.970> or

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
for the rollers and I think one or

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.480 
for the rollers and I think one or
submission<00:05:19.660> probably<00:05:20.410> two<00:05:20.680> missions<00:05:21.100> up<00:05:21.310> for

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
submission probably two missions up for

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.520 
submission probably two missions up for
the<00:05:21.580> rollers<00:05:21.790> so<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.780> game's<00:05:22.960> pretty<00:05:23.260> much

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
the rollers so the game's pretty much

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.970 
the rollers so the game's pretty much
over<00:05:23.800> for<00:05:24.600> me<00:05:26.760> but<00:05:27.760> beat<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.900> storm<00:05:29.050> home<00:05:29.380> and

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
over for me but beat the storm home and

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.820 
over for me but beat the storm home and
you<00:05:30.190> get<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.430> neighborhood
