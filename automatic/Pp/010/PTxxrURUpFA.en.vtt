it's made by BA FX which I don't know
what<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> means<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.370> gonna<00:00:41.520> assume<00:00:41.670> it's

it's very easy as you can see here you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's very easy as you can see here you
pair<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.440> doesn't<00:00:49.649> say<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> plug<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> into

turn<00:03:21.349> your<00:03:21.560> Bluetooth<00:03:21.680> on

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.369 

and<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.859> see<00:03:28.069> obd2<00:03:28.670> is<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:30.079> doesn't

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
and you can see obd2 is there it doesn't

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.860 
and you can see obd2 is there it doesn't
show<00:03:30.500> up<00:03:30.590> at<00:03:30.680> first<00:03:30.939> just<00:03:31.939> open<00:03:32.209> up<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.689> menu

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
show up at first just open up the menu

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.729 
show up at first just open up the menu
and<00:03:33.319> then<00:03:34.280> hit<00:03:34.849> scan<00:03:35.359> for<00:03:35.599> search<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.349> devices

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
and then hit scan for search for devices

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.000 
and then hit scan for search for devices
which<00:03:36.890> is<00:03:37.010> right<00:03:37.159> here<00:03:37.189> and<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:39.530> gonna<00:03:39.709> scan

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
which is right here and it's gonna scan

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.289 
which is right here and it's gonna scan
right<00:03:40.129> now<00:03:40.310> but<00:03:40.489> there's<00:03:40.640> no<00:03:40.730> other<00:03:40.879> devices

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
right now but there's no other devices

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.349 
right now but there's no other devices
that<00:03:41.689> also<00:03:42.409> may<00:03:42.739> try<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.010> hook<00:03:43.609> up<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.879> my<00:03:43.969> radio

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
that also may try to hook up to my radio

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.569 
that also may try to hook up to my radio
for<00:03:44.599> some<00:03:44.719> reason<00:03:44.989> but<00:03:45.799> I<00:03:46.069> haven't<00:03:46.459> found

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
for some reason but I haven't found

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.929 
for some reason but I haven't found
actually<00:03:46.909> does<00:03:47.060> anything<00:03:48.159> all<00:03:49.159> right<00:03:49.370> we're

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
actually does anything all right we're

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.379 
actually does anything all right we're
all<00:03:50.060> connected<00:03:50.980> next<00:03:51.980> thing<00:03:52.189> we<00:03:52.280> do<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.609> open

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
all connected next thing we do is open

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.330 
all connected next thing we do is open
up<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> torque<00:03:53.750> application<00:03:56.980> when<00:03:57.980> we<00:03:58.159> just

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
up the torque application when we just

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:13.780 
up the torque application when we just
down<00:03:58.519> left<00:03:58.730> there<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:07.459> we'll<00:04:07.549> start<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.879> car

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.300 

all<00:04:14.420> right<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:14.659> we<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:14.930> revs<00:04:15.230> those<00:04:15.860> actually

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
all right so we get revs those actually

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.490 
all right so we get revs those actually
the<00:04:16.910> RPMs<00:04:17.359> actually<00:04:17.750> do<00:04:17.900> match<00:04:18.109> up<00:04:18.139> with

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
the RPMs actually do match up with

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.499 
the RPMs actually do match up with
what's<00:04:18.709> on<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.919> dashboard<00:04:19.400> which<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.299> great

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
what's on the dashboard which is great

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.140 
what's on the dashboard which is great
and<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:21.769> car<00:04:21.979> did<00:04:22.190> flash<00:04:22.430> trouble<00:04:22.970> code

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
and this car did flash trouble code

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150 
and this car did flash trouble code
which<00:04:23.570> we<00:04:23.750> in<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.169> previous<00:04:24.500> video<00:04:24.590> attempted

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
which we in a previous video attempted

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.920 
which we in a previous video attempted
to<00:04:25.220> fix<00:04:25.460> with<00:04:25.639> an<00:04:25.789> o2<00:04:26.060> sensor<00:04:26.419> because<00:04:26.780> we

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to fix with an o2 sensor because we

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.350 
to fix with an o2 sensor because we
thought<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:28.759> was<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:28.910> downstream

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
thought that it was a downstream

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.580 
thought that it was a downstream
catalytic<00:04:29.870> converter<00:04:30.139> so<00:04:30.289> we're<00:04:30.410> going<00:04:30.500> to

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
catalytic converter so we're going to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.360 
catalytic converter so we're going to
hit<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.889> check<00:04:30.919> obd<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.650> says<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.009> tap<00:04:34.220> the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
hit the check obd and it says to tap the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.870 
hit the check obd and it says to tap the
screen<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.759> scan<00:04:34.970> for<00:04:35.120> faults

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
screen to scan for faults

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:45.090 
screen to scan for faults
this<00:04:37.360> may<00:04:37.510> take<00:04:37.720> some<00:04:37.930> time

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.010 

so<00:04:45.640> yeah<00:04:45.760> before<00:04:45.880> we<00:04:46.120> attempted<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.510> replace

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
so yeah before we attempted to replace

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.270 
so yeah before we attempted to replace
the<00:04:47.200> o2<00:04:47.320> because<00:04:47.740> we<00:04:47.830> thought<00:04:47.980> maybe<00:04:48.100> was

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
the o2 because we thought maybe was

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.800 
the o2 because we thought maybe was
getting<00:04:48.520> poor<00:04:48.730> readings<00:04:49.120> from<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.330> catalytic

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
getting poor readings from the catalytic

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.020 
getting poor readings from the catalytic
converter<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.200> that's<00:04:50.440> why<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.710> p<00:04:51.310> 0<00:04:51.340> for<00:04:51.850> 2<00:04:52.000> 0

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
converter and that's why the p 0 for 2 0

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.830 
converter and that's why the p 0 for 2 0
code<00:04:52.510> was<00:04:52.660> being<00:04:52.900> thrown<00:04:54.180> because<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.510> cat<00:04:55.690> is

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
code was being thrown because the cat is

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
code was being thrown because the cat is
actually<00:04:56.050> on<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.170> down<00:04:56.320> pipe<00:04:56.500> that<00:04:56.680> isn't

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
actually on the down pipe that isn't

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.140 
actually on the down pipe that isn't
really<00:04:56.980> that<00:04:57.070> old<00:04:57.340> so<00:04:57.580> maybe<00:04:57.760> since<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.060> was

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
really that old so maybe since it was

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.210 
really that old so maybe since it was
sitting<00:04:58.390> around<00:04:58.710> actually<00:04:59.710> now<00:04:59.830> that<00:04:59.890> I<00:05:00.130> think

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
sitting around actually now that I think

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
sitting around actually now that I think
about<00:05:00.460> since<00:05:00.760> it<00:05:00.820> was<00:05:00.940> sitting<00:05:01.120> around

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
about since it was sitting around

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.430 
about since it was sitting around
there's<00:05:01.420> a<00:05:01.450> good<00:05:01.600> chance<00:05:01.780> of<00:05:01.960> some<00:05:02.080> chipmunk

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
there's a good chance of some chipmunk

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.750 
there's a good chance of some chipmunk
to<00:05:02.560> build<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.830> nest<00:05:03.040> in<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.310> since<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.550> was<00:05:03.640> in

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
to build the nest in it since it was in

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.930 
to build the nest in it since it was in
my<00:05:03.850> garage<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.420> there<00:05:05.200> we<00:05:05.320> go<00:05:05.500> p<00:05:06.280> 0<00:05:06.550> for<00:05:06.760> 2<00:05:06.910> 0

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940

below<00:05:09.280> threshold<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:10.660> what<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:10.990> means<00:05:11.170> is

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
below threshold and what that means is

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.700 
below threshold and what that means is

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
that the oxygen sensor the oxygen sensor

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.870 
that the oxygen sensor the oxygen sensor
itself<00:05:15.010> is<00:05:15.990> saying<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:18.310> catalytic

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
itself is saying that the catalytic

you<00:05:32.730> know<00:05:32.820> it<00:05:33.000> shows<00:05:33.210> your<00:05:33.449> rpms<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.260> shows

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
you know it shows your rpms it shows

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.090 
you know it shows your rpms it shows
coolant<00:05:35.280> temps<00:05:35.580> at<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.820> bottom

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.930 

it<00:05:39.640> shows<00:05:40.000> what<00:05:40.240> engine<00:05:40.630> vacuum<00:05:40.840> is<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:42.760> then

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
it shows what engine vacuum is and then

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.830 
it shows what engine vacuum is and then
you<00:05:43.120> know<00:05:43.240> if<00:05:43.420> you<00:05:43.570> were<00:05:43.750> to

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.810 

even<00:05:49.410> shows<00:05:49.650> throttle<00:05:50.160> position

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.990 

it<00:05:54.330> does<00:05:54.540> all<00:05:54.690> this<00:05:54.780> in<00:05:54.960> real<00:05:55.110> time<00:05:55.820> if<00:05:56.820> you

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
it does all this in real time if you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.260 
it does all this in real time if you
were<00:05:57.180> even<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.230> middle<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:59.240> you<00:06:00.240> know

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
were even in the middle of you know

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.530 
were even in the middle of you know
you've<00:06:00.510> got<00:06:01.250> multiple<00:06:02.250> different<00:06:02.540> screens

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
you've got multiple different screens

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.090 
you've got multiple different screens
you<00:06:03.660> can<00:06:03.750> flip<00:06:04.020> through<00:06:04.200> so<00:06:04.590> you<00:06:04.650> can<00:06:04.740> have<00:06:04.980> the

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
you can flip through so you can have the

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.490 
you can flip through so you can have the
tag<00:06:05.340> as<00:06:05.550> big<00:06:05.730> as<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:05.910> want<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:07.290> way<00:06:07.440> you

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
tag as big as you want that way you

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.920 
tag as big as you want that way you
could<00:06:07.740> also<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.970> could<00:06:09.150> mount<00:06:09.270> it<00:06:09.420> up<00:06:09.540> on<00:06:09.720> the

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
could also you could mount it up on the

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.330 
could also you could mount it up on the
dash<00:06:10.170> if<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.530> want<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.800> do<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:11.100> while<00:06:11.250> you're

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
dash if you want to do that while you're

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.980 
dash if you want to do that while you're
driving<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:11.940> can<00:06:11.970> see<00:06:12.270> diagnosed<00:06:12.750> at<00:06:12.900> the

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
driving you can see diagnosed at the

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.710 
driving you can see diagnosed at the
same<00:06:13.140> time<00:06:13.350> I<00:06:13.530> mean<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:14.100> this<00:06:14.280> a<00:06:14.600> you<00:06:15.600> know

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
same time I mean is this a you know

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.260 
same time I mean is this a you know
honestly<00:06:16.170> whether<00:06:16.710> or<00:06:16.830> not<00:06:16.950> you<00:06:17.910> can<00:06:18.090> there

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
honestly whether or not you can there

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.580 
honestly whether or not you can there
are<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.420> lot<00:06:18.570> of<00:06:18.600> other<00:06:18.780> devices<00:06:19.080> that<00:06:19.410> will<00:06:19.470> do

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
are a lot of other devices that will do

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.890 
are a lot of other devices that will do
this<00:06:19.710> as<00:06:19.890> well<00:06:20.010> so<00:06:20.070> you<00:06:20.220> can<00:06:20.430> check<00:06:21.390> what<00:06:21.630> was

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
this as well so you can check what was

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.040 
this as well so you can check what was
your<00:06:22.050> 0<00:06:22.260> to<00:06:22.350> 60<00:06:22.650> time<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.190> then<00:06:23.280> best<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:23.730> know

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
your 0 to 60 time and then best you know

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.150 
your 0 to 60 time and then best you know
obviously<00:06:25.050> I<00:06:25.080> do<00:06:25.170> not<00:06:25.290> advise<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:25.800> do<00:06:25.920> this<00:06:26.010> on

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
obviously I do not advise you do this on

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.040 
obviously I do not advise you do this on
the<00:06:26.190> street<00:06:26.310> but<00:06:26.790> everybody<00:06:27.570> has<00:06:27.720> some<00:06:27.900> fun

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
the street but everybody has some fun

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.650 
the street but everybody has some fun
every<00:06:28.260> now<00:06:28.380> and<00:06:28.500> again<00:06:28.530> so<00:06:29.520> yeah<00:06:30.000> these<00:06:30.420> are

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
every now and again so yeah these are

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.570 
every now and again so yeah these are
obviously<00:06:31.170> not<00:06:31.290> real<00:06:31.680> numbers<00:06:32.130> I<00:06:32.430> mean

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
obviously not real numbers I mean

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.460 
obviously not real numbers I mean
they're<00:06:32.910> based<00:06:33.120> off<00:06:33.330> of<00:06:33.360> Matt<00:06:33.720> calculations

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
they're based off of Matt calculations

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.530 
they're based off of Matt calculations
so<00:06:34.770> they're<00:06:34.920> not<00:06:35.040> really<00:06:35.430> you're<00:06:36.330> not<00:06:36.360> going

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
so they're not really you're not going

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.780 
so they're not really you're not going
to<00:06:36.630> really<00:06:36.780> get<00:06:37.050> real<00:06:37.320> horsepower<00:06:37.890> and<00:06:38.430> you

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
to really get real horsepower and you

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.640 
to really get real horsepower and you
know<00:06:38.880> torque<00:06:39.180> numbers<00:06:39.540> unless<00:06:39.840> you're<00:06:40.110> on<00:06:40.350> a

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
know torque numbers unless you're on a

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.730 
know torque numbers unless you're on a
dyno<00:06:41.750> but<00:06:42.750> you<00:06:42.960> know<00:06:43.050> you<00:06:43.110> can<00:06:43.320> play<00:06:43.470> with<00:06:43.590> that

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
dyno but you know you can play with that

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.870 
dyno but you know you can play with that
if<00:06:43.860> you<00:06:43.950> want<00:06:44.130> to<00:06:44.220> and<00:06:44.430> as<00:06:44.490> you<00:06:44.580> can<00:06:44.700> see

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
you can you know you can clear your

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.930 
you can you know you can clear your
fault<00:06:52.560> codes<00:06:52.830> on<00:06:53.040> here<00:06:53.220> as<00:06:53.310> well<00:06:53.490> if<00:06:53.640> you<00:06:53.760> want

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
fault codes on here as well if you want

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.390 
fault codes on here as well if you want
to<00:06:54.000> do<00:06:54.210> that<00:06:54.560> they'll<00:06:55.560> come<00:06:55.770> back<00:06:55.920> if<00:06:56.190> you<00:06:56.220> have

to do that they'll come back if you have

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.000 
to do that they'll come back if you have
real<00:06:56.610> faults<00:06:56.970> though<00:06:57.350> within<00:06:58.350> X<00:06:58.680> amount<00:06:58.920> of

time

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.800

and that's it I mean I'm pretty
impressed<00:07:02.930> with<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:03.229> program<00:07:03.560> so<00:07:03.740> far<00:07:03.800> it

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
impressed with the program so far it

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.469 
impressed with the program so far it
gives<00:07:04.280> me<00:07:04.430> a<00:07:04.460> lot<00:07:04.699> of<00:07:04.880> different<00:07:05.120> things<00:07:05.240> I<00:07:05.419> can
