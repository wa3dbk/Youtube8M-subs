00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
from toy hacks for making this review

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.049 
from toy hacks for making this review
possible<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:38.100> sent<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> bunch<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.700> over

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
possible they sent a bunch of these over

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.090 
possible they sent a bunch of these over
and<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.600> think<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.050> are<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.800> cool

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
and I think these are really cool

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
and I think these are really cool
they're<00:00:41.280> basically<00:00:41.640> backdrops<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.510> your

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
they're basically backdrops for your

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.570 
they're basically backdrops for your
action<00:00:43.440> figures<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.949> if<00:00:44.040> you're<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.309> into

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
action figures so if you're really into

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.820 
action figures so if you're really into
posing<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.180> figures<00:00:45.540> you're<00:00:46.140> into<00:00:46.290> a<00:00:46.320> cba

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
posing your figures you're into a cba

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.400 
posing your figures you're into a cba
and<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.269> into<00:00:48.629> painting<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and you're not really into painting and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.080 
and you're not really into painting and
you<00:00:49.769> know<00:00:49.890> developing<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.430> own<00:00:50.489> backdrops

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you know developing your own backdrops

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670 
you know developing your own backdrops
and<00:00:51.300> stuff<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.080> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.320> perfect

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and stuff like that then this is perfect

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.079 
and stuff like that then this is perfect
for<00:00:52.830> you<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.070> perfect<00:00:53.400> for<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.670> I'm

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
for you it's perfect for me because I'm

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.330 
for you it's perfect for me because I'm
not<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.420> into<00:00:54.540> building<00:00:55.290> dioramas<00:00:55.589> I<00:00:56.010> like

not really into building dioramas I like
collecting<00:00:56.579> action<00:00:57.180> figures<00:00:57.450> imposing<00:00:57.989> them

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

that I'm showing over here you get three

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.299 
that I'm showing over here you get three
different<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.530> actually<00:01:04.890> there's<00:01:05.039> four

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
different or actually there's four

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
different or actually there's four
different<00:01:05.339> sizes<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.509> choose<00:01:06.840> from

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
different sizes that you can choose from

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.170 
different sizes that you can choose from
they're<00:01:07.200> small<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.550> eight<00:01:08.820> inches

they're small which is only eight inches

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.940 
they're small which is only eight inches
tall<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:09.990> there's<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> medium<00:01:10.830> which

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
tall and then there's the medium which

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
tall and then there's the medium which
is<00:01:10.979> 10<00:01:11.220> inches<00:01:11.490> tall<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:12.149> large<00:01:12.479> ones<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
is 10 inches tall these large ones in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
is 10 inches tall these large ones in
front<00:01:13.830> those<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.220> 12<00:01:14.520> inches<00:01:14.759> tall<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> then

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
front those are 12 inches tall and then

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060 
front those are 12 inches tall and then
the<00:01:15.600> larger<00:01:16.050> ones<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.680> those<00:01:16.800> are<00:01:16.920> called

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the larger ones I think those are called

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
the larger ones I think those are called
the<00:01:17.160> cube<00:01:17.490> sizes<00:01:17.970> those<00:01:18.180> are<00:01:18.360> 14<00:01:18.780> point<00:01:19.050> 75

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the cube sizes those are 14 point 75

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
the cube sizes those are 14 point 75
inches<00:01:19.860> tall<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.360> large<00:01:21.570> ones

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
inches tall I just like the large ones

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.180 
inches tall I just like the large ones
and<00:01:21.899> then<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.110> cube<00:01:22.440> ones<00:01:22.649> right<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
and then the cube ones right there and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.650 
and then the cube ones right there and
to<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.399> with<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> backdrops<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.450> also

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
to go with the backdrops you can also

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.540 
to go with the backdrops you can also
buy<00:01:24.990> tiling<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.070> them<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.369> i<00:01:26.490> think

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
buy tiling to go with them which i think

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.400 
buy tiling to go with them which i think
is<00:01:26.820> great<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.390> there's<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.690> black<00:01:27.990> panels

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
is great so there's these black panels

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.969 
is great so there's these black panels
right<00:01:28.560> over<00:01:28.830> here<00:01:29.099> I<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.149> teletraan<00:01:30.660> one

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
right over here I have the teletraan one

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.680 
right over here I have the teletraan one
set<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.099> so<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.459> gonna<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.179> tiles<00:01:33.479> for

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
set up so I'm gonna have the tiles for

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.469 
set up so I'm gonna have the tiles for
that<00:01:33.959> it's<00:01:34.679> called<00:01:34.770> what's<00:01:35.759> called<00:01:36.060> robot

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that it's called what's called robot

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
that it's called what's called robot
base<00:01:36.690> or<00:01:36.899> robot<00:01:37.140> hero<00:01:37.319> base<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:37.830> here's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
base or robot hero base and then here's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
base or robot hero base and then here's
the<00:01:38.220> sandy<00:01:39.030> ground<00:01:39.300> right<00:01:39.599> there<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.080> have

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the sandy ground right there so I have

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.779 
the sandy ground right there so I have
some<00:01:40.380> tiles<00:01:40.709> for<00:01:40.860> those<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.610> actually

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
some tiles for those and they actually

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.680 
some tiles for those and they actually
have<00:01:42.179> this<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.869> low<00:01:43.259> tack<00:01:43.709> decals<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:45.270> attach

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
have this very low tack decals to attach

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.419 
have this very low tack decals to attach
them<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.289> can<00:01:46.500> put<00:01:46.679> them<00:01:46.740> side<00:01:46.979> by<00:01:47.009> side

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
them so you can put them side by side

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.309 
them so you can put them side by side
and<00:01:47.849> then<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.030> tape<00:01:48.479> them<00:01:48.599> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> back<00:01:49.110> as

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
and then just tape them to the back as

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.749 
and then just tape them to the back as
you<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.800> right<00:01:49.979> over<00:01:50.039> here<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.580> they're

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you can see right over here and they're

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.190 
you can see right over here and they're
very<00:01:50.789> easy<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.270> work<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.929> stick

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
very easy to work with and they stick

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960 
very easy to work with and they stick
pretty<00:01:52.470> well<00:01:52.679> I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.550> think<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.819> gonna

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
pretty well I don't think you're gonna

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
pretty well I don't think you're gonna
want<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.270> use<00:01:54.420> regular<00:01:54.869> scotch<00:01:55.200> tape<00:01:55.440> because

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
want to use regular scotch tape because

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.900 
want to use regular scotch tape because
you<00:01:55.679> don't<00:01:55.830> want<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.039> tear<00:01:56.280> anything<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.849> I

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
you don't want to tear anything and I

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.339 
you don't want to tear anything and I
highly<00:01:57.149> recommend<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.840> set<00:01:58.020> these<00:01:58.170> up

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
highly recommend that you set these up

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.350 
highly recommend that you set these up
on<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.500> perfectly<00:01:58.890> flat<00:01:59.280> surface<00:01:59.340> I<00:02:00.000> say<00:02:00.209> be

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
on a perfectly flat surface I say be

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.580 
on a perfectly flat surface I say be
very<00:02:00.569> generous<00:02:00.959> with<00:02:01.020> those<00:02:01.289> stickers

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
very generous with those stickers

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
very generous with those stickers
because<00:02:01.950> sometimes<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.459> get<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:03.119> bit

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
because sometimes you get a little bit

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
because sometimes you get a little bit
of<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.509> bumps<00:02:03.929> coming<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.349> you<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.739> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
of a bumps coming up and you can see the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.919 
of a bumps coming up and you can see the
white<00:02:05.160> coming<00:02:05.459> from<00:02:05.640> underneath<00:02:05.970> as<00:02:06.569> I<00:02:06.720> could

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
white coming from underneath as I could

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.440 
white coming from underneath as I could
see<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:08.009> flipping<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.429> over<00:02:08.759> yeah<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
see as I'm flipping this over yeah that

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
see as I'm flipping this over yeah that
looks<00:02:09.630> very<00:02:10.020> smooth<00:02:10.380> I'm<00:02:10.709> liking<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.220> lot

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
looks very smooth I'm liking that a lot

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.949 
looks very smooth I'm liking that a lot
and<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.849> think<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.120> quality<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.660> these<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
and I think the quality for these is

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.660 
and I think the quality for these is
very<00:02:12.989> good<00:02:13.349> as<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.650> see<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> nice

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
very good as you can see this is a nice

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
very good as you can see this is a nice

thick piece of cardboard over here so I

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.320 
thick piece of cardboard over here so I
really<00:02:16.800> dig<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.670> paint<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.060> very

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
two of them put together a one gripe of

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.729 
two of them put together a one gripe of
mine<00:03:11.329> though<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.719> that<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:11.989> don't<00:03:12.200> connect

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
mine though is that they don't connect

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.439 
mine though is that they don't connect
perfectly<00:03:13.099> as<00:03:13.549> you<00:03:13.579> can<00:03:13.790> see<00:03:13.969> it<00:03:14.180> kind<00:03:14.359> of

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:14.449 
perfectly as you can see it kind of

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.240 
perfectly as you can see it kind of
repeats<00:03:14.959> right<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.799> kind<00:03:16.069> of<00:03:16.099> have

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
repeats right there so you kind of have

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.369 
repeats right there so you kind of have
to<00:03:16.280> tape<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> inward<00:03:17.599> or<00:03:17.870> maybe<00:03:18.109> cut<00:03:18.349> it

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
to tape it inward or maybe cut it

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.289 
to tape it inward or maybe cut it
yourself<00:03:18.889> which<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.459> actually<00:03:19.790> still<00:03:20.060> doesn't

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
yourself which is actually still doesn't

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.849 
yourself which is actually still doesn't
really<00:03:20.389> look<00:03:20.629> too<00:03:20.689> bad<00:03:21.079> but<00:03:21.139> yeah<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.680> don't

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
really look too bad but yeah they don't

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.949 
really look too bad but yeah they don't
line<00:03:22.099> up<00:03:22.340> perfectly<00:03:22.639> but<00:03:23.060> these<00:03:23.329> two<00:03:23.629> sides

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
line up perfectly but these two sides

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.050 
line up perfectly but these two sides
are<00:03:24.230> sold<00:03:24.469> separately<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.040> typically<00:03:25.939> you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
are sold separately so typically you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.580 
are sold separately so typically you
just<00:03:26.269> have<00:03:26.449> one<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.780> these<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.199> like<00:03:27.349> these

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
just have one of these and I like these

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.409 
just have one of these and I like these
larger<00:03:28.099> ones<00:03:28.129> because<00:03:28.639> my<00:03:28.819> masterpiece

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
larger ones because my masterpiece

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.569 
larger ones because my masterpiece
transformers<00:03:29.989> figures<00:03:30.379> are<00:03:30.650> on<00:03:31.010> average

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
transformers figures are on average

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.640 
transformers figures are on average
about<00:03:31.699> 10<00:03:32.060> inches<00:03:32.389> tall<00:03:32.629> something<00:03:33.319> like<00:03:33.439> that

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
about 10 inches tall something like that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.679 
about 10 inches tall something like that
so<00:03:33.949> I<00:03:34.189> want<00:03:34.639> them<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.790> fit<00:03:35.060> pretty<00:03:35.239> well<00:03:35.510> with

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.449 
so I want them to fit pretty well with

one up together I haven't done it and
they<00:03:57.650> don't<00:03:57.889> actually<00:03:58.430> line<00:03:58.970> up<00:03:59.180> perfectly

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
they don't actually line up perfectly
