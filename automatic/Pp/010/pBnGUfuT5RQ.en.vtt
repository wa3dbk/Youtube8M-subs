00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
the thing that I find so hard to swallow

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.100 
the thing that I find so hard to swallow
with<00:00:49.339> this<00:00:49.519> system<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:50.449> know<00:00:50.570> that's

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
with this system is you know that's

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.840 
with this system is you know that's
we're<00:00:51.949> not<00:00:52.040> going<00:00:52.159> to<00:00:52.220> see<00:00:52.280> any<00:00:52.430> more<00:00:52.519> triple

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
we're not going to see any more triple

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.270 
we're not going to see any more triple
axels<00:00:53.150> this<00:00:53.269> afternoon<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.769> triple<00:00:55.040> axle

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
axels this afternoon and the triple axle

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.630 
axels this afternoon and the triple axle
is<00:00:55.489> such<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.239> difficult<00:00:56.659> jump<00:00:57.199> but<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.830> tariff<00:00:58.430> of

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
is such a difficult jump but a tariff of

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.110 
is such a difficult jump but a tariff of
that<00:00:58.850> combination<00:00:59.530> 9.5<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.949> less<00:01:01.760> than

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
that combination 9.5 is less than

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.990 
that combination 9.5 is less than
somebody<00:01:02.510> doing<00:01:02.659> triple<00:01:02.960> its<00:01:03.199> triple<00:01:03.500> toe<00:01:10.000> you

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
somebody doing triple its triple toe you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
somebody doing triple its triple toe you
know<00:01:11.120> there's<00:01:11.299> no<00:01:11.390> point<00:01:11.540> in<00:01:11.690> taking<00:01:11.810> that

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
know there's no point in taking that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.899

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.469 
good as any that we're gonna see there's
no<00:01:49.490> doubt<00:01:49.700> about<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.150> one

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
no doubt about that one

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.570 
no doubt about that one
really<00:01:51.260> she<00:01:51.710> tends<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.920> go<00:01:52.040> on<00:01:52.130> an<00:01:52.220> outside

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
really she tends to go on an outside

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.310 
really she tends to go on an outside
edge<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:52.880> then<00:01:53.030> roll<00:01:53.240> back<00:01:53.270> onto<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> inside

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
edge and then roll back onto the inside

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.890 
edge and then roll back onto the inside
so<00:01:54.619> no<00:01:55.190> problem<00:01:55.610> on<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.820> edge<00:01:55.940> there<00:01:56.240> they

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
so no problem on the edge there they

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.230 
so no problem on the edge there they
shouldn't<00:01:57.170> pull<00:01:57.409> anything<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.790> spins

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
shouldn't pull anything on that spins
