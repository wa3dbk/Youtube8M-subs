very warm and Italian County and they

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
very warm and Italian County and they
don't<00:01:08.050> speak<00:01:08.410> English<00:01:09.040> as<00:01:09.340> much<00:01:09.640> as<00:01:09.970> we<00:01:10.270> do

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.050 

anyway<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:14.200> was<00:01:14.590> walking<00:01:15.460> down<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.700> street

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
anyway so I was walking down the street

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.710 
anyway so I was walking down the street
there<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.460> Florence<00:01:18.460> or<00:01:19.270> something<00:01:19.600> like

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
there and Florence or something like

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.139 
there and Florence or something like
that<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.960> think<00:01:20.800> it<00:01:20.979> was<00:01:21.070> Florence<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.790> was<00:01:21.910> very

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
that I think it was Florence it was very

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.170 
that I think it was Florence it was very
beautiful<00:01:22.630> very<00:01:23.050> historic<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:23.979> full<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:25.149> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
beautiful very historic and full to the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.469 
beautiful very historic and full to the
brim<00:01:26.490> fat<00:01:27.490> American

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.490 

so<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.659> must<00:01:31.930> have<00:01:32.130> influenced<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.430> mean<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.470> I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
so it must have influenced I mean so I

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.499 
so it must have influenced I mean so I
was<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.920> little<00:01:36.340> lost<00:01:36.579> or<00:01:36.909> something<00:01:37.119> this

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
was a little lost or something this

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.570 
was a little lost or something this
could<00:01:37.810> be<00:01:37.990> alive<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.830> think<00:01:39.040> it's<00:01:39.159> gonna<00:01:39.340> be

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
could be alive and I think it's gonna be

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.700 
could be alive and I think it's gonna be
a<00:01:39.610> good<00:01:39.850> story<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.720> thought<00:01:44.049> I'd<00:01:44.229> ask<00:01:44.439> this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710
