 The cost of simple water cooling 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.440
 H 60 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:24.390
 It is this to say that we do not use 8 well retail cooler 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:29.180
 I did not use the cooler I'm listening to because I was planning to use this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:35.440
 8 members are water cooled, so only cpu will cool 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:37.130
 I'm looking at various reviews and I think it 's the easiest size to use 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.560
 To 62 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:46.750

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.750
 Tsu do not know the guy and the little Shiteyari for the first time spear Why in the water of the cooler say 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.489
 It would be easy if everyone said that it was easy to do 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.489
 It means 4 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.750
 Yes, No 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.760
 3rd place 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.130

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.090
 frozen 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.179

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.179

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.540

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.350
 Nde is written in the meeting 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.200
 I think that it can be attached quite easily 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.549
 Say 2nd 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.549
 That's the main part 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.870
 Take 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.820
 Four days 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.890

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.080
 The 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 When the motor comp and mer feed evolution come together 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.930
