00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
it's not all about just what's in the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.970 
it's not all about just what's in the
future<00:00:03.240> it's<00:00:03.389> also<00:00:03.680> important<00:00:04.680> for<00:00:04.710> us<00:00:04.950> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
future it's also important for us to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.070 
future it's also important for us to
recognize<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:06.120> establish<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:06.779> was<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.020> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
recognize and establish what was in the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.940 

when<00:00:23.680> we<00:00:23.800> design<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.779> mighty<00:00:25.779> FC<00:00:25.989> concept<00:00:26.710> the

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
when we design the mighty FC concept the

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.159 
when we design the mighty FC concept the
idea<00:00:26.980> was<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.489> get<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.329> totally<00:00:28.660> recreate

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
idea was to get that totally recreate

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.550 
idea was to get that totally recreate
the<00:00:29.439> original<00:00:29.590> Willy's<00:00:30.550> FC<00:00:30.970> but<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.810> recall

the<00:01:06.440> whole<00:01:06.590> reason<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.950> built<00:01:07.160> it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.000 

it's<00:01:10.480> very<00:01:10.780> very<00:01:11.050> important<00:01:11.410> for<00:01:11.500> us<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.680> do

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
it's very very important for us to do

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.650 
it's very very important for us to do
when<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.640> when<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:12.940> make<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.480> of<00:01:13.570> these

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
when we when we make one of these

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.980 
when we when we make one of these
vehicles<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:14.740> it's<00:01:15.400> got<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.970> work<00:01:16.150> we<00:01:16.720> come<00:01:16.960> out

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
vehicles a it's got to work we come out

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.110 
vehicles a it's got to work we come out
here<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.470> Moab<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.280> really<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:19.090> first

here to Moab this is really the first
time<00:01:19.510> we<00:01:19.660> test<00:01:19.900> these<00:01:20.050> things<00:01:20.290> it's<00:01:20.830> got<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.130> be

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
time we test these things it's got to be

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.880 
time we test these things it's got to be
very<00:01:21.430> very<00:01:21.550> robust<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.050> that's<00:01:23.350> key<00:01:23.680> it's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
very very robust and that's key it's

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.530 
very very robust and that's key it's
built<00:01:24.160> in<00:01:24.310> all<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.580> way<00:01:24.670> through<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.360> mighty
