00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:11.360
 Yes in this video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:15.590
 We will comment on security measures for PCs 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.710
 Even though something there is a difficult image and say security measures 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.599
 There are two main pillars of security measures 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 One of the information handled in Aso 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.880
 Some information may be seen even if it sees in the morning, and some information may not be seen by people. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.379
 not 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.700
 Whether you can control such information properly 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.740
 It is possible to prevent the leakage of information that you do not want to see 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.960
 This is one thing 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:51.300
 Another thing is that the third party can not control your computer 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 It becomes a major pillar of security measures 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.220
 The Nehito one eye of You're information 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.720
 The most important thing is to prevent people from seeing data you don't want to see 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.449
 Easy thing is password dot 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.630
 It is a way of thinking 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:18.170
 If you use a computer with multiple people, set an account for each user and set a password 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:21.679
 If you turn it on, it is only by doing so the usage environment for people with one computer 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.020
 Thus the information is protected after different 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:28.180
 Because there is such a merit 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:35.410
 I think that giving a password is very significant 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:40.590
 A It is then computer in order to not be controlled to a third party like the Toka virus 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.590
 It 's a story of what to do to get rid of it 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.020
 It is antivirus software that comes out by all means by all means 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.500
 so 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.050
 eh 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:59.230
 It is a place where this is a big deal 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.150
 I also studied wood security, but at least I have security measures in the mac 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.970
 I have not put software 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.600
 It is a very important place here 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.900
 Even when I used windows, I did not have security software. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.530
 Or why 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.930
 I'm heavy is very action 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.890
 Because that current software may not be so, I say in the knowledge that I know 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.880
 Well since the are 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.850
 I 'm sorry if it is different 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.130
 We thought that it was good to put anti-virus software 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:41.430
 The new squirrel 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:43.110
 Toka wonder if helped me something when the trouble really Toka Do not occur was seen that the corresponding 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.170
 I remember a lot 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:52.120
 You or I Na what does not make sense even put so much 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:57.670
 However, in the case of a company, there is a lot of information that bears various social responsibility, so it can be entered 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.250
 I think that it is good, but when it is said that it is necessary to overdo it and use it for individual use 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.770
 There is a question mark 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.260
 So how can you prevent someone else from hijacking your computer ? 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.680
 it's simple 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 Keep your computer up-to-date 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:19.170
 I think with a variety of software has been installed, but os itself 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.170
 There are windows and mac etc. Keep it always up-to-date 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 Keep your security in perfect condition 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.330
 After that the program called Fireball is sure 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.120
 I have put it in 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.120
 Also other software of Char 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.920
 Unexpectedly, the side is said to be a security hole 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.490
 There is a possibility that the computer may be taken over 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:53.020
 It is vital that any software be kept up to date 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:58.090
 So it's here that you run with minimal software 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:02.580
 Being used in a minimal environment because management is very difficult 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:07.610
 Well , it means that we will be connected there 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:11.690
 When that does not want to be seen information from the third party is 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.590
 I divide the account which locks the computer with the password for every user 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.720
 In order for this to not be taken over It is point your computer to a third party is 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:26.210
 Make an effort to keep the computer up to date 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:31.460
 Always keep your computer up-to-date This is the point 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.600
 As for anti- virus software, the pros and cons will be divided, but if you are a company, you should put in 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.120
 I think it's good 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.889
 If you are an individual, please add anxious person 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.500
 I have not put 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:50.520
 In the first half of the 2000s, it is true that the virus was also infected 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:55.020
 Hey How long it took to worm say waste to the company 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:58.060
 There was no other than that, but after that I can not go to a site I do not know well 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.190
 We do not exclude a little unfriendly site 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:07.320
 It is by moving it strange structure with head is and will be seen in the curious 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:13.070
 There is Try to be careful because there is a possibility that or got hijacked 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.070
