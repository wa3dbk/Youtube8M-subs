00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
to my you know scratch test but what we

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.709 
to my you know scratch test but what we
found<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:20.819> mark<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.239> pendant

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.300 
mark in it
to<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.180> sure<00:03:32.420> I'm<00:03:32.599> Tyrion<00:03:32.959> employee<00:03:33.349> and<00:03:33.740> then

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
to be sure I'm Tyrion employee and then

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.210 
to be sure I'm Tyrion employee and then
I'll<00:03:34.670> place<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.270> acid<00:03:35.709> directly<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:37.160> that

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
I'll place the acid directly in that

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.320 
I'll place the acid directly in that
spot<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.010> always<00:03:40.160> start<00:03:40.459> with<00:03:40.610> 14-karat

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
spot and you always start with 14-karat

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.210 
spot and you always start with 14-karat
ass<00:03:41.450> shows<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> best<00:03:42.110> reaction<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.800> of

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
ass shows the best reaction and of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.180 
ass shows the best reaction and of
course<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.790> turns<00:03:44.180> green<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.349> starts<00:03:46.040> to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
course it turns green and starts to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.770 
course it turns green and starts to
bubble<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.640> little<00:03:46.760> indicating<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.510> it's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
bubble a little indicating that it's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.620 
bubble a little indicating that it's
fake<00:03:48.110> whereas<00:03:48.920> if<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.550> put<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.940> acid<00:03:50.360> on

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
fake whereas if I just put the acid on

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.930 
fake whereas if I just put the acid on
the<00:03:50.870> test<00:03:51.230> line<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:53.209> line<00:03:53.920> stays<00:03:54.920> turns<00:03:55.819> a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
the test line the line stays turns a

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.710 
the test line the line stays turns a
little<00:03:56.060> Brown<00:03:56.420> kind<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.870> indicating<00:03:57.470> 10<00:03:57.739> karat

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
little Brown kind of indicating 10 karat

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.330 
little Brown kind of indicating 10 karat
so<00:03:59.720> that's<00:04:00.170> where<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.800> be<00:04:00.920> misleading

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
so that's where it can be misleading

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.070 
so that's where it can be misleading
with<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.819> now<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.060> know<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.870> have

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
with that now I know if you have

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.290 
with that now I know if you have
something<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.519> know<00:04:04.610> someone's<00:04:05.030> not

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
something that you know someone's not

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.720 
something that you know someone's not
willing<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.720> part<00:04:06.019> with<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.890> best<00:04:07.250> thing<00:04:07.519> you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
willing to part with the best thing you

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.570 
willing to part with the best thing you
can<00:04:07.970> do<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.930> take<00:04:09.290> your<00:04:09.500> piece<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.010> just

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
can do is take your piece and just

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.539 
can do is take your piece and just
instead<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.299> doing<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.690> quick<00:04:12.019> scratch

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
instead of doing just a quick scratch

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.259 
instead of doing just a quick scratch
really<00:04:14.590> kind<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.709> push<00:04:16.010> harder<00:04:16.639> and<00:04:16.669> try<00:04:17.209> to

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
really kind of push harder and try to

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.319 
really kind of push harder and try to
scratch<00:04:17.750> longer<00:04:18.590> just<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.609> make<00:04:19.790> sure<00:04:19.820> that

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
scratch longer just to make sure that

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.480 
scratch longer just to make sure that
you<00:04:20.479> actually<00:04:20.660> get<00:04:21.169> through<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.370> know

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
you actually get through you know

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.640 
you actually get through you know
whatever<00:04:22.729> plating<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.510> might<00:04:23.720> be<00:04:24.139> there<00:04:24.440> and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
whatever plating that might be there and

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.010 
whatever plating that might be there and
even<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.860> can't<00:04:28.160> file<00:04:28.490> deep<00:04:28.850> into<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.510> try

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
even if you can't file deep into it try

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.200 
even if you can't file deep into it try
to<00:04:30.080> find<00:04:30.380> maybe<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.710> worn<00:04:31.040> spot<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.639> it<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:31.970> then

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
to find maybe a worn spot on it and then

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.879 
to find maybe a worn spot on it and then
just<00:04:32.360> put<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.720> acid<00:04:32.870> directly<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.680> their

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
just put the acid directly on their

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.800 
just put the acid directly on their
piece<00:04:34.190> most<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.150> time<00:04:35.330> if<00:04:35.479> there's<00:04:35.660> any

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
piece most of the time if there's any

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.779 
piece most of the time if there's any
kind<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.110> worn<00:04:36.350> spot<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.010> acid<00:04:37.400> will<00:04:37.550> you

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
kind of worn spot that the acid will you

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.340 
kind of worn spot that the acid will you
know<00:04:37.880> creep<00:04:38.300> right<00:04:38.479> in<00:04:38.690> there<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.050> start

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
know creep right in there and start

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.080 
know creep right in there and start
exposing<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.979> because<00:04:40.190> it'll<00:04:40.400> change<00:04:40.430> colors

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
exposing it because it'll change colors

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.050

other<00:05:17.600> thing<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.140> want<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.440> talk<00:05:18.620> about<00:05:18.800> is

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
other thing that I want to talk about is

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.290 
other thing that I want to talk about is
using<00:05:19.520> acids<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.479> know<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:21.050> reactions<00:05:21.650> you

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
using acids to know the reactions you

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.130 
using acids to know the reactions you
whenever<00:05:23.300> you're<00:05:23.600> starting<00:05:23.900> off<00:05:23.990> if<00:05:24.080> you

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
whenever you're starting off if you

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.680 
whenever you're starting off if you
don't<00:05:24.260> know<00:05:24.470> something<00:05:24.770> start<00:05:25.310> with<00:05:25.690> 14-karat

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
don't know something start with 14-karat

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.170 
don't know something start with 14-karat
there's<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.080> big<00:05:27.530> thing<00:05:28.130> here<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.520> can't<00:05:28.940> just

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
there's a big thing here you can't just

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.540 
there's a big thing here you can't just
start<00:05:29.389> with<00:05:29.600> like<00:05:29.770> ten<00:05:30.770> to<00:05:31.280> see<00:05:31.460> if

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
start with like ten to see if

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.460 
start with like ten to see if
something's<00:05:31.940> fake<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.450> 10<00:05:32.720> carat<00:05:33.139> acid

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
something's fake it 10 carat acid

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.170 
something's fake it 10 carat acid
doesn't

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
doesn't

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.560 
doesn't
the<00:05:34.449> same<00:05:34.720> with<00:05:35.560> plated<00:05:36.400> items<00:05:36.699> as<00:05:36.940> like<00:05:37.090> 14

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
the same with plated items as like 14

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.840 
the same with plated items as like 14
does<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.380> doesn't<00:05:38.560> give<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:38.919> that<00:05:38.949> bright

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
does it doesn't give you that bright

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.600 
does it doesn't give you that bright
green<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.720> bubbling<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.470> you<00:05:41.830> know<00:05:41.979> it<00:05:42.220> might

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
green the bubbling and you know it might

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.460 
green the bubbling and you know it might
do<00:05:42.759> it<00:05:42.880> on<00:05:42.940> some<00:05:43.240> pieces<00:05:43.509> but<00:05:44.020> it<00:05:44.110> doesn't<00:05:44.410> do

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
do it on some pieces but it doesn't do

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.350 
do it on some pieces but it doesn't do
it<00:05:44.560> as<00:05:44.650> intensely<00:05:45.280> and<00:05:45.759> what<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.120> have<00:05:46.210> to

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
it as intensely and what you have to

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.960 
it as intensely and what you have to
watch<00:05:46.479> out<00:05:46.690> about<00:05:46.870> 18<00:05:47.110> karat<00:05:47.710> 22<00:05:48.340> karat<00:05:48.639> acid

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
watch out about 18 karat 22 karat acid

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.939 
watch out about 18 karat 22 karat acid
using<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.389> is<00:05:49.509> it<00:05:49.660> is<00:05:49.780> such<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:49.990> powerful<00:05:50.470> acid

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
using it is it is such a powerful acid

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.790 
using it is it is such a powerful acid
that<00:05:51.460> often<00:05:51.789> times<00:05:51.940> maybe<00:05:52.389> the<00:05:52.570> items<00:05:52.870> 10

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
that often times maybe the items 10

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.189 
that often times maybe the items 10
karat<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.460> you<00:05:54.520> put<00:05:54.729> 18<00:05:55.120> karat<00:05:55.419> on<00:05:55.539> it<00:05:55.720> we've

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
karat and you put 18 karat on it we've

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.999 
karat and you put 18 karat on it we've
had<00:05:56.229> it<00:05:56.680> actually<00:05:57.280> cause<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.910> item<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:59.009> bubble

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
had it actually cause the item to bubble

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.550 
had it actually cause the item to bubble
like<00:06:00.520> not<00:06:01.090> bubble<00:06:01.660> like<00:06:01.810> get<00:06:01.990> all<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.259> smoke

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
like not bubble like get all the smoke

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.950 
like not bubble like get all the smoke
but<00:06:02.770> like<00:06:03.009> kind<00:06:03.610> of<00:06:03.699> fizz<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.000> little<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:04.720> turn

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
but like kind of fizz a little and turn

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.379 
but like kind of fizz a little and turn
a<00:06:04.990> weird<00:06:05.320> color<00:06:05.680> making<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.880> know<00:06:07.000> us<00:06:07.180> who

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
a weird color making the you know us who

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:08.640 
a weird color making the you know us who
was<00:06:07.539> testing<00:06:07.900> it<00:06:07.990> seeing<00:06:08.169> like<00:06:08.410> his<00:06:08.530> little

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
was testing it seeing like his little

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.830 
was testing it seeing like his little
fake<00:06:08.949> we<00:06:09.759> you<00:06:10.060> know<00:06:10.150> I've<00:06:10.270> got<00:06:10.509> one<00:06:10.539> of<00:06:10.750> those

fake we you know I've got one of those
portable<00:06:11.139> X<00:06:11.440> or<00:06:11.650> F<00:06:11.770> machines<00:06:12.220> you<00:06:12.490> know<00:06:12.610> that

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
portable X or F machines you know that

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.870 
portable X or F machines you know that
scans<00:06:13.660> it<00:06:13.900> so<00:06:14.080> we<00:06:14.199> can<00:06:14.410> definitely<00:06:14.949> verify

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
scans it so we can definitely verify

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.510 
scans it so we can definitely verify
whether<00:06:16.090> anything<00:06:16.660> is<00:06:16.949> plated<00:06:17.949> or<00:06:18.099> not<00:06:18.250> I<00:06:18.460> know

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
whether anything is plated or not I know

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.939

dealers and he called he was just like
this<00:06:32.919> is<00:06:33.130> crazy<00:06:33.400> like<00:06:33.580> every<00:06:33.910> one<00:06:34.060> of<00:06:34.150> my

like what and then he's like yeah we put
18<00:06:38.919> karat<00:06:39.159> acid<00:06:39.490> on<00:06:39.580> everything<00:06:40.060> and<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:40.750> was

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
18 karat acid on everything and it was

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.719 
18 karat acid on everything and it was
like<00:06:41.080> whoa<00:06:41.260> whoa<00:06:41.470> whoa<00:06:41.710> that's<00:06:42.130> your<00:06:42.430> problem

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
like whoa whoa whoa that's your problem

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.899 
like whoa whoa whoa that's your problem
right<00:06:42.970> there<00:06:43.330> because<00:06:43.919> 18<00:06:44.919> karat<00:06:45.340> and<00:06:45.520> 22

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
right there because 18 karat and 22

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.820 
right there because 18 karat and 22
karat<00:06:46.150> is<00:06:46.210> just<00:06:46.360> too<00:06:46.539> powerful<00:06:46.750> to<00:06:47.199> use<00:06:47.500> as

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
karat is just too powerful to use as

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.219 
karat is just too powerful to use as
that<00:06:47.889> determining<00:06:48.669> factor<00:06:49.150> so<00:06:49.659> if<00:06:49.930> you're

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
that determining factor so if you're

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.320 
that determining factor so if you're
going<00:06:50.409> to<00:06:50.530> test<00:06:50.800> if<00:06:51.039> something's<00:06:51.490> plated<00:06:52.000> use

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
going to test if something's plated use

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330 
going to test if something's plated use
your<00:06:52.570> 14<00:06:52.990> you<00:06:53.169> should<00:06:53.380> go<00:06:53.530> through<00:06:53.800> about

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
your 14 you should go through about

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.060 
your 14 you should go through about
three<00:06:54.820> times<00:06:55.090> as<00:06:55.300> much<00:06:55.419> 14<00:06:55.870> karat<00:06:56.199> acid<00:06:56.590> as<00:06:56.710> any
