00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.479
 he explained 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.119
 in total there are 15 surgeries 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.119
 the nature magazine 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.359
 one-way match 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
 every human being in my life 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 Besides that 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 let's be successful 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 ef 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 more calm 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.420
 in this action 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 even if it goes well 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 look well 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.940
 A thought 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 the trash 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.020
 the room 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350
 Not even in the movies. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 I think not 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.730
 the people 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.030
 I go out again 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.430
 we battle 2 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.560
 I think for you with honor. 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.780
 Let's go with a bigger team, I liked you so much with all this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.010
 music in barzinho 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.010
 each one a different way I have mine 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.510
 As always, people can not hold on to harmony and peace. 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.819
 prevent the day 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.939
 they can not kill music melodies because they can not 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.339
 I gave 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.379
 the screen has to be put 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.039
 the protocol of quito coe respect and same day of the song tá 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.639
 so cool now you've seen it like it's common in common 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.059
 uribe said itch 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.429
 so look at it 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.429
 and production 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.279
 slow down 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.639
 that's it 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.239
 pay close attention 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.239
 ancient and production the shorter 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.209
 two agreements three to four at the most 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.129
 It went in very well, never entered. 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.299
 You'll end up if you're listening. 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.299
 so I tried to score the pack 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.209
 one of the mizael brothers have music 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.209
 There is no one who has the economic agreement of Rondônia. 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.309
 let's get acquainted now 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.969
 of the various 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.459
 because I say 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.289
 toronto 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.949
 in the interview 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.949
 because that leader 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.229
 it is as if he spoke 'not of the agreements 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.779
 they go somewhere 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.269
 rossi never saw the program puts the scale on the other 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.650
 but he will come back here surely you will follow each color 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.999
 will make opinions 3 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.840
 buy a little more 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.099
 the brothers of rondônia 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.099
 my life 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.770
 technical note 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 even dealing 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.990
 How are we ever going to slow down? 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.789
 and another very important thing is that you can not be arrested 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.729
 at 25 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.610
 of high a kind of beat you can do whatever you want these can 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.009
 with this song doing it 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.009
 amazing music and fashion if you do 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.659
 will not change anything just can not change the harmonic sequence according to the 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.479
 my day 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.930
 the beat you musician will be 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.919
 and Maria Salomé 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.919
 lr 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.159
 also advises 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.970
 It's so much for you here because everyone wonders how this thing 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.460
 and what does it do to give 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.460
 despite the young age to work for parliamentarians 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.949
 this is it 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.469
 the captain dredging 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.379
 so basically it was just that, it does not have much to do 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.539
 do 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.850
 As I said here, it's only a matter of walking the levada beat as you please because I fear 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.819
 I know it separates a space to show 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.330
 to the rhythm or right 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.949
 fact that it can be difficult because the court has received seven patients and 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.669
 purchase and report the agreement 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.439
 he said 'she said he was there the body now the tennis player of the right hand 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.879
 none of them had a right so you do not see anyone doing 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.949
 now the dollar is just 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.630
 and this is what happened 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.630
 can this be what you can do here? 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.029
 stage 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.729
 said 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.319
 slowly 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.319
 the public sector 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.139
 Never 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.839
 So 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.090
 I just feel that music 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.090
 does not mean that you will have always wanted to play that way 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.660
 you can not choose any type of beat as long as you keep as 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.490
 I already told you 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.499
 harmony you started 

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:37.699
 and price alignment almost killing if you can not make the 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.430
 beat 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.060
 So that's it, people get in the next field the corner understood but the 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.060
 crowd will take a while but may falter 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.169
 beyond the test 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.379
 the tame stocking 

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:56.169
 I signed
