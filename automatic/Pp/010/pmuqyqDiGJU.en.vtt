00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
on it here and we're going to get our

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.300 
on it here and we're going to get our
coordinates<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
coordinates for it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.670 
coordinates for it
alright<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.510> are<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.720> coordinates<00:02:07.020> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
alright so here are the coordinates that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.700 
alright so here are the coordinates that
I'm<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.430> need<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:08.940> right<00:02:09.600> now<00:02:10.410> let's

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
I'm going to need all right now let's

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.390 
I'm going to need all right now let's
switch<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.850> regular<00:02:12.750> view<00:02:13.260> here<00:02:13.590> all

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
switch back to regular view here all

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.820 
switch back to regular view here all
right<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.090> I've<00:02:15.180> got<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.450> coordinates<00:02:16.170> there

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
right so I've got my coordinates there

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.430 
right so I've got my coordinates there
on<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> computer<00:02:17.220> now<00:02:17.790> when<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.960> just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
on the computer now when you do is just

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.980 
on the computer now when you do is just
stick<00:02:19.770> them<00:02:19.890> into<00:02:20.100> my<00:02:20.370> gps<00:02:20.610> unit<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.810> I'm<00:02:21.960> going

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
stick them into my gps unit so I'm going

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.520 
stick them into my gps unit so I'm going
to<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.650> what's<00:02:22.830> called<00:02:23.010> adding<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.030> waypoint

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
to do what's called adding a waypoint

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.650 
to do what's called adding a waypoint
now<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.710> different<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.160> each<00:02:26.220> GPS<00:02:26.850> I've<00:02:27.390> got

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
now it's different for each GPS I've got

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.640 
now it's different for each GPS I've got
a<00:02:27.690> rhino<00:02:27.990> 120<00:02:29.210> but<00:02:30.210> just<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:30.510> any<00:02:30.840> portable

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
a rhino 120 but just about any portable

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.950 
a rhino 120 but just about any portable
gps<00:02:31.980> they'll<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.730> look<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.330> I'll<00:02:33.690> kind

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
gps they'll all look like this I'll kind

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.390 
gps they'll all look like this I'll kind
of<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.140> an<00:02:34.260> antenna<00:02:34.530> sticking<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.280> them

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
of have an antenna sticking out of them

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.240 
of have an antenna sticking out of them
this<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> type<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.360> GPS<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.170> want<00:02:37.250> this

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
this is the type of GPS you want this

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.530 
this is the type of GPS you want this
thing<00:02:38.310> they're<00:02:38.730> kind<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.940> built<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.330> more

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
thing they're kind of built to be more

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.800 
thing they're kind of built to be more
rugged<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.950> there<00:02:41.640> they<00:02:42.210> can<00:02:42.360> definitely

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
rugged to be there they can definitely

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.270 
rugged to be there they can definitely
handle<00:02:42.990> getting<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.470> little<00:02:43.620> bit<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.890> water<00:02:44.070> on

them or you can drop them and they're
not<00:02:45.960> going<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.200> break<00:02:46.440> they're<00:02:46.740> nice<00:02:46.890> and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
not going to break they're nice and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.090 
not going to break they're nice and
rubber<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.540> they're<00:02:49.500> designed<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.860> take<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
rubber and they're designed to take a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.680 
rubber and they're designed to take a
beating<00:02:50.370> ok<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.820> don't<00:02:53.970> want<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.210> use<00:02:54.360> your

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
beating ok so you don't want to use your

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.660 
beating ok so you don't want to use your
automotive<00:02:55.230> GPS<00:02:55.860> or<00:02:56.100> something<00:02:56.460> like<00:02:56.610> that

those things are delicate and well
they're<00:02:59.550> not<00:02:59.580> even<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.210> able<00:03:00.240> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
they're not even going to be able to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.060 
they're not even going to be able to
accept<00:03:00.780> those<00:03:00.930> coordinates<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.650> most<00:03:01.800> cases

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
accept those coordinates in most cases

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.380 
accept those coordinates in most cases
they're<00:03:02.580> designed<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.910> find<00:03:03.090> street

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
they're designed to find street

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.450 
they're designed to find street
addresses<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.440> once<00:03:04.590> you've<00:03:04.740> got<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:04.950> weight

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
addresses so once you've got that weight

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.750 
addresses so once you've got that weight
won't<00:03:05.760> put<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.180> well<00:03:07.220> now<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.370> time<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.640> go

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
won't put in well now it's time to go

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.550 
won't put in well now it's time to go
find<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.209> now<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.780> put<00:03:10.020> in<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.170> whole<00:03:10.350> bunch

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
find it now you can put in a whole bunch

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.140 
find it now you can put in a whole bunch
of<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:11.010> preparation<00:03:11.610> for<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.790> camping

we start walking to look for it we're my
upper<00:04:54.550> window<00:04:56.160> alright<00:04:57.160> so<00:04:57.400> I'm<00:04:57.490> trying<00:04:57.730> to

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
upper window alright so I'm trying to

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.580 
upper window alright so I'm trying to
record<00:04:58.210> right<00:04:58.480> now<00:04:58.510> as<00:04:58.660> we're<00:04:58.960> walking<00:04:59.140> I'm

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
record right now as we're walking I'm

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.930 
record right now as we're walking I'm
just<00:04:59.770> trying<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.040> follow<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.550> arrow<00:05:00.700> as

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
just trying to follow the arrow as

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.940 
just trying to follow the arrow as
straight<00:05:01.180> as<00:05:01.300> possible<00:05:01.470> since<00:05:02.470> we're<00:05:02.740> thin

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
straight as possible since we're thin

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.860 
straight as possible since we're thin
about<00:05:03.190> 40<00:05:03.640> feet<00:05:03.880> which<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:04.150> about<00:05:04.810> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
about 40 feet which is about the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.900 
about 40 feet which is about the
accuracy<00:05:05.500> of<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.130> GPS<00:05:06.610> unit<00:05:07.300> itself<00:05:07.660> so<00:05:08.910> at

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
accuracy of the GPS unit itself so at

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.530 
accuracy of the GPS unit itself so at
this<00:05:10.540> point<00:05:10.780> it's<00:05:11.320> time<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.710> start<00:05:11.950> thinking

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
this point it's time to start thinking

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.270 
this point it's time to start thinking
where<00:05:13.540> would<00:05:13.780> they<00:05:13.930> have<00:05:13.960> hidden<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.680> to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
where would they have hidden it and to

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.880 
where would they have hidden it and to
start<00:05:15.520> ignoring<00:05:15.820> our<00:05:16.090> GPS<00:05:16.600> so<00:05:17.530> that's<00:05:17.710> what

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
start ignoring our GPS so that's what

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.260 
start ignoring our GPS so that's what
we're<00:05:18.040> going<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.310> do<00:05:18.460> we're<00:05:18.760> looking<00:05:19.030> for<00:05:19.240> a

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
we're going to do we're looking for a

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.620 
we're going to do we're looking for a
micro<00:05:19.810> cash<00:05:20.050> it's<00:05:20.560> really<00:05:21.130> small<00:05:24.300> up<00:05:25.300> did<00:05:25.540> you

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
this thing we're in the right area now

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.770 
this thing we're in the right area now
ok<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.500> I've<00:05:39.460> come<00:05:39.700> at<00:05:39.910> this<00:05:40.060> from<00:05:40.120> multiple

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
ok so I've come at this from multiple

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.990 
ok so I've come at this from multiple
garage

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
garage

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.480 
garage
and<00:05:42.510> everything<00:05:42.930> is<00:05:43.020> telling<00:05:43.350> me<00:05:43.380> life<00:05:44.280> in

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
and everything is telling me life in

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.810 
and everything is telling me life in
this<00:05:44.610> area<00:05:45.140> especially<00:05:46.250> most<00:05:47.250> likely<00:05:47.610> right

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
this area especially most likely right

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.430 
this area especially most likely right
here<00:05:49.790> and<00:05:50.790> was<00:05:51.150> attached<00:05:51.420> by<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.660> magnet<00:05:52.170> found

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
here and was attached by a magnet found

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.200 
here and was attached by a magnet found
it<00:05:53.120> underneath<00:05:54.230> this<00:05:55.230> grill<00:05:55.650> right<00:05:55.890> here<00:05:56.210> and

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
it underneath this grill right here and

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.670 
it underneath this grill right here and
it<00:05:57.300> makes<00:05:57.450> sense<00:05:57.660> because<00:05:57.810> one<00:05:58.200> of<00:05:58.230> the<00:05:58.440> clues

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
it makes sense because one of the clues

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.740 
it makes sense because one of the clues
I<00:05:58.890> read<00:05:59.100> is<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.760> must<00:06:00.000> not<00:06:00.180> have<00:06:00.390> survived

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
I read is that it must not have survived

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.560 
I read is that it must not have survived
the picnics<00:06:01.440> over<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:01.890> live<00:06:02.070> forward<00:06:02.570> which

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
the picnics over to live forward which

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.300 
the picnics over to live forward which
meant<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.260> original<00:06:04.590> one<00:06:04.710> must<00:06:04.950> have<00:06:05.070> burned

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
meant the original one must have burned

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.480 
meant the original one must have burned
this<00:06:05.460> is<00:06:05.670> the<00:06:05.790> new<00:06:05.940> one<00:06:06.150> so<00:06:07.190> when<00:06:08.190> we've<00:06:08.310> got

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
this is the new one so when we've got

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.620 
this is the new one so when we've got
here<00:06:08.820> now<00:06:09.030> is<00:06:09.870> our<00:06:10.230> little<00:06:10.890> log<00:06:11.100> book<00:06:11.420> so<00:06:12.420> will

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
here now is our little log book so will

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:19.340 
here now is our little log book so will
sign<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:15.290> probably<00:06:16.290> carry<00:06:16.710> on<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:19.110> is

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
sign it and probably carry on that is

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.620 
sign it and probably carry on that is
hall<00:06:20.330> for<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.360> first<00:06:21.630> one<00:06:21.810> since<00:06:22.020> short<00:06:23.630> all
