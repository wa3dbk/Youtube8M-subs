these are the boat shuttles and you have
a<00:00:21.680> spring-loaded<00:00:22.680> section<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:25.670> two<00:00:26.670> slits

important<00:00:31.320> these<00:00:31.380> holes<00:00:31.850> you<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> make

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
important these holes you want to make

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.049 
important these holes you want to make
sure<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.600> holes<00:00:33.840> aren't<00:00:34.200> worn<00:00:34.440> thin

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
sure these holes aren't worn thin

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.080 
sure these holes aren't worn thin
otherwise<00:00:36.770> your<00:00:37.770> thread<00:00:38.070> could<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.489> cut<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
otherwise your thread could get cut and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.510 
otherwise your thread could get cut and
basically<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.149> start<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.540> your<00:00:42.660> bobbin

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
basically you start with your bobbin

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.990 
basically you start with your bobbin
your<00:00:44.520> threads<00:00:44.850> coming<00:00:46.370> over<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> bobbin<00:00:47.850> like

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
your threads coming over the bobbin like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.060 
your threads coming over the bobbin like
this<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> load<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.219> your

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
this and you want to load it into your

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.410 
this and you want to load it into your
your<00:00:56.070> spring-loaded<00:00:56.640> point<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.180> press

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
your spring-loaded point and then press

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.290 
your spring-loaded point and then press
it<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.219> where<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> pops<00:01:02.489> in

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.580 

then<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:06.420> want<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.930> thread<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
then you want to take your thread and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
then you want to take your thread and
bring<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:09.410> this<00:01:10.410> slot<00:01:10.920> first<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.850> then

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
bring it out this slot first and then

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440 
bring it out this slot first and then
loop<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> around<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.410> come<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:15.180> upper

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
loop it around to come back in the upper

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.910 
loop it around to come back in the upper
slot<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.440> in<00:01:16.620> this<00:01:16.740> direction<00:01:18.920> let's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
slot and then up in this direction let's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:43.690 
slot and then up in this direction let's
see<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.100> quickly<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.550> can<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.950 

okay<00:01:44.740> look

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.760 

okay

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.310 

so<00:01:57.369> now<00:01:57.520> we<00:01:57.579> bring<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.150> up<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:58.990> go<00:01:59.140> up

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
so now we bring it up and we go up

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.440 
so now we bring it up and we go up
through<00:01:59.560> these<00:01:59.710> holes<00:01:59.979> these<00:02:00.939> are<00:02:01.119> actually

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
through these holes these are actually

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.530 
through these holes these are actually
tensioning<00:02:02.049> holes<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.579> come<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:03.939> through<00:02:04.329> and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
tensioning holes you come up through and

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.899 
tensioning holes you come up through and
you<00:02:05.049> can<00:02:05.200> zigzag<00:02:05.860> through<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.580> want<00:02:06.729> to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
you can zigzag through and you want to

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.010 
you can zigzag through and you want to
finish<00:02:07.060> coming<00:02:07.630> up<00:02:09.300> through<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> last<00:02:10.660> hole

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
finish coming up through the last hole

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.620 
finish coming up through the last hole
closest<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.890> point<00:02:15.239> what<00:02:16.239> I'm<00:02:16.360> going<00:02:16.599> to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
closest to the point what I'm going to

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.420 
closest to the point what I'm going to
do<00:02:16.840> with<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.319> one<00:02:17.560> I'm<00:02:17.709> just<00:02:17.769> going<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:20.250> go<00:02:21.250> up

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
do with this one I'm just going to go up

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.150 
do with this one I'm just going to go up
through

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.860 

and<00:02:30.670> I'm<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.300> go<00:02:31.420> back<00:02:31.600> down

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and I'm just going to go back down

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:48.559 
and I'm just going to go back down
through<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:41.340> center<00:02:42.340> ones

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.360 

keep<00:02:49.200> getting<00:02:49.439> my<00:02:49.530> fingers<00:02:49.739> caught<00:02:50.099> on<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
keep getting my fingers caught on the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.050 
keep getting my fingers caught on the
thread<00:02:51.889> and<00:02:52.889> then<00:02:53.340> finally<00:02:53.790> I'm<00:02:53.879> going<00:02:53.999> to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
thread and then finally I'm going to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.170 
thread and then finally I'm going to
finish<00:02:54.209> coming<00:02:54.569> up<00:02:54.749> through<00:02:55.999> the<00:02:56.999> hole

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
finish coming up through the hole

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.750 
finish coming up through the hole
closest<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> point<00:02:58.459> now<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.549> can<00:02:59.670> go

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
closest to the point now you can go

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.660 
closest to the point now you can go
through<00:02:59.999> a<00:03:00.030> couple<00:03:00.269> times<00:03:01.159> if<00:03:02.159> you<00:03:02.340> require

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
through a couple times if you require

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.920 
through a couple times if you require
more<00:03:02.909> attention<00:03:05.120> over<00:03:06.120> only<00:03:06.299> once<00:03:06.629> if<00:03:06.810> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
more attention over only once if you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.970 
more attention over only once if you
don't<00:03:07.109> need<00:03:07.230> any<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:10.200> there<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.859> have<00:03:10.889> it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.729 

let's<00:03:16.980> see<00:03:17.159> our<00:03:17.219> thread

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.880 

threw<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.579> up<00:03:21.409> zigzag<00:03:22.409> through<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> holes<00:03:24.890> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
threw it up zigzag through the holes and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.280 
threw it up zigzag through the holes and
there<00:03:26.099> we<00:03:26.219> go<00:03:26.780> now<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:27.930> see<00:03:28.140> we're

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
there we go now you can see we're

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.319 
there we go now you can see we're
getting<00:03:29.239> good<00:03:30.239> tension<00:03:30.689> with<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:32.239> let<00:03:33.239> me

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
getting good tension with this let me

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.900 
getting good tension with this let me
tell<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.629> doing
