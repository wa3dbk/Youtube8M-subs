00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
I have three different types of wrenches

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.720 
I have three different types of wrenches
here<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.230> of<00:00:39.530> course<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:40.010> flashlight<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:41.270> see<00:00:41.300> I

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
here and of course a flashlight to see I

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.490 
here and of course a flashlight to see I
always<00:00:43.730> try<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:43.940> have<00:00:44.180> multiple<00:00:44.719> types<00:00:45.020> here

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
always try to have multiple types here

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.290 
always try to have multiple types here
because<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:46.219> never<00:00:46.370> know<00:00:46.579> what's<00:00:46.789> gonna<00:00:47.000> fit

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
because you never know what's gonna fit

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.700 
because you never know what's gonna fit
I<00:00:48.039> called<00:00:49.039> this<00:00:49.219> a<00:00:49.489> plumber's<00:00:50.329> edge<00:00:50.710> because

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
I called this a plumber's edge because

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.490 
I called this a plumber's edge because
it<00:00:51.739> fits<00:00:52.250> up<00:00:52.510> vertically<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.010> swivels<00:00:56.500> as

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
it fits up vertically and swivels as

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.889 
it fits up vertically and swivels as
such<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.780> if<00:00:59.840> it's<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:00.199> very<00:01:00.379> tight<00:01:00.739> places

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
such so if it's in very tight places

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.290 
such so if it's in very tight places
very<00:01:02.899> easily<00:01:03.370> next<00:01:04.370> is<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:04.940> pair<00:01:05.210> of

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
very easily next is this pair of

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.010 
very easily next is this pair of

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
channellocks

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.520 
channellocks
they<00:01:06.410> also<00:01:06.650> will<00:01:07.130> adjust<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.150> fit<00:01:08.900> in<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.320> very

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
they also will adjust and fit in a very

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.070 
they also will adjust and fit in a very
narrow<00:01:09.830> opening<00:01:13.960> oil<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.590> else<00:01:15.890> fails<00:01:17.080> cheapo

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
narrow opening oil all else fails cheapo

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.700
