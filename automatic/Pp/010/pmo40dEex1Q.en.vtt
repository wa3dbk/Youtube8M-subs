the last Pratibha cross light to point

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
the last Pratibha cross light to point
out<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.030> pretty<00:01:30.329> high<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> heel<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.040> the

I'd<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:44.880> minimal<00:01:45.149> stuff<00:01:45.329> for

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I'd like to have some minimal stuff for

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.480 
I'd like to have some minimal stuff for
the<00:01:45.780> trails<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.680> don't<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the trails I think I don't like the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
the trails I think I don't like the
laces<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.210> don't<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.540> why<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.020> put<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
laces I don't know why they put this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.109 
laces I don't know why they put this
lace<00:01:49.680> cover<00:01:49.979> over<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> top<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> laces

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
lace cover over the top of the laces

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
lace cover over the top of the laces
there<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.479> mean<00:01:51.689> obviously<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.290> keep<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.619> dirt

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
there I mean obviously to keep out dirt

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770 
there I mean obviously to keep out dirt
and<00:01:53.100> debris<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.000> why<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and debris but why not just have a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.120 
and debris but why not just have a
gusseted<00:01:55.200> tongue<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> tongue<00:01:55.950> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gusseted tongue or a tongue that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
gusseted tongue or a tongue that
connects<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> sidewall<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.630> fact<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
connects to the sidewall the fact that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.330 
connects to the sidewall the fact that
you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.320> something<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> laces

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you have to put something over the laces

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
you have to put something over the laces
I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> bad<00:02:00.360> idea<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I think is a bad idea because I like to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.530 
I think is a bad idea because I like to
adjust<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.070> laces<00:02:02.430> when<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.790> long<00:02:03.000> runs<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
adjust my laces when I'm on long runs I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.209 
adjust my laces when I'm on long runs I
think<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.229> keeps<00:02:04.649> them<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
think this just keeps them in there and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.980 
think this just keeps them in there and
locked<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> problem

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
locked in and I think that's a problem

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
locked in and I think that's a problem
and<00:02:07.380> unfortunately<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.160> said<00:02:08.310> before<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and unfortunately like I said before I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.430 
and unfortunately like I said before I
think<00:02:09.119> they're<00:02:09.509> too<00:02:09.660> stiff<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.110> think<00:02:10.319> for

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
think they're too stiff I think for

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.070 
think they're too stiff I think for
someone<00:02:10.649> like

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
someone like

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.510 
someone like
who<00:02:11.170> likes<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.530> reduced<00:02:11.860> running<00:02:12.190> shoe<00:02:12.310> or<00:02:12.490> a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
who likes a reduced running shoe or a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.820 
who likes a reduced running shoe or a
minimal<00:02:12.880> running<00:02:13.120> shoe<00:02:13.300> that's<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.650> a

minimal running shoe that's just a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.150 
minimal running shoe that's just a
little<00:02:15.130> too<00:02:15.670> stiff<00:02:16.360> for<00:02:16.930> my<00:02:17.110> liking

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
little too stiff for my liking

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.290 
little too stiff for my liking
I<00:02:18.400> wish<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.700> was<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.940> little<00:02:19.090> bit<00:02:19.180> more

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the bottom the material that made this

the bottom the material that made this
shoe<00:02:41.200> are<00:02:41.560> quality<00:02:42.070> comfort<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:43.000> give<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.510> shoe

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
shoe are quality comfort I give the shoe

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.840 
shoe are quality comfort I give the shoe
3<00:02:44.320> out<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.500> 5<00:02:44.740> for<00:02:44.980> comfort<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.490> think<00:02:45.700> it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
3 out of 5 for comfort I think it's

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.730 
3 out of 5 for comfort I think it's
still<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.330> little<00:02:46.600> too<00:02:46.780> stiff<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.320> a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
still just a little too stiff and a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.740 
still just a little too stiff and a
little<00:02:48.010> too<00:02:48.220> thick<00:02:48.580> there<00:02:49.150> along<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.570> bottom

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
little too thick there along the bottom

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.360 
little too thick there along the bottom
so<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.170> not<00:02:50.260> much<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.620> minimal<00:02:50.980> or<00:02:51.100> reduced

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
so it's not much of a minimal or reduced

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.949 
so it's not much of a minimal or reduced
running<00:02:51.670> shoe<00:02:51.850> especially<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.690> trails

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
running shoe especially for the trails

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.480 
running shoe especially for the trails
but<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.500> definitely<00:02:53.860> provides<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.340> some

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
but it definitely provides you with some

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.860 
but it definitely provides you with some
support<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.090> give<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.330> guys<00:02:55.450> three<00:02:55.660> out<00:02:55.840> of

five per rice again three out of five I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.510 
five per rice again three out of five I
think<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.470> price<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.890> reasonable<00:03:00.370> price

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
think the price is a reasonable price

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.860 
think the price is a reasonable price

was<00:03:05.350> cheaper<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.950> was<00:03:06.070> just<00:03:06.430> under<00:03:06.700> ninety<00:03:07.030> but

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
was cheaper it was just under ninety but

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.280 
was cheaper it was just under ninety but
so<00:03:07.330> what<00:03:07.450> did<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.750> at<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.930> four<00:03:08.140> out<00:03:08.230> of

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
so what did have it at a four out of

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.110 
so what did have it at a four out of
five<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.650> think<00:03:08.709> that's<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.100> good<00:03:09.340> place<00:03:09.640> for<00:03:09.940> a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
five I think that's a good place for a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.120 
five I think that's a good place for a
trail<00:03:10.540> running<00:03:10.750> shoe<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.380> maybe<00:03:11.830> even<00:03:12.070> a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
trail running shoe to be maybe even a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.440 
trail running shoe to be maybe even a
little<00:03:12.340> bit<00:03:12.459> cheaper<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.000> gave<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.270> one

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
little bit cheaper so I gave this one

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.970 
little bit cheaper so I gave this one
three<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:13.959> five<00:03:14.140> for<00:03:14.350> being<00:03:14.500> another<00:03:14.770> box

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
three out of five for being another box

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.090 
three out of five for being another box
looks<00:03:15.519> four<00:03:16.450> out<00:03:16.570> of<00:03:16.720> five<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.500> looks<00:03:17.890> like<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
looks four out of five it looks like a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.880 
looks four out of five it looks like a
beast<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.940> runs<00:03:19.330> like<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.570> beast<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> beast

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
beast it runs like a beast it is a beast

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.949 
beast it runs like a beast it is a beast
it's<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.400> foot<00:03:21.580> tank<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.480> I'll<00:03:22.540> give<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.750> four

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
it's a foot tank so I'll give it four

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.449 
it's a foot tank so I'll give it four
out<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.110> five<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.709> brings<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.100> total<00:03:24.280> to

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
out of five so that brings the total to

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.150 
out of five so that brings the total to
14<00:03:25.239> out<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.570> 20<00:03:25.750> which<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.500> really<00:03:26.890> good
