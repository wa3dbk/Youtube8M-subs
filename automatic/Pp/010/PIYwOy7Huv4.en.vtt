more more effort is required to get the

maybe a more maybe just a little more
forthright<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> comes<00:02:35.110> through<00:02:35.349> because

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440

you know but it's still a saxophone it's

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.750 
you know but it's still a saxophone it's
still<00:03:19.239> an<00:03:20.230> approximation<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.459> human

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
still an approximation of the human

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.170 
still an approximation of the human
voice<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.239> stands<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.569> be<00:03:22.780> beautiful<00:03:23.230> so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
voice and it stands to be beautiful so

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.970 
voice and it stands to be beautiful so
there<00:03:25.180> are<00:03:25.419> I<00:03:26.790> think<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:27.940> are<00:03:27.970> ways<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.980> have

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
there are I think there are ways to have

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.319 
there are I think there are ways to have
all<00:03:30.160> those<00:03:30.370> elements<00:03:30.549> present<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
all those elements present in the in the

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.900 
all those elements present in the in the
spectrum<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.560> think<00:03:35.799> Rico<00:03:36.370> Reed's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
spectrum and I think Rico Reed's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:50.789 
spectrum and I think Rico Reed's
helped<00:03:38.340> accomplish<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:49.530> did<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.620> really

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
helped accomplish that did you really

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:58.870 
helped accomplish that did you really
feel<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.069> you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.570 

I<00:04:00.250> was<00:04:01.250> cautioned<00:04:01.730> away<00:04:02.030> from<00:04:03.370> searching<00:04:04.370> for

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
I was cautioned away from searching for

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.160 
I was cautioned away from searching for
that<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:05.750> one<00:04:05.990> moment<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.880> one<00:04:08.170> shining

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
that that one moment that one shining

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:19.420 
that that one moment that one shining
hour<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:10.330> arrival<00:04:14.590> it's<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:17.709> it's<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.860> long<00:04:19.070> path

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
hour of arrival it's a it's a long path

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.300 
hour of arrival it's a it's a long path
but<00:04:19.700> it's<00:04:19.850> relatively<00:04:20.360> straight<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:22.160> know

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
but it's relatively straight you know

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.040 
but it's relatively straight you know
sometimes<00:04:23.090> it's<00:04:23.240> up<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.420> mountain<00:04:23.720> but<00:04:23.870> it's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
sometimes it's up a mountain but it's

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.230 
sometimes it's up a mountain but it's
still<00:04:24.170> straight<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:25.310> know<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:25.910> I<00:04:26.210> feel<00:04:26.990> that

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
still straight you know so I feel that

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.150 
still straight you know so I feel that
the<00:04:29.240> choices<00:04:29.690> that<00:04:29.720> I've<00:04:30.020> made<00:04:30.670> so<00:04:31.670> far<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:33.160> have

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
the choices that I've made so far I have

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.930 
the choices that I've made so far I have
allowed<00:04:34.460> me<00:04:34.670> to<00:04:34.700> travel<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.270> world

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
allowed me to travel the world

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.600 
allowed me to travel the world
experience<00:04:38.380> much<00:04:39.380> more<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:42.040> society<00:04:43.040> than<00:04:43.490> I

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
experience much more of society than I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.680 
experience much more of society than I
ever<00:04:44.560> imagined<00:04:45.560> I<00:04:45.650> would<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:49.240> just<00:04:50.240> it's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
ever imagined I would and just it's

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.210 
ever imagined I would and just it's
allowed<00:04:50.990> me<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.140> experience<00:04:51.560> people<00:04:51.860> on<00:04:52.130> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
allowed me to experience people on the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.000 
allowed me to experience people on the
level<00:04:52.490> where<00:04:52.640> I<00:04:52.670> never<00:04:53.290> really<00:04:54.290> thought<00:04:54.950> that

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
level where I never really thought that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.330 
level where I never really thought that
I<00:04:55.220> would<00:04:55.460> experience<00:04:55.760> people<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:56.510> I<00:04:57.340> don't

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
I would experience people so I don't

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.340 
I would experience people so I don't
know<00:04:58.430> if<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.730> means<00:04:59.120> I've<00:04:59.300> arrived<00:04:59.600> or<00:04:59.840> I

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
know if that means I've arrived or I

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.190 
know if that means I've arrived or I
haven't<00:05:01.420> but<00:05:02.420> I'm<00:05:02.540> not<00:05:02.690> really<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:05.200> haven't

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
haven't but I'm not really I haven't

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.290 
haven't but I'm not really I haven't
really<00:05:06.410> spent<00:05:06.650> much<00:05:06.920> time<00:05:06.950> trying<00:05:07.940> to<00:05:08.090> figure

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
really spent much time trying to figure

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.180 
really spent much time trying to figure
out<00:05:08.330> if<00:05:08.630> I've<00:05:08.870> arrived<00:05:09.350> yet<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:15.160> pay<00:05:16.160> my

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
and and I'll be the first to admit that

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.460 
and and I'll be the first to admit that
I<00:05:24.410> have<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:25.300> had<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.540> still<00:05:26.750> have<00:05:26.930> parents<00:05:27.380> who

were incredibly supportive in that

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.120 
were incredibly supportive in that
endeavor<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:32.410> would<00:05:33.410> not<00:05:33.530> be<00:05:33.590> here<00:05:33.890> without

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.310 
he's always very very encouraging very
encouraging<00:05:56.600> which<00:05:56.840> I<00:05:57.170> find<00:05:57.860> is<00:05:58.460> less<00:05:59.980> common

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
encouraging which I find is less common

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.430 
encouraging which I find is less common
among<00:06:03.320> musicians<00:06:04.990> I'm<00:06:05.990> you<00:06:06.200> know<00:06:06.290> maybe

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
among musicians I'm you know maybe

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.510 
among musicians I'm you know maybe
because<00:06:06.590> people<00:06:06.710> traditionally<00:06:07.040> didn't

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
because people traditionally didn't

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.670 
because people traditionally didn't
think<00:06:07.700> musicians<00:06:08.240> really<00:06:08.479> had<00:06:08.780> much<00:06:09.440> of<00:06:09.470> a

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
think musicians really had much of a

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.510 
think musicians really had much of a
