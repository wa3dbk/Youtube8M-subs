things<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.520> cut<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> down<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.390> see

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
things and have cut it down to it to see

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.139 
things and have cut it down to it to see
if<00:01:51.689> 60<00:01:52.170> parts<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.549> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> depends

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
if 60 parts so it really kind of depends

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
if 60 parts so it really kind of depends
how<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.930> time<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> play<00:01:55.920> but

how much time you want to play but

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.999 
how much time you want to play but
honestly<00:01:56.700> by<00:01:56.969> about<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> third<00:01:57.450> hour

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
honestly by about the third hour

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.649 
honestly by about the third hour
everyone's<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> getting<00:01:59.579> fed<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.509> with

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
everyone's kind of getting fed up with

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929 
everyone's kind of getting fed up with
it<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.649> they've<00:02:01.799> had<00:02:01.979> enough<00:02:02.189> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I think 5 or 6 epochs is is just about

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.430 
I think 5 or 6 epochs is is just about
right<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> fun<00:02:07.950> game<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.080> just

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
right it's a fun game it's it is just

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.140 
right it's a fun game it's it is just
sort<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.340> risk<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
sort of like risk and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.199 
sort of like risk and
in<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.420> sense<00:02:13.079> so<00:02:13.680> four<00:02:14.129> might<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.849> easier<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
in this sense so four might be easier to

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.420 
in this sense so four might be easier to
get<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.540> non<00:02:15.720> gaming<00:02:16.200> buddies<00:02:16.500> involved

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
get your non gaming buddies involved

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.690 
get your non gaming buddies involved
just<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.329> can<00:02:18.480> explain<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.019> them<00:02:19.700> truthfully

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
just you can explain to them truthfully

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.280 
just you can explain to them truthfully
it's<00:02:21.329> kind<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.629> like<00:02:21.840> wrist<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:25.110> that's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
it's kind of like wrist I think that's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's kind of like wrist I think that's
all<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.920> review<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.659> I<00:02:28.040> wouldn't

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
all for this review and I wouldn't

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.380 
all for this review and I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:29.189> getting<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.909> game<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.299> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
recommend getting this game at the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.119 
recommend getting this game at the
prices<00:02:30.870> they're<00:02:31.019> selling<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.709> eBay

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
prices they're selling it up eBay

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.849 
prices they're selling it up eBay
because<00:02:32.579> it's<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.930> ridiculously<00:02:34.500> priced

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
because it's it's ridiculously priced

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.449 
because it's it's ridiculously priced
but<00:02:35.849> if<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.569> find<00:02:36.780> yourself<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.530> copy<00:02:38.069> for

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
but if you can find yourself a copy for

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.059 
but if you can find yourself a copy for
a<00:02:38.489> decent<00:02:39.120> price<00:02:39.359> I<00:02:39.689> know<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.680> might<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:40.950> hard

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
a decent price I know it might be hard

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.160 
a decent price I know it might be hard
cuz<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.519> out<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.670> print<00:02:41.939> then<00:02:42.810> I'd<00:02:42.959> recommend

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
cuz it's out of print then I'd recommend

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.199 
cuz it's out of print then I'd recommend
getting<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:46.230> final<00:02:46.650> note<00:02:47.090> here's<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
getting it one final note here's the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.930 
getting it one final note here's the
rulebook<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.680> black<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:49.980> white<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
rulebook it's just black and white and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.390 
rulebook it's just black and white and
there's<00:02:51.510> no<00:02:51.659> sample<00:02:52.019> turn<00:02:52.409> so<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.889> it's<00:02:53.250> not

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
there's no sample turn so it's it's not

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.080 
there's no sample turn so it's it's not
the<00:02:53.459> best<00:02:53.760> rulebook<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.769> back<00:02:55.980> though<00:02:56.340> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the best rulebook on the back though it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.780 
the best rulebook on the back though it
easily<00:02:57.840> tells<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.739> how<00:02:59.129> much<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.519> different

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
easily tells you how much the different

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.059 
easily tells you how much the different
values<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:01.290> different<00:03:01.500> regions<00:03:01.769> are

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
values of the different regions are

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.539 
values of the different regions are
worth<00:03:02.510> which<00:03:03.510> makes<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.189> little<00:03:05.189> hand<00:03:05.400> here

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
worth which makes the little hand here

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.670 
worth which makes the little hand here
for<00:03:05.879> calculating<00:03:06.540> points<00:03:07.019> but<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.530> not<00:03:07.650> a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
for calculating points but it's not a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.039 
for calculating points but it's not a
very<00:03:07.950> good<00:03:08.129> rulebook<00:03:08.609> things<00:03:09.209> aren't<00:03:09.420> overly

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
very good rulebook things aren't overly

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.500 
very good rulebook things aren't overly
clear<00:03:10.409> it's<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.519> black<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.939> white<00:03:12.120> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
clear it's just black and white and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.929 
clear it's just black and white and
there's<00:03:13.439> no<00:03:13.590> sample<00:03:13.950> turn<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> sample<00:03:14.760> turn<00:03:14.909> I

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
there's no sample turn the sample turn I

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.199 
there's no sample turn the sample turn I
think<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.299> really<00:03:15.599> key<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.470> first<00:03:17.209> time

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
think is really key for a first time

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.289 
think is really key for a first time
game<00:03:18.750> learner<00:03:19.819> anyway<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.849> think<00:03:21.000> that's

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
game learner anyway I think that's

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.830 
game learner anyway I think that's
that's<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:23.299> hope<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.419> enjoyed<00:03:24.690> this

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that's it and hope you enjoyed this
