00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:13.460
(Music)

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.580
(Loud Thumping Sounds)

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.340
Church: Hey Doc, what the hell's going on in there?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.480
Doc: Church, everything's fine. The patient is just resting.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.120
Church: Doesn't sound like he's resting.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.380
Doc: That's not Tucker, that's our new arrival.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.120
He's got a lot of energy since his first feeding.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.200
Church: Tucker, fed, the baby?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.040
Gross.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.380
Doc: Actually, Caboose was kind enough to donate some blood.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.500
You know what they say, "It takes a village."

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.980
Church: How did you get him to agree to that?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.680
Doc: It's amazing what Caboose will do if you promise him a cookie and a glass of orange juice.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.400
Church: But he hates needles.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.360
Doc: No needles. It turns out that if you just expose some bare skin, the little guy just digs rights in.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.980
It's like a miracle to see nature at work.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.140
Caboose: I feel dizzy!

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.720
Church: Um ... Is he gonna be okay?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.240
Doc: Tucker's kid drank half a gallon in one go. Isn't that cool!

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.340
I think he's gonna be a linebacker. Or a vampire. Or a vampire linebacker! That would be crazy.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.800
Caboose: Oooooh ...

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.120
Doc: Anyway, blood is pretty important, so Caboose is bound to have some side effects like dizziness, or

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.960
nausea, or sensitivity to light ...

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.080
Caboose: I think I'm going to stop standing up now.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.640
(Caboose Collapses)

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.100
Doc: ... or passing out.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.340
Caboose: Church, if I die, I want you to have my orange juice.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.300
(Clamoring Intensifies)

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.800
Church: How can Tucker sleep with all that racket?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.400
Doc: Sleeping? He's not sleeping.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.360
He's in a coma.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.200
Church: Alright, that's it. Get out of the way, Doc. I'll take care of this.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840
Caboose: I can't feel my torso!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.200
Doc: I don't think so. A newborn is really susceptible to infection, and disease, and cuddling!

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.080
I only want to expose it to as few people as possible.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.900
Church: Heh, Doc, don't worry. I'm not gonna give it a cold.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.860
I'm just gonna go in there, step on its neck, and shoot it in the head. Because that's how I roll.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.480
Doc: Well, now you're definitely not coming in. And I think we're gonna send back your shower gift, too.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.560
Caboose: I'm still laying here. Why won't anyone help me?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.880
Church: I'll tell you what, I promise to wash my hands before I destroy the abomination of nature, okay?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.400
Doc: Sorry.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.680
Church: Doc, seriously, you can't keep me from going inside my own base.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.360
Doc: Church, don't make me pull rank on you!

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.120
Church: Rh-rank! What the fuck! I outrank ...! You don't outrank me; I'm a Captain.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.420
Doc: No, you're a Private with a dead Captain.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.220
The last time I checked, that makes you a Private ...

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.600
... with a dead Captain.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.920
Caboose: My body is trying to die.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.040
Church: Okay, fine. Then we're both Privates. You don't outrank me.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.320
Doc: No, I'm Medical Super-Private, First Class!

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.660
Church: That's not a real rank.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.220
Doc: Yes it is.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.180
Church: Since when?

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.240
Doc: Uh, since I sent them a letter every day for 4 years requesting that promotion.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.900
Church: They promoted you for THAT!

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.600
You haven't even used your weapon!

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.740
Doc: Leadership isn't about firing bullets and stabbing people Church, leadership is about being able to tell

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.740
others to fire bullets and stab people.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.020
Caboose: If I've been bitten, does that mean I'm going to turn in to one of them?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.580
Church: Shut up Caboose.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.660
Caboose: Blaaaaaaaaaa-

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.740
Church: Shut up Caboose.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.140
Caboose: -aaaaarg. Oh no, don't let me turn.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.300
(Very Loud Crash)

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.660
Church: The hell was that!?

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.300
Caboose: I didn't feel anything.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.240
Church: I'll be right back. Don't feed any more of our soldiers to the Alien.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.360
Doc: Okay, but I can't make any promises.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520
Caboose: Don't leave me with the horrible doctor.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.560
Doc: Oh shut up Caboose.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.040
Caboose: Now he's cursing at me.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.460
Sarge: Simmons, status report. (coughs)

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.920
Simmons: Um, an enormous thing just fell out of the sky, and landed on Donut, Sir.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.240
Sarge: Are there any other injuries?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.060
Simmons: No Sir!

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.820
Sarge: You sure?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.560
Simmons: I think so.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.300
Sarge: Are you sure? No one accidentally got shot in the face when someone else's shotgun just accidentally

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.020
went off during the incredible distraction of a spaceship crash landing. Purely by coincidence?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.140
Simmons: Uh, I don't kno-

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.260
Sarge: No one orange?

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.980
Grif: Uhgh, I'm fine.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.840
Simmons: Sorry Sir.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.940
Sarge: Oh dehrh. I really need to adjust the sights on this thing.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.500
Simmons: What about Private Donut, Sir? There's no way he survived that. Poor Donut. I'll miss him like a sister.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.580
Sarge: I'll miss him like... well, like someone I knew but that I don't really wanna reflect on how deep our

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.460
relationship went.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.020
Simmons: Wait a second, do you hear that? It sounds like tapping.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.340
Grif: All I hear is you guys talkin' about your feelings for Donut.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.320
And I have to say, I'm not really comfortable with that.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.960
Simmons: Listen, there it is again!

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.100
Sarge: You're absolutely right! That sounds like Morris Code.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.940
Simmons: Um, excuse me, Sir, it's actually not Morris Code? It's Morse Code, Sir.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.620
Sarge: Morse, heh. That sounds ridiculous. I don't think so.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.120
Simmons: Yes. Morse is the person who developed an international code for communicating without audio.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.620
Morris was a television cat that sold cat food.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.060
Sarge: And that cat was one of our finest military minds, don't you see?

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.480
That just means Donut is alive and trying to contact us! Now, get to tappin'.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.900
Simmons: Maybe we can lift the ship off of him somehow.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.920
Sarge: Great idea, Simmons! I've read reports that people can get enormous strength

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.140
in stressful situations. There was one woman who lifted a car off her baby.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.380
Grif: You want me to call Donut's mother?

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.640
Sarge: Don't make me angry, Grif. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. Now if only there were some way to tap

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.540
into our inner rage, like that Hulk fella. Dagnabbit! There's never any gamma radiation around when you need it.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.760
Simmons: Well what if we tried getting into the ship, and lowering the landing gear? That might raise the ship-

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.740
Sarge: Or, we could build an army of clones that could lift the ship-

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.980
Simmons: I think that the jack in the Warthog might be able to lift it...

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.420
Sarge: Could develop a machine that shrinks the ship, or that makes Donut gigantic! Or both.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.220
Simmons: Or we could try digging underneath the hull.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.220
Sarge: I've got it! A levitation ray. I think I have a spare in the base! I'll be right back.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.680
Simmons: But Sir!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.640
Sarge: Simmons there's no time to chat about your crackpot theories! (gets in the Warthog)

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.320
This is a crisis situation. Time to save us all, with science.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.840
Sarge: Pshew! Off.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.840
Grif: Uhf, Sage just drove away with our jack, didn't he.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.040
Simmons: And our shovels. Sometimes I'm amazed our entire platoon hasn't starved to death.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.940
Church: What the fuck are you guys doing out here, breaking the canyon?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.540
Grif: Fuhuck off, Blue. A ship just crashed on one of our guys.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.680
Church: What, this ship?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.800
Simmons: No, another ship. Then that ship left, and this ship crashed in the exact same spot.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.020
Church: Where'd it come from?

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.960
Grif: It's a spaceship, it came from space.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.900
...

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.400
Church: Dibs.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.920
Simmons: What?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.160
Church: Dibs. I just called dibs. This is my ship now. Dibs.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.780
Simmons: No it isn't, jackass, we found it first.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.440
Church: Yeah but you didn't call dibs. I did. Dibs. See?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.820
Grif: You can't call dibs on a spaceship! That's ridiculous.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.540
Church: Heh, yes I can. Dibs- see? I just did it again. Now, get the fuck away from my ship, tomato can.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.460
Simmons: Don't call me tomato can.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.640
Grif: Try and take it then.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.780
Church: Um ... okay. Sheila?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.080
Sheila: You bet.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.100
Grif: Fuck! You forgot about that too, didn't you.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.960
Simmons: Yeah, kinda.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.540
Sheila: Now step away from the ship, tomato can.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.760
Grif: Ha ha, tomato can.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.000
Sheila: You too, lemon head.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.780
Grif: Hey I'm orange, not yellow!

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.460
Sheila: (in a weird voice) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
