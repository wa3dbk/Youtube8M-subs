00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
alright guys so the first step in making

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.120 
alright guys so the first step in making
the<00:00:03.240> Train<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.780> we<00:00:03.929> need<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.230> create<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.620> file

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
the Train is we need to create a file

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.120 
the Train is we need to create a file
folder<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.879> desktop<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.080> Train<00:00:07.350> so

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
folder on the desktop for the Train so

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.919 
folder on the desktop for the Train so
right<00:00:08.429> click<00:00:08.700> somewhere<00:00:08.940> on<00:00:09.150> your<00:00:09.420> desktop

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
right click somewhere on your desktop

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.689 
right click somewhere on your desktop
and<00:00:10.260> pick<00:00:11.250> new<00:00:13.070> folder<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.370> name<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.790> train

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
and pick new folder and name it train

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.550 
and pick new folder and name it train
all<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:18.150> files<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.230> here

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
all of your files have to go in here

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
all of your files have to go in here
otherwise<00:00:20.400> you're<00:00:20.640> gonna<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> hard<00:00:21.270> time

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
otherwise you're gonna have a hard time

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
otherwise you're gonna have a hard time
assembling<00:00:22.050> your<00:00:22.080> train<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.310> sure<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
assembling your train and make sure you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.179 
assembling your train and make sure you
name<00:00:23.939> them<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:24.750> actually<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.949> it's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
name them what they actually are or it's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.890 
name them what they actually are or it's
going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.460> pretty<00:00:27.029> difficult<00:00:27.269> down<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
going to be pretty difficult down the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.710 
going to be pretty difficult down the
road<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.279> open<00:00:29.640> inventor<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.599> I'm

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
road so then I open inventor and I'm

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.950 
road so then I open inventor and I'm
gonna<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> train<00:00:31.470> body<00:00:31.830> first<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:32.960> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
gonna do the train body first then you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
gonna do the train body first then you
go<00:00:34.079> standard<00:00:34.590> IPT<00:00:35.190> create<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.980> train<00:00:47.219> body

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
go standard IPT create the train body

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
go standard IPT create the train body
only<00:00:47.760> has<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> guys

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
only has one thing on it that you guys

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
only has one thing on it that you guys
really<00:00:50.039> haven't<00:00:50.219> done<00:00:50.520> yet<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
really haven't done yet and that is a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.459 
really haven't done yet and that is a
work<00:00:52.050> plane<00:00:52.760> but<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> rest<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.420> just

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
work plane but the rest of it is just

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.299 
work plane but the rest of it is just
tangents<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> curves<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.399> holes<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
tangents and curves and holes so like I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.440 
tangents and curves and holes so like I
do<00:01:02.370> when<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.670> start<00:01:02.730> any<00:01:03.120> drawing<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.899> home<00:01:04.199> I

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
do when I start any drawing I go home I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
do when I start any drawing I go home I
open<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> origin<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> draw

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
open up the origin and I'm going to draw

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.429 
open up the origin and I'm going to draw
on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> Y<00:01:08.760> Z<00:01:09.090> plane<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.409> side

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
on the Y Z plane which is the right side

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.270 
on the Y Z plane which is the right side
view<00:01:12.560> I'm<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.710> create<00:01:13.979> 2d<00:01:14.490> sketch<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
view I'm gonna create 2d sketch and I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
view I'm gonna create 2d sketch and I
don't<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.520> why<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> flips<00:01:18.119> itself<00:01:18.509> around<00:01:18.840> so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
don't know why it flips itself around so

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.630 
don't know why it flips itself around so
I'm<00:01:19.439> gonna<00:01:19.560> correct<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
I'm gonna correct that and I'm going to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.740 
I'm gonna correct that and I'm going to
draw<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.630> L<00:01:24.869> shape<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.590> creates<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.750> body

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
draw the L shape that creates the body

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.670 
draw the L shape that creates the body
of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> train

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.830 

now<00:01:38.680> I'm<00:01:38.829> going<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.040> dimension<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.329> overall

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
now I'm going to dimension the overall

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.600 
now I'm going to dimension the overall
dimension<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.470> this<00:01:41.619> thing<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.100> five<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.549> a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
dimension of this thing is five and a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.660 
dimension of this thing is five and a
half<00:01:42.820> five<00:01:43.299> point<00:01:43.600> five<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:45.310> ginormous

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
half five point five and it's ginormous

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.160 
half five point five and it's ginormous
so<00:01:46.299> I'm<00:01:46.390> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.630> use<00:01:46.810> my<00:01:47.340> zoom<00:01:48.340> all<00:01:49.170> right

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
so I'm going to use my zoom all right

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.279 
so I'm going to use my zoom all right
there<00:01:50.409> which<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.770> magnifier<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:52.289> that'll

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
there which is the magnifier and that'll

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.499 
there which is the magnifier and that'll
help<00:01:53.439> me<00:01:53.530> out<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:56.020> height<00:01:56.320> of<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:57.509> front

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
help me out the height of this front

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:07.830 
help me out the height of this front
piece<00:01:58.840> is<00:02:01.890> 0.875<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:06.789> that's<00:02:07.119> buried<00:02:07.659> in

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
piece is 0.875 and that's buried in

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.229 
piece is 0.875 and that's buried in
those<00:02:07.990> dimensions<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.039> front<00:02:09.700> view<00:02:09.970> there

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
those dimensions on the front view there

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.340 
those dimensions on the front view there
and<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.950> back<00:02:12.220> dimension<00:02:12.970> here<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:14.019> have<00:02:14.170> to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
and the back dimension here you have to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.020 
and the back dimension here you have to
turn<00:02:14.560> your<00:02:14.769> paper<00:02:15.010> over<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.610> look<00:02:15.760> at<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
turn your paper over and look at the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.770 
turn your paper over and look at the
back<00:02:16.299> view<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.459> Train<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:19.420> figure<00:02:19.630> out

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
back view of the Train to figure out

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.900 
back view of the Train to figure out
what<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.080> dimension<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.950> we're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.790> to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
what that dimension is we're going to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.350 
what that dimension is we're going to
add<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:23.250> distance<00:02:24.250> from<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.700> bottom<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.209> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
add the distance from the bottom of the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.550 
add the distance from the bottom of the
train<00:02:25.630> which<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.190> 0.375<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.989> largest

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
train which is 0.375 to that largest

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.070 
train which is 0.375 to that largest
radius<00:02:29.920> an<00:02:30.280> inventor<00:02:31.060> will<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> math<00:02:31.690> for

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
radius an inventor will do the math for

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:43.470 
radius an inventor will do the math for
you<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.500> let<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:40.170> okay<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.380> that's<00:02:42.120> two<00:02:43.120> point

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
you so let it okay and that's two point

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.949 
you so let it okay and that's two point
seven<00:02:43.989> two<00:02:44.170> five<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.000> then<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.239> dimension

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
seven two five and then this dimension

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.490 
seven two five and then this dimension
here<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.650> again<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.250> front<00:02:48.670> view<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.500> it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
here is again on the front view and it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.610 
here is again on the front view and it
is<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:52.150> point<00:02:52.390> seven<00:02:52.720> five<00:02:53.049> it's<00:02:53.350> kind<00:02:53.560> of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
is one point seven five it's kind of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.289 
is one point seven five it's kind of
buried<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.160> at<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.549> bottom<00:02:54.940> which<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.269> a

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
buried in at the bottom which is a

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.220 
buried in at the bottom which is a
really<00:02:55.570> bad<00:02:55.810> place<00:02:56.079> for<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:57.130> know<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
really bad place for it but you know and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.370 
really bad place for it but you know and
now<00:02:59.380> we're<00:02:59.440> gonna<00:02:59.650> finish<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.340> sketch<00:03:01.380> I'm

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
now we're gonna finish the sketch I'm

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.770 
now we're gonna finish the sketch I'm
going<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.769> once<00:03:03.430> again<00:03:03.549> zoom<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.660> I'm

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
going to once again zoom all and I'm

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.140 
going to once again zoom all and I'm
going<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.959> extrude<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.890> entire<00:03:06.280> width<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
going to extrude the entire width of the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.800 
going to extrude the entire width of the
train<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.950> entire<00:03:09.069> depth<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.209> suppose<00:03:10.630> I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
train the entire depth I suppose I

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.890 
train the entire depth I suppose I
should<00:03:10.989> say<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:12.209> -<00:03:15.120> okay<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.510> there's<00:03:16.720> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
should say is - okay so there's the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.110 
should say is - okay so there's the
l-shape<00:03:17.500> now<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.739> have<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.250> cylinder<00:03:18.700> that's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
l-shape now I have this cylinder that's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.870 
l-shape now I have this cylinder that's
kind<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.420> stuck<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.870> top<00:03:20.109> of<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.459> I'm<00:03:21.760> gonna

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
kind of stuck on top of it so I'm gonna

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.509 
kind of stuck on top of it so I'm gonna
put<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.180> 3d<00:03:22.600> sketch<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.109> this<00:03:23.410> surface<00:03:23.519> it's

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
put a 3d sketch on this surface it's

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.970 
put a 3d sketch on this surface it's
gonna<00:03:24.639> make<00:03:24.880> my<00:03:25.030> life<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.389> lot<00:03:25.569> easier<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.799> Dees

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
gonna make my life a lot easier to Dees

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.460 
gonna make my life a lot easier to Dees
catch<00:03:27.310> create<00:03:27.850> 2d<00:03:28.239> sketch<00:03:28.540> right<00:03:28.870> there<00:03:29.109> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
catch create 2d sketch right there and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.120 
catch create 2d sketch right there and
now<00:03:29.920> I'm<00:03:30.040> gonna<00:03:30.160> draw<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> circle<00:03:31.889> remember<00:03:32.889> if

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
now I'm gonna draw a circle remember if

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.770 
now I'm gonna draw a circle remember if
you<00:03:33.220> draw<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> circle<00:03:33.579> and<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.150> put<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.450> center

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
you draw a circle and you put the center

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.970 
you draw a circle and you put the center
point<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.350> line<00:03:35.530> it's<00:03:35.859> gonna

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
point on the line it's gonna

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.890 
point on the line it's gonna
automatically<00:03:36.670> constrain<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.480> there<00:03:37.660> and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
automatically constrain it there and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.090 
automatically constrain it there and
that's<00:03:38.049> going<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.350> make<00:03:38.470> your<00:03:38.620> life<00:03:38.829> difficult

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
that's going to make your life difficult

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.509 
that's going to make your life difficult
so<00:03:39.639> don't<00:03:39.819> do<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.120> draw<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.079> like<00:03:41.290> out<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
so don't do that draw it like out in the

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.590 
so don't do that draw it like out in the
middle<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.790> nowhere<00:03:42.940> where<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.359> know<00:03:43.540> you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
middle of nowhere where you know you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.409 
middle of nowhere where you know you
don't<00:03:43.840> want<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:45.430> diameter<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.239> this

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
don't want it the diameter of this

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.680 
don't want it the diameter of this
circle<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:47.970> well<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> radius

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
circle is well the radius

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.800 
circle is well the radius
point<00:03:49.960> seven<00:03:50.380> five<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.550> can<00:03:51.760> put<00:03:52.000> star<00:03:52.420> two

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
point seven five and I can put star two

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.110 
point seven five and I can put star two
if<00:03:53.080> I<00:03:53.200> don't<00:03:53.380> want<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> do<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.920> math<00:03:54.100> which<00:03:54.940> is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
if I don't want to do the math which is

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.170 
if I don't want to do the math which is
one<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.510> half<00:03:55.950> from<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.280> line<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
one and a half from this line to the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.730 
one and a half from this line to the
center<00:03:58.630> point<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.320> circle<00:03:59.730> is<00:04:01.380> one<00:04:02.380> point

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
center point of the circle is one point

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.590 
center point of the circle is one point
three<00:04:02.950> seven<00:04:03.460> five<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.670> again<00:04:04.120> that's<00:04:04.330> on<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
three seven five and again that's on the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.020 
three seven five and again that's on the
front<00:04:04.870> view<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.320> train<00:04:05.590> dragged<00:04:06.490> all<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
front view of the train dragged all the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.030 
front view of the train dragged all the
way<00:04:07.150> out<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:08.490> this<00:04:09.490> guy<00:04:09.760> sits<00:04:10.270> in<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.570> middle

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
way out and this guy sits in the middle

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.310 
way out and this guy sits in the middle
so<00:04:12.040> we're<00:04:12.190> gonna<00:04:12.280> change<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.910> one<00:04:13.330> and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
so we're gonna change that to one and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.120 
so we're gonna change that to one and
now<00:04:14.650> if<00:04:14.800> I<00:04:14.890> look<00:04:15.160> at<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:17.500> how<00:04:17.680> it's<00:04:17.890> going

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
now if I look at this see how it's going

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.820 
now if I look at this see how it's going
to<00:04:18.280> connect<00:04:18.670> this<00:04:19.170> circle<00:04:20.170> to<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:20.530> drawing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
to connect this circle to this drawing

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.570 
to connect this circle to this drawing
so<00:04:21.010> I'm<00:04:21.250> going<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.430> go<00:04:21.549> finish<00:04:21.910> sketch<00:04:23.580> I'm

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
so I'm going to go finish sketch I'm

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.150 
so I'm going to go finish sketch I'm
going<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.820> extrude<00:04:25.420> I'm<00:04:25.960> going<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.380> flip<00:04:26.890> the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
going to extrude I'm going to flip the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.920 
going to extrude I'm going to flip the
way<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:27.490> extruding<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.270> want<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.540> go<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.780> that

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
way it's extruding I want it go in that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.680 
way it's extruding I want it go in that
way<00:04:29.080> but<00:04:29.140> I<00:04:29.320> don't<00:04:29.650> want<00:04:29.920> it<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.190> cut<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.600> I'm

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
way but I don't want it to cut and I'm

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.740 
way but I don't want it to cut and I'm
gonna<00:04:31.810> change<00:04:32.170> this<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.770> two<00:04:32.980> necks<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:34.600> it

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
gonna change this to two necks so it

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.740 
gonna change this to two necks so it
connects<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:37.210> back<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.660> I've

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
connects to the the back that I've

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.900 
connects to the the back that I've
already<00:04:37.870> drawn<00:04:39.600> okay<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.460> there<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.670> the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
already drawn okay and there is the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.600 
already drawn okay and there is the
front<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.600> train<00:04:43.870> with<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.170> little

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
front of the train with the little

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.910 
front of the train with the little
rounded<00:04:45.610> part<00:04:45.820> on<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.350> now<00:04:47.350> we're<00:04:47.530> gonna<00:04:47.620> do

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
rounded part on it now we're gonna do

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.940 
rounded part on it now we're gonna do
this<00:04:48.070> cut<00:04:48.850> out<00:04:49.000> here<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:50.140> I'm<00:04:50.200> gonna<00:04:50.320> do<00:04:50.560> create

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
this cut out here so I'm gonna do create

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.909 
this cut out here so I'm gonna do create
2d<00:04:51.370> sketch<00:04:51.700> over<00:04:52.120> here<00:04:52.420> I'm<00:04:53.410> gonna<00:04:53.590> draw<00:04:53.890> a

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
2d sketch over here I'm gonna draw a

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.120 
2d sketch over here I'm gonna draw a
circle<00:04:54.450> once<00:04:55.450> again<00:04:55.780> don't<00:04:56.110> let<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.410> touch

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
circle once again don't let it touch

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.530 
circle once again don't let it touch
anything<00:04:57.460> or<00:04:57.820> it's<00:04:57.940> gonna<00:04:58.030> make<00:04:58.240> your<00:04:58.390> life

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
anything or it's gonna make your life

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.260 
anything or it's gonna make your life
difficult<00:04:59.100> the<00:05:00.100> diameter<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:01.090> circle<00:05:01.500> is

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
difficult the diameter of this circle is

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.090 
difficult the diameter of this circle is
the<00:05:04.270> radius<00:05:04.630> is<00:05:04.840> 0.5<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:05.770> times<00:05:06.580> 2<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.150> 1<00:05:08.100> from

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
the radius is 0.5 so times 2 is 1 from

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.370 
the radius is 0.5 so times 2 is 1 from
the<00:05:09.280> bottom<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.190> center<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.090> circle

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
the bottom to the center of the circle

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.150 
the bottom to the center of the circle
is<00:05:15.600> 1.75<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:18.900> from<00:05:19.900> this<00:05:20.140> line<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.980> center

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
is 1.75 and from this line to the center

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.020 
is 1.75 and from this line to the center
of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> circle

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
of the circle

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.830 
of the circle
it's<00:05:22.740> 0.25<00:05:23.740> so<00:05:24.550> now<00:05:24.700> notice<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.120> my<00:05:25.419> circle

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
it's 0.25 so now notice that my circle

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.930 
it's 0.25 so now notice that my circle
kind<00:05:26.080> of<00:05:26.169> hangs<00:05:26.470> out<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.100> that's<00:05:27.640> what<00:05:27.790> we

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
kind of hangs out and that's what we

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.520 
kind of hangs out and that's what we
want<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.330> do<00:05:28.630> but<00:05:28.870> if<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.110> look<00:05:29.260> at<00:05:29.410> the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
want it to do but if you look at the

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.990 
want it to do but if you look at the
drawing<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:30.070> doesn't<00:05:30.400> really<00:05:30.550> look<00:05:30.790> like<00:05:30.850> a

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
drawing it doesn't really look like a

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.680 
drawing it doesn't really look like a
circle<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.690> looks<00:05:31.960> like<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.380> like<00:05:32.980> a<00:05:33.010> D<00:05:33.510> so<00:05:34.510> what

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
circle it looks like a like a D so what

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.480 
circle it looks like a like a D so what
do<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.840> think<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.169> means<00:05:35.380> means<00:05:36.160> we<00:05:36.340> need

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
do you think that means means we need

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.870 
do you think that means means we need
tangent<00:05:37.090> lines<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:37.840> I'm<00:05:37.930> gonna<00:05:38.050> draw<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.410> line

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
tangent lines so I'm gonna draw a line

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.090 
tangent lines so I'm gonna draw a line
and<00:05:39.880> if<00:05:40.330> I<00:05:40.480> get<00:05:40.780> up<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.169> top<00:05:41.500> there<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.950> see

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
and if I get up to the top there you see

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.170 
and if I get up to the top there you see
how<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.280> get<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.610> tangent<00:05:42.880> symbol<00:05:43.570> right<00:05:44.260> there

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
how I get the tangent symbol right there

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.900 
how I get the tangent symbol right there
good<00:05:46.320> do<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.470> same<00:05:47.650> thing<00:05:47.890> down<00:05:48.070> here<00:05:48.490> make

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
good do the same thing down here make

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.750 
good do the same thing down here make
sure<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.210> get<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.510> tangent<00:05:50.050> symbol<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:51.610> now

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
sure you get that tangent symbol and now

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.400 
sure you get that tangent symbol and now
we're<00:05:51.910> going<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.060> trim<00:05:52.419> away<00:05:52.540> this<00:05:52.900> part<00:05:53.200> of

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
we're going to trim away this part of

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.950 
we're going to trim away this part of
the<00:05:53.500> circle<00:05:53.860> click<00:05:54.220> on<00:05:54.400> trim<00:05:54.790> click<00:05:55.720> this

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
the circle click on trim click this

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.010 
the circle click on trim click this
click<00:05:56.680> these<00:05:56.890> little<00:05:57.250> ends<00:05:57.550> so<00:05:58.479> it<00:05:58.660> looks<00:05:58.870> like

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
click these little ends so it looks like

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.370 
click these little ends so it looks like
a<00:05:59.169> D<00:05:59.979> kind<00:06:00.910> of<00:06:01.000> facing<00:06:01.360> backwards<00:06:01.810> as<00:06:02.020> opposed

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
a D kind of facing backwards as opposed

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.420 
a D kind of facing backwards as opposed
to<00:06:02.530> a

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
to a

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.790 
to a
an<00:06:03.490> actual<00:06:04.060> circle<00:06:04.449> I'm<00:06:05.050> going<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.320> finish<00:06:05.470> the

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
an actual circle I'm going to finish the

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.080 
an actual circle I'm going to finish the
sketch<00:06:06.660> extrude<00:06:07.660> with<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.900> cut<00:06:08.970> extents<00:06:09.970> is

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
sketch extrude with a cut extents is

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:18.180 
sketch extrude with a cut extents is
going<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.330> be<00:06:10.479> all<00:06:12.300> tell<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.449> okay<00:06:16.680> okay<00:06:17.680> so<00:06:17.860> now

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
going to be all tell it okay okay so now

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.159 
going to be all tell it okay okay so now
I<00:06:18.220> need<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.520> put<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.970> arc<00:06:19.240> on<00:06:19.509> the<00:06:19.570> back<00:06:19.930> of

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
I need to put the arc on the back of

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.740 
I need to put the arc on the back of
this<00:06:20.289> thing<00:06:20.350> so<00:06:20.949> I'm<00:06:21.699> going<00:06:21.880> to<00:06:21.940> create<00:06:22.150> a<00:06:22.300> 2d

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
this thing so I'm going to create a 2d

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.469 
this thing so I'm going to create a 2d
sketch<00:06:23.080> down<00:06:23.410> here<00:06:23.919> but<00:06:24.699> notice<00:06:24.880> how<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.300> only

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
sketch down here but notice how it only

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.260 
sketch down here but notice how it only
turns<00:06:25.900> this<00:06:26.199> part<00:06:26.560> green<00:06:26.949> I<00:06:27.340> want<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.060> be<00:06:28.150> able

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
turns this part green I want to be able

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.890 
turns this part green I want to be able
to<00:06:28.449> use<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.080> corners<00:06:29.830> of<00:06:30.039> this<00:06:30.490> up<00:06:31.000> top<00:06:31.630> as

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
to use the the corners of this up top as

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.200 
to use the the corners of this up top as
well<00:06:32.139> so<00:06:32.889> I'm<00:06:32.979> going<00:06:33.100> to<00:06:33.190> go<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.370> up<00:06:33.820> here

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
well so I'm going to go to up here

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.850 
well so I'm going to go to up here
what's<00:06:34.389> this<00:06:34.509> project<00:06:34.960> geometry<00:06:35.560> pick

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
what's this project geometry pick

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.340 
what's this project geometry pick
project<00:06:36.460> cut<00:06:36.760> edges<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.419> now<00:06:37.870> you'll<00:06:38.020> see<00:06:38.199> how

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
project cut edges and now you'll see how

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.590 
project cut edges and now you'll see how
it<00:06:38.440> outlines<00:06:38.830> everything<00:06:39.280> in<00:06:39.580> green<00:06:39.850> so<00:06:40.360> I<00:06:40.389> can

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
it outlines everything in green so I can

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.320 
it outlines everything in green so I can
actually<00:06:40.780> measure<00:06:41.169> to<00:06:41.500> those<00:06:41.680> spots<00:06:42.330> I'm

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
actually measure to those spots I'm

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.360 
actually measure to those spots I'm
gonna<00:06:43.479> click<00:06:43.750> circle<00:06:44.320> and<00:06:44.740> I'm<00:06:44.949> going<00:06:45.100> to<00:06:45.160> draw

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
gonna click circle and I'm going to draw

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.279 
gonna click circle and I'm going to draw
a<00:06:45.430> circle<00:06:45.850> remember<00:06:46.479> don't<00:06:46.690> let<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:47.080> touch

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
a circle remember don't let it touch

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.050 
a circle remember don't let it touch
something<00:06:47.680> and<00:06:48.070> don't<00:06:48.520> draw<00:06:48.760> it<00:06:48.789> in<00:06:48.940> the

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
something and don't draw it in the

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.670 
something and don't draw it in the
middle<00:06:49.300> because<00:06:49.479> it<00:06:49.750> will<00:06:49.870> always<00:06:50.020> constrain

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
middle because it will always constrain

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.200 
middle because it will always constrain
to<00:06:50.830> what<00:06:50.979> you<00:06:51.070> don't<00:06:51.250> want<00:06:51.520> it<00:06:51.639> to<00:06:51.729> constrain

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
to what you don't want it to constrain

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.680 
to what you don't want it to constrain
to<00:06:53.160> I'm<00:06:54.160> gonna<00:06:54.340> put<00:06:54.580> in<00:06:54.669> the<00:06:54.820> diameter<00:06:55.419> I<00:06:55.599> know

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690
