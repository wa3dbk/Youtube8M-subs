let's try I'm in raising here see how

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
let's try I'm in raising here see how
this<00:01:28.049> works<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.680> us<00:01:29.030> looks<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this works out for us looks like the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.170 
this works out for us looks like the
answer<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.820> gonna<00:01:32.939> win

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
answer is not well and you're gonna win

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.649 
answer is not well and you're gonna win
track<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.170> Deuce<00:01:35.390> then<00:01:36.390> we're<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
track and Deuce then we're going to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.010 
track and Deuce then we're going to
start<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> limp<00:01:38.270> again<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.479> mean<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
start here with a limp again I mean I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.780 
start here with a limp again I mean I
wonder<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.710> he's<00:01:40.799> gonna<00:01:40.890> raise<00:01:41.159> every<00:01:41.490> single

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
wonder if he's gonna raise every single

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.300 
wonder if he's gonna raise every single
time<00:01:42.000> looks<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> answer<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.110> no<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.590> think

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
time looks like the answer is no I think

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.410 
time looks like the answer is no I think
we're<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> start<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> bet<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
we're going to start here at the bet on

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
we're going to start here at the bet on
the<00:01:45.509> flop<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.229> amazing<00:01:46.470> situation<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.460> us

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the flop not an amazing situation for us

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
the flop not an amazing situation for us
but<00:01:47.909> maybe<00:01:48.299> he'll<00:01:48.570> fold<00:01:49.579> hmm<00:01:51.560> ace<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.799> an

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
but maybe he'll fold hmm ace is an

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.469 
but maybe he'll fold hmm ace is an
interesting<00:01:53.070> card<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.180> started

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
interesting card here think we started

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.609 
interesting card here think we started
the<00:01:54.509> check<00:01:54.780> he's<00:01:54.990> probably<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> check

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the check he's probably going to check

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.149 
the check he's probably going to check
back<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.899> do<00:01:57.899> beat<00:01:58.170> some<00:01:58.439> hands<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> river

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
hands I mean if he has a seven he could

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.480 
hands I mean if he has a seven he could
play<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> seven<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.430> a
