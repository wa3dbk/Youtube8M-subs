00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.330
 Let's meet some of this car. 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.809
 engine that hyundai has put in this version 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.849
 which is the only version sold in Brazil 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.600
 also without options is a car that comes 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.990
 pro already full factory without any 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 optional item a single package in this case 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 In this car we have a 2.0 engine of 16 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.940
 valves that yields 178 horses with 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.890
 ethanol and 169 with gasoline 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.000
 the exchange rate is an automatic 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.550
 four gears is well-spaced from the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 agility the car a car that weighs 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 1,500 kilograms empty with all fluids 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 and full tank 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.920

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 of that car 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 taking advantage of the hook here let's look at the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 luggage compartment 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.090

 steppe monkey wheel in company 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.380
 in the compartment just below this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 door coat 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.780
 so it makes the security issue easier to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.049
 a clothing issue or else we have a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.450
 to run up to 80 kilometers per hour 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.560
 470 liters of the trunk enough 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.170
 we have that coating 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 retractable luggage carrier also sings from the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.119
 privacy to the owner who has 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.619

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.640
 this accessory that is a network in the network 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.149
 of the trunk to ensure small 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.900
 objects and thus avoiding noise and 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.630
 damage to the side of the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.300
 of the trunk in order to finally score 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.480
 spoil some of the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.480

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.370
