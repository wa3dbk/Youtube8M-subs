00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello girls in this video I talk to you 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:17.869
 of the color of beauty space nails that 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.690
 have this jar here yes I have to 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.019
 to say that they are not loaded like therefore 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.630
 they are not opaque like those of Milan 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.490
 some are more, some less though 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:37.450
 you can can go here let's get started 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:51.980
 from this that is raspberry and the number 85 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:54.289
 00 02 and this is a ride for 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.410
 side 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.510
 yes I have to say that I am so here 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:16.750
 liquids as you can see are 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:16.750
 then the 8500 25 rich cinnamon oil 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.750
 this one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.720
 take what they are and so these yes 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.050
 I must say that they are very beautiful 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 here they are preferred a little more dense 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:49.340
 however, this is fine then aquarium 85000 6 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:58.650
 here yes I must say that when I spread it e 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:03.530
 almost transparent with a pass 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.530
 with three they say he takes 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.420
 obviously this one 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:33.310
 we 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:37.390
 8500 rust 16 this red 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.310
 all of them are the ones I have 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:49.420
 maybe even for what they are like that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:49.420
 so I don't know they are still very beautiful 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:04.550
 then sand 8500 19 which resembles a torch 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.660
 a little clearer this yes we say it is 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.500
 it went quite very nice indeed 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.500
 it looks like sand 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:38.690
 then pink which is 8500 22 and I thought 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:46.060
 were it so instead then mixing it 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.060
 becomes a not pink gray pink 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 you see 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:22.109
 then silver that number 85 00 08 e 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:28.130
 this also does not look like it 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:31.130
 silver looks like an olive green 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.130
 transparent 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:43.830
 also this however is not very covering 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:53.520
 I have to do two three passes to get it 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:58.430
 have a decent color then or in black 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.250
 this is a very opaque 8500 09 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:08.160
 with a pass this, too, for 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:15.570
 very liquid side but very nice 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:25.740
 I like this now and then, finally, or 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:30.870
 the oil 850 007 that this much 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:35.900
 very nice also this very opaque 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.900
 I don't know why others are like that 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:50.210
 and none of these are my colored 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.199
 beauty space names I hope the video will 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.020
 both liked it 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.020
 a kiss to the next hello
