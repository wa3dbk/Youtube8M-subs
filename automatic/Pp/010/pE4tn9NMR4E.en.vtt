free sdk tutorial series and in this
video<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.290> covering<00:00:07.710> something

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
video I'm going to be covering something

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.570 
video I'm going to be covering something
which<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.030> very<00:00:09.090> long<00:00:10.019> waited<00:00:10.590> which<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
which is very long waited which is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.419 
which is very long waited which is
artificial<00:00:12.330> intelligence<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.559> think<00:00:14.219> those<00:00:14.309> in

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
artificial intelligence I think those in

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.340 
artificial intelligence I think those in
one<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.549> my<00:00:14.639> previous<00:00:14.790> videos<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.630> went<00:00:16.020> over<00:00:16.289> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
one of my previous videos I went over a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.529 
one of my previous videos I went over a
bunch<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.619> different<00:00:16.920> entities<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.300> did

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
bunch of different entities and I did

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.480 
bunch of different entities and I did
promise<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.960> go<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.320> AI<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.039> little<00:00:20.310> more

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
promise to go into AI in a little more

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.840 
promise to go into AI in a little more
detail<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.630> basically<00:00:22.340> play<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.580> one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
detail and just basically play with one

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
detail and just basically play with one
so<00:00:24.600> first<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.289> let's<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:26.220> go<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.490> find

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so first of all let's just go and find

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730 
so first of all let's just go and find
where<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.840> madnesses<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
where they are so to do madnesses go to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.540 
where they are so to do madnesses go to
entities<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:29.699> under<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.439> AI<00:00:31.439> tab<00:00:31.949> we've

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
entities and then under the AI tab we've

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
entities and then under the AI tab we've
got<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> few<00:00:33.030> different<00:00:33.180> types<00:00:33.630> we're<00:00:34.230> only

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

entities<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.430> hell<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.360> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
entities you have a hell of a lot of

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.120 
entities you have a hell of a lot of
different<00:02:03.540> parameters<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.920> play

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
different parameters that you can play

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.490 
different parameters that you can play
around<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.759> we've<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:06.600> things<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.229> auto

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
around with we've got things like auto

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.740 
around with we've got things like auto
disabled<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.030> essentially<00:02:09.450> just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
disabled so you can essentially just

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
disabled so you can essentially just
hide<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.129> doesn't<00:02:11.160> turn<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
hide it so it doesn't turn so it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.230 
hide it so it doesn't turn so it's
pretty<00:02:12.209> much<00:02:12.330> hidden

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
pretty much hidden

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.690 
pretty much hidden
you've<00:02:13.900> got<00:02:14.020> loads<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.350> others<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:15.010> yeah<00:02:15.310> or

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you've got loads of others but yeah or

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.280 
you've got loads of others but yeah or
to<00:02:15.850> disable<00:02:15.940> let's<00:02:16.540> say<00:02:16.690> you've<00:02:16.870> got<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> pack

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
to disable let's say you've got a pack

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500 
to disable let's say you've got a pack
of<00:02:17.500> them<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.700> want<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> use<00:02:19.180> one<00:02:19.210> for

of them I just want to use one for

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.030 
of them I just want to use one for
testing<00:02:19.900> purposes<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.680> hide<00:02:20.860> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
testing purposes you can just hide it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.530 
testing purposes you can just hide it
citizen<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> should<00:02:21.580> come<00:02:21.730> off<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.000> game<00:02:22.180> blah

of<00:02:44.110> stuff<00:02:44.400> also<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.000> very<00:02:46.180> top<00:02:46.480> up<00:02:46.720> here

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
of stuff also at the very top up here

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.780 
of stuff also at the very top up here
we've<00:02:47.590> got<00:02:47.620> some<00:02:47.890> more<00:02:48.040> parameters<00:02:48.580> we<00:02:48.670> can

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
we've got some more parameters we can

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.450 
we've got some more parameters we can
play<00:02:48.970> around<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.420> we've<00:02:50.050> got<00:02:50.380> outdoor<00:02:51.040> only

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
play around with we've got outdoor only

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.330 
play around with we've got outdoor only
which<00:02:51.640> means<00:02:52.000> he<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:53.200> only<00:02:53.560> stay<00:02:53.920> outside<00:02:54.070> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
which means he can only stay outside you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.700 
which means he can only stay outside you
can't<00:02:54.520> go<00:02:54.670> inside<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.000> buildings<00:02:55.290> cast<00:02:56.290> shadow

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
can't go inside of buildings cast shadow

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.130 
can't go inside of buildings cast shadow
it's<00:02:57.070> pretty<00:02:57.310> self-explanatory<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:58.480> when<00:02:59.110> i

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
it's pretty self-explanatory but when i

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
it's pretty self-explanatory but when i
turn<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.620> off<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.770> on<00:03:01.050> yeah<00:03:02.050> okay<00:03:02.590> so<00:03:02.650> cast

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
turn it off and on yeah okay so cast

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.070 
turn it off and on yeah okay so cast
shadow<00:03:03.460> false<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.690> should<00:03:05.020> be<00:03:05.050> off<00:03:05.380> when<00:03:05.800> I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
shadow false it should be off when I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.260 
shadow false it should be off when I
generate<00:03:08.080> all<00:03:08.260> AI<00:03:08.560> however<00:03:09.190> sometimes<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:10.120> few

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
generate all AI however sometimes a few

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.350 
generate all AI however sometimes a few
bugs<00:03:10.540> with<00:03:10.780> AI<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.320> just<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.880> takes<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.180> few

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
bugs with AI and just it takes a few

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.150 
bugs with AI and just it takes a few
times<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:14.050> actually<00:03:14.680> show<00:03:14.920> up<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:17.160> that's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
times to actually show up so that's

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.950 
times to actually show up so that's
pretty<00:03:18.370> much<00:03:18.550> all<00:03:18.790> i<00:03:18.850> really<00:03:19.120> wanted<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.630> go

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
pretty much all i really wanted to go

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.440 
pretty much all i really wanted to go
over<00:03:19.990> in<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.350> video<00:03:20.740> we've<00:03:21.040> got<00:03:21.280> our<00:03:21.610> AI<00:03:21.940> up

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
over in this video we've got our AI up

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.920 
over in this video we've got our AI up
and<00:03:22.630> going<00:03:22.960> he<00:03:23.590> shoots<00:03:23.980> us<00:03:24.340> he<00:03:24.520> attacks<00:03:24.880> us<00:03:25.180> we

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
and going he shoots us he attacks us we

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.390 
and going he shoots us he attacks us we
played<00:03:26.380> around<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.950> few<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.280> different

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
played around a few of the different

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.300 
played around a few of the different
parameters<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.480> we<00:03:28.780> should<00:03:29.110> be<00:03:29.650> able<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:30.130> do

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
parameters and we should be able to do

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.600 
parameters and we should be able to do
stuff<00:03:30.670> also<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:31.930> wanted<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.650> apologize
