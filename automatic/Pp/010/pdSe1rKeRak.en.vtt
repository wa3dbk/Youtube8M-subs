pilots<00:00:25.250> are<00:00:25.370> making<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.820> transition<00:00:26.240> into

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
pilots are making the transition into

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.779 
pilots are making the transition into
precision<00:00:26.960> as<00:00:27.260> well<00:00:27.440> snaps<00:00:28.250> are<00:00:28.520> very

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
precision as well snaps are very

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.250 
precision as well snaps are very
challenging<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.510> I<00:00:29.539> want<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.840> talk<00:00:30.020> to<00:00:30.170> you

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
challenging and I want to talk to you

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.740 
challenging and I want to talk to you
about<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.530> proper<00:00:30.890> technique<00:00:31.360> okay<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:32.450> tell

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
about the proper technique okay so tell

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.720 
about the proper technique okay so tell
me<00:00:32.780> where<00:00:33.020> do<00:00:33.080> we<00:00:33.170> start<00:00:33.410> first<00:00:34.220> we'll<00:00:34.550> talk

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
me where do we start first we'll talk

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.640 
me where do we start first we'll talk
about<00:00:34.879> how<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.150> do<00:00:35.390> a<00:00:35.420> legitimate<00:00:36.110> snap<00:00:36.379> and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
about how to do a legitimate snap and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.530 
about how to do a legitimate snap and
then<00:00:36.860> we'll<00:00:36.980> get<00:00:37.100> into<00:00:37.160> flying<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.910> snap<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:38.480> you

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
then we'll get into flying a snap so you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.960 
then we'll get into flying a snap so you
can<00:00:38.750> nail<00:00:38.960> them<00:00:39.080> every<00:00:39.379> time<00:00:39.530> sounds<00:00:40.520> great<00:00:40.699> go

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
can nail them every time sounds great go

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.930 
can nail them every time sounds great go

eighth of a turn to go the rudder is out

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.779 
eighth of a turn to go the rudder is out
the<00:01:21.170> aileron<00:01:21.619> comes<00:01:21.890> out<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.280> finish<00:01:22.579> on

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
the aileron comes out to finish on

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.910 
the aileron comes out to finish on
heading<00:01:23.390> add<00:01:24.399> altitude<00:01:25.399> wings<00:01:26.119> level<00:01:26.920> perfect

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
heading add altitude wings level perfect

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.810 
heading add altitude wings level perfect
and<00:01:28.780> now<00:01:29.780> again<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:30.320> little<00:01:30.619> bit<00:01:30.740> faster

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.820 

so<00:01:38.810> are<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:38.990> up<00:01:39.260> for<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.800> half

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
so are you up for a one and a half

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.600 
so are you up for a one and a half
smoking<00:01:40.400> Joe<00:01:40.570> bring<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.690> on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.660 

here<00:01:45.610> we<00:01:45.700> go<00:01:45.790> one<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.150> a<00:01:46.210> half<00:01:46.240> same<00:01:46.869> entry

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
here we go one and a half same entry

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.140 
here we go one and a half same entry
same<00:01:48.670> sticks<00:01:50.070> bounce<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.250> elevator<00:01:51.610> rudder

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
same sticks bounce the elevator rudder

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.149 
same sticks bounce the elevator rudder
aileron<00:01:52.690> we're<00:01:53.380> going<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> hold<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.130> little

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
aileron we're going to hold it a little

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.640 
aileron we're going to hold it a little
longer<00:01:54.520> rotate<00:01:55.330> again<00:01:55.810> at<00:01:56.200> about<00:01:56.440> an<00:01:56.530> eighth

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
longer rotate again at about an eighth

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.230 
longer rotate again at about an eighth
of<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.799> turn<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.100> go<00:01:57.220> release<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.030> rudder

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
of a turn to go release the rudder

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.660 
of a turn to go release the rudder

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.690 
okay Joe so I hate to state the obvious
but<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.080> aileron<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.980> rudder<00:02:39.160> do<00:02:39.430> go<00:02:39.580> in

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
but the aileron and the rudder do go in

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.030 
but the aileron and the rudder do go in
the<00:02:39.790> same<00:02:39.910> direction<00:02:40.200> that's<00:02:41.200> right<00:02:41.410> positive

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
the same direction that's right positive

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.440 
the same direction that's right positive
snap<00:02:42.280> we're<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.610> use<00:02:42.730> up<00:02:42.880> elevator

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
snap we're going to use up elevator

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.540 
snap we're going to use up elevator
rudder<00:02:44.230> an<00:02:44.440> aileron<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.190> same<00:02:45.400> direction

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
rudder an aileron go the same direction

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.790 
rudder an aileron go the same direction
and<00:02:46.090> then<00:02:46.720> when<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:46.900> get<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.140> negative<00:02:47.530> snaps

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
and then when we get to negative snaps

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.920 
and then when we get to negative snaps
it's<00:02:48.280> going<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.490> be<00:02:48.550> down<00:02:48.760> elevator<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.510> we're

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
it's going to be down elevator and we're

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.000 
it's going to be down elevator and we're
going<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.110> cross<00:02:50.319> control

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
going to cross control

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.640 
going to cross control
