all<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.140> only<00:02:04.290> quoted<00:02:04.799> half<00:02:05.689> immediately

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
all so we only quoted half immediately

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
all so we only quoted half immediately
quoted<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> whole<00:02:07.320> verse<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.979> only<00:02:08.129> half<00:02:08.489> of

quoted the whole verse but only half of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790 
quoted the whole verse but only half of
Paul's<00:02:08.970> thought<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> period<00:02:10.679> is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
Paul's thought there that the period is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 
Paul's thought there that the period is
at<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> end<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.520> verse<00:02:11.640> six<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> end

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
at the end of verse six not at the end

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.770 
at the end of verse six not at the end
of<00:02:13.530> her

when he was talkin there if Paul's

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.420 
when he was talkin there if Paul's
thought<00:03:47.350> was<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:48.190> what<00:03:48.640> he<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.910> saying<00:03:49.150> in

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
thought was that what he was saying in

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.670 
thought was that what he was saying in
verse<00:03:51.430> five<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:52.120> Lord<00:03:52.510> one<00:03:52.630> faith<00:03:52.870> what<00:03:53.590> he

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
verse five one Lord one faith what he

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.170 
verse five one Lord one faith what he
was<00:03:54.040> saying<00:03:54.340> was<00:03:54.700> Lord<00:03:55.660> meaning<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.470> Lord<00:03:56.650> God

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
was saying was Lord meaning the Lord God

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.699 
was saying was Lord meaning the Lord God
then<00:03:58.180> verse<00:03:58.480> six<00:03:58.780> would<00:03:58.959> never<00:03:59.170> need<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.620> be

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.560 
Lord Christ the Lord Messiah absolutely
and<00:06:48.990> there's<00:06:49.170> none<00:06:49.500> other<00:06:49.740> absolutely<00:06:50.700> in<00:06:51.060> in

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
and there's none other absolutely in in

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.290 
and there's none other absolutely in in
that<00:06:51.870> category<00:06:52.290> of<00:06:52.680> Lord<00:06:52.920> but<00:06:53.220> him<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:53.670> and

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
that category of Lord but him and and

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.090 
that category of Lord but him and and
that's<00:06:54.690> not<00:06:54.930> that<00:06:55.140> hard<00:06:56.450> I<00:06:57.560> like<00:06:58.560> it<00:06:58.800> it<00:06:59.070> just

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
that's not that hard I like it it just

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.220 
that's not that hard I like it it just
makes<00:06:59.580> so<00:06:59.790> much<00:06:59.970> more<00:07:00.180> sense<00:07:00.240> than<00:07:00.720> when<00:07:00.900> I<00:07:00.930> was

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
makes so much more sense than when I was

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.610 
makes so much more sense than when I was
trying<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.920> yes<00:07:02.910> think<00:07:03.690> in<00:07:03.810> terms<00:07:04.020> of<00:07:04.170> one<00:07:04.350> Lord

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
trying to yes think in terms of one Lord

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.560 
trying to yes think in terms of one Lord
and<00:07:04.890> thinking<00:07:05.370> that<00:07:05.490> meant<00:07:05.790> that<00:07:05.850> Jesus<00:07:06.360> was

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
and thinking that meant that Jesus was

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.900 
and thinking that meant that Jesus was
the<00:07:06.690> Lord<00:07:06.900> God<00:07:07.200> yes<00:07:07.860> which<00:07:08.070> then<00:07:08.280> disagreed

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
the Lord God yes which then disagreed

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.110 
the Lord God yes which then disagreed
with<00:07:09.240> scriptures<00:07:09.870> all<00:07:10.170> over<00:07:10.620> my<00:07:11.010> Bible<00:07:11.610> you
