to<00:01:34.950> start<00:01:35.189> off<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.400> least<00:01:35.549> having<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.060> thousand

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to start off at least having a thousand

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
to start off at least having a thousand
dollars<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.049> emergency<00:01:37.200> fund<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
dollars in your emergency fund that's a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
dollars in your emergency fund that's a
good<00:01:38.610> starting<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> home<00:01:40.140> owner

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
good starting point but as a home owner

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.380 
good starting point but as a home owner
I'm<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.860> sure<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> reside<00:01:41.759> but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I'm not really sure where you reside but

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.670 
I'm not really sure where you reside but
you're<00:01:42.540> probably<00:01:42.630> need<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.200> whole<00:01:43.500> lot

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you're probably need to have a whole lot

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
you're probably need to have a whole lot
more<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.759> happens<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> water

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
more because what happens if the water

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.780 
more because what happens if the water
heater<00:01:45.659> goes<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.619> need<00:01:46.799> new<00:01:47.159> landscaping

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
heater goes out you need new landscaping

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.389 
heater goes out you need new landscaping
if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> new<00:01:48.750> garage<00:01:48.960> door<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:50.070> these

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
if you need a new garage door all these

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
if you need a new garage door all these
expenses<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.850> gonna<00:01:50.939> come<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.630> say<00:01:51.899> all

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
expenses are gonna come up and I say all

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
expenses are gonna come up and I say all
this<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> stuff<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.070> has

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this because this is stuff that has

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
this because this is stuff that has
happened<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> us<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.479> we've<00:01:54.689> bought<00:01:54.899> our<00:01:55.020> first

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
happened to us as we've bought our first

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
happened to us as we've bought our first
home<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.159> all<00:01:56.250> things<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.610> didn't

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
home these are all things that we didn't

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
home these are all things that we didn't
plan<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.840> I'll<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.110> first<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.560> admit<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
plan on now I'll be first to admit that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
plan on now I'll be first to admit that
we<00:01:59.040> probably<00:01:59.250> didn't<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.790> enough<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.270> our

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
we probably didn't have enough in our

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.609 
we probably didn't have enough in our
savings<00:02:00.689> when<00:02:00.930> he<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.229> bought<00:02:01.439> our<00:02:01.590> first

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
savings when he we bought our first

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
savings when he we bought our first
house<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.640> at<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> time<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.299> employed<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
house but at the time I was employed to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
house but at the time I was employed to
Iraq<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> had<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> pretty<00:02:04.950> nice<00:02:05.159> guaranteed

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
Iraq so I had a pretty nice guaranteed

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.520 
Iraq so I had a pretty nice guaranteed
income<00:02:05.939> coming<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.290> while<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> was

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
income coming in but while I was

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.199 
income coming in but while I was
deployed<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.489> wife<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.879> talk<00:02:09.179> about

deployed me and my wife would talk about

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.540 
deployed me and my wife would talk about
how<00:02:09.690> much<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:10.050> felt<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.800> need<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.430> our

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
how much we felt we need to have in our

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
how much we felt we need to have in our
savings<00:02:11.970> account<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.720> made<00:02:12.900> us<00:02:13.020> feel

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
savings account that made us feel

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.030 
savings account that made us feel
comfort

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
comfort

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.530 
comfort
and<00:02:14.160> then<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.910> started<00:02:15.210> off<00:02:15.360> at<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and then I'm out it started off at a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.730 
and then I'm out it started off at a
thousand<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.110> think<00:02:16.140> you've<00:02:16.350> heard<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.560> three

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
thousand I think you've heard of three

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.440 
thousand I think you've heard of three
thousand<00:02:17.160> eventually<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.610> five<00:02:17.850> thousand

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
thousand eventually this five thousand

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
thousand eventually this five thousand
and<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.870> kept<00:02:19.050> growing<00:02:19.230> from<00:02:19.650> there<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.490> you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and it kept growing from there but you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.830 
and it kept growing from there but you
just<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> starting<00:02:21.600> point

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
just have to have the starting point

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.960 
just have to have the starting point
where<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.110> feel<00:02:22.350> most<00:02:22.560> comfortable<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.550> as

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
where you feel most comfortable and as

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.000 
where you feel most comfortable and as
we<00:02:24.150> reach<00:02:24.390> these<00:02:24.600> new<00:02:24.870> minimums<00:02:25.710> in<00:02:25.890> our

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
we reach these new minimums in our

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.310 
we reach these new minimums in our
savings<00:02:26.250> account<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:27.090> try<00:02:27.420> our<00:02:27.720> best<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.080> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
savings account we try our best not to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.200 
savings account we try our best not to
dip<00:02:28.500> below<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.850> start<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
dip below that and if we do we start to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.690 
dip below that and if we do we start to
freak<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:30.810> which<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.560> should<00:02:31.890> because

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
freak out which you should because

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.190 
freak out which you should because
that's<00:02:32.820> your<00:02:33.060> safety<00:02:33.480> net<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.780> don't<00:02:33.930> ever

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that's your safety net you don't ever

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.810 
that's your safety net you don't ever
wanna<00:02:34.470> dip<00:02:34.650> below<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.430> once<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.700> get

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
wanna dip below that so once you get

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.400 
wanna dip below that so once you get
your<00:02:35.970> savings<00:02:36.360> account<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.780> order<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.320> this
