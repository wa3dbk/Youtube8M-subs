00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.849
 many think that the breeder of rabbits 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.039
 can become every mole bought a pair 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.010
 animals planted together and wait 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.150
 in fact, everything is much more complicated 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.670
 rabbit breeding for sergey yutkina 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.890
 started a pair of eared gifted by a friend 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.470
 routine care for them day after day 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.690
 moved into the passion of life now later 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.579
 three years nursery sergey nikolaevich a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.670
 has about 50 representatives 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.400
 Flandre breeds of Patagonian descendants 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.100
 rabbits imported from argentina eared 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.559
 massive flander clumsily however has 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.530
 unique features peculiar only to them 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.180
 its characteristic 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.189
 feature large massive ears 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:11.030
 Muzzle big paws especially for affairs 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:15.710
 look what here I am and they 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.110
 Knox cut it all and here the name 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.509
 be sure to cut the nails and otherwise 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.700
 they have this developing disease 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:28.549
 different rabbits of this breed quickly 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.549
 weight gain is one fluffy 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.560
 ranges from 6 to 10 kilograms of course 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.929
 in order for animals to be in such 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.179
 the form requires not only their content 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.429
 in spacious cages but also qualitative 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.310
 feed containing special additives 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.560
 cereals and vegetables and hay harvested 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.630
 it is necessary to feed the rabbits in the fall 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.880
 less than twice a day and this is quite 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.159
 costly from the financial side but Sergey 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.409
 Nikolaevich for their pets does not regret 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.270
 any funds not needed each time the entire 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:08.600
 feed surround with your care 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:09.690
 about well going for a year the grain will go well and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.230
 strong 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.880
 ton nine system leads not much 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.069
 despite the fact that flandr adapted 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.110
 for keeping outdoors even 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.849
 in difficult climatic conditions and 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.709
 has a very resistant immune 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.989
 systems and to various diseases 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.700
 they require careful personal care 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.050
 which includes timely 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.250
 vaccination yes must be done 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.510
 we do vaccinations against geological 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.790
 fever against myxomatosis do vaccinations 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.709
 and so on 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.620
 the country has to watch over them and 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.640
 also use a little 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.580
 some veterinary conditions or how 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.220
 say disease brazilian disease 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.980
 there are many different 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.600
 I like to follow this one 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:16.570
 big huge rock out great but 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.590
 as if they are late ripening they ripen 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:24.670
 for posterity they need it means thats 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.959
 allow after eight months earlier 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.090
 ordinary rabbits 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.910
 they are capable after four months 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.040
 produce offspring and these are not and not 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.760
 later ripe somewhere just after 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.079
 eight months they can argue 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.120
 flandr and different from other breeds 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.609
 rabbits with their high intelligence and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.799
 extraordinarily calm temper possible 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.840
 so to Sergei Nikolaevich often 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.060
 are asking them to sell but 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.250
 the rabbit here is determined and so far 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.200
 does not sell its own money 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.840
 pets paraphrasing a famous phrase 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.150
 because rabbits are not only valuable fur but 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.010
 and guaranteed moral return any 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.019
 stress passes only at one glance 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
 on these furry creatures 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.540
 Olga Zharikova ballist brykov specially 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.540
 for stb
