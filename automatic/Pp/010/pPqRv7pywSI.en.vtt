00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 sounds good this time I 'm going to 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.940
 teach how to know if your iphone has 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.009
 some virus and how to eliminate it 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.920
 one of the most frequent viruses in these 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.840
 devices is the one called and that penetrates 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.240
 from the internet and infect the terminal 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.160
 immediately that the files 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.310
 necessary to block and prevent the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.590
 access by ssh to the owner 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.689
 will only allow the connection to the attacker 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.300
 from external site to part of the symptom is 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.410
 impossible to access the interior of the iphone 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.360
 with the programs that we used 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.430
 there will usually be no reason 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.640
 to suspect that the device is 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.379
 infested if ssh is reinstalled 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.660
 connection will only be possible during 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.760
 some minutes quickly the virus 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.290
 will block the connection 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.989
 if you have the application my 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.760
 Fire can explore the interior of the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.780
 iPhone since it does not need ssh 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.650
 identify the files created by the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.869
 virus 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.809
 you can delete them manually what 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.330
 will solve the problem if you do not have ai 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.080
 file you have to download 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.860
 directly from cydia we will not enter 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.130
 Syria and in Cydia 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.920
 we would add a repo 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.450
 that if they follow my videos good and to the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.960
 must have is the power crap touch 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.350
 is the repose erepublik dotcom that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.369
 it would be this one here 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.400
 Ripoll Puntocom only needs you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.950
 add 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.640
 and added and we will repo 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.009
 beep dotcom and add way font 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.150
 help I do it because I already have it good 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.980
 once we have added it 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.820
 let's 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.800
 to look for it as we are going to look for it we are going to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.870
 wait to finish loading this 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.370
 what is a file that was installing 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.320
 of 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.320
 well something was installing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.819
 and let's go to the search section 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.860
 let's go here to look and just 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.380
 we put there file forgiveness 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.900
 my fire let's choose this one that 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.540
 has the calaverita if we choose the one 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.090
 it has is that it is blue is going to be 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.560
 We can not use payment or we will 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.030
 use only we pay so 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.070
 we download this to be totally 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.340
 free we install it and we're going to 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.670
 make a jump after that we're going to 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.590
 enter now yes by ai file 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.680
 until our bites to our 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.680
 application 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.660
 here and we're going to enter the route 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:57.230
 to the vii route to know if we are 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.740
 infected we must know if in the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.790
 route vii 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:08.799
 s ssh peace we will have that file 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.379
 is that our ours is infected 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.280
 iphone or our iphone in our case 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:19.350
 Ok here 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:24.400
 see it here is the peace ssh to have that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:29.019
 file I already know that it is infected 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:33.689
 well I return there is another route that is the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:39.390
 same bean route and it's but you drink or tea 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.390
 but it is drunk or we are going to look for you 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.989
 It seems that this is not 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:53.299
 It's not good, we get rid of it 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.299
 one the other will be the system 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.830
 free 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.830
 outs of mons 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.220
 and here we are going to look for the one that says with 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.250
 point 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.050
 bb &amp; t 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.380
 with point and key 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.540
 baby tea point 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.239
 do not worry about the names are the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.640
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.210
 so that you yourselves look for them and 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.060
 once the buildings identify the 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.310
 eliminate the truth now and so bad 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.940
 I did not know I did not look for it because of how 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:38.180
 I'm late I do not know if I have them and 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.220
 if here is this 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.729
 it's archiving everything is the only thing 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.729
 They have to do 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.770
 is to eliminate it 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.849
 with that with that simple 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.470
 it's simple touch that application with that 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.020
 we will have already gotten rid of that virus 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.620
 Like all find then there 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.860
 another one that is this 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.860
 It is root bar 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.670
 loc 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:20.199
 I see what point there is another 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.199
 we eliminate it 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.420
 and the other one is bar 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.550
 loc 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.550
 you can not be close 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.690
 good a point jpg is coming as image 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.070
 here we see it I do not have it and the other 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.070
 mobile landing 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.400
 slow background is also another image and 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.230
 I do not have it good, the only thing that 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.480
 we have to do is those files 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:56.870
 eliminate them and not have this 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.530
 the active ssh when I do not when I do not 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.160
 we are using when you are simple 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 with this simple 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.970
 action we will have already cleaned our 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.800
 phone but we should be careful 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.460
 of that type of virus that I turn to 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.720
 repeat is called and that and good in the 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.240
 description of the video I will leave you 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.330
 the routes to be searched by the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.060
 iphone and delete those files 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.860
 good friends this has been everything I hope
