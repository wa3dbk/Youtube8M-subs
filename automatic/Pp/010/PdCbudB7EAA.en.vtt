00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.920
 so luciana, gentlemen, with you, I 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 I'm rodrigo and welcome to 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.660
 third chapter of master's diaries 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.550
 call where I'll show you some 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.609
 excerpts from my championship debut 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 Brazilian government that is called the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.010
 Brazil in the foot 2013 only recapitulating that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 I already did until now I played the pre 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 season in which a disaster tied the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.450
 I then lost the rest of the game, too. 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 I'll be in the cup of Brazil where the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.559
 draw for 1 to 1 and then I finished 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 winning on penalties you saw that the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 episode two of the diaries but also 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.899
 had my second match in the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 Brazil that I ended up not being able to show 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.350
 It was a great departure for you. 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.239
 which I won by 2 to 1 in the overtime 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.850
 This was cool because it's kind of 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.059
 progression i have cbt chance o 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.190
 graph and performance because 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.370
 match against Fluminense that you already 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 You see I played even better myself. 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.220
 I thought I played much better already 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.740
 I was able to make plays that I did not 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.659
 I could do at the beginning already 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.950
 I started scoring in a bid 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.170
 unexpected 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 I got mixed up already kicking the ball in the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 angle and opened 1 to 0 which is very good 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 because I thought the match was going to be 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.990
 very difficult from the month and makes 1 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 0 you get even more quiet for 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 try plays that you know how to do 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.350
 better and everything else 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.960
 one thing you learn from 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.750
 even while playing the master league at 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.630
 playing your own foot is to calibrate a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 little better because the force of the kick in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 At least I started who had great 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.630
 custom to play the versions for ps2 have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 the tendency not to tighten up the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.820
 kick power bar 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 and this ends up making you 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 made a few good bids 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.320
 frustrating you make a good move arrives 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.719
 in the face of the goal and ends up pushing back the ball 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 from the goalie who kicked very weak but 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.380
 When are you going to play some more? 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 You will notice that in some bids 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.579
 and some positions you have to tighten 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.879
 the much more button for the kick came out of the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.289
 The way you would like it, well afterwards. 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.180
 from my first goal 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.410
 the game turned that cookie 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 traditional 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.350
 I played some mixed league master. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.870
 good bids too but above all the cei 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.540
 very dangerous in some others while 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.590
 win for 1 to 0 Rio de Janeiro has arrived 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.590
 a good times near my area and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.870
 also managed to lose goals despite 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 they have less possession of them 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.280
 lost some goals that were 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 converted I think that from being 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.950
 much more complicated than she 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.790
 really was the first time over 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.250
 with the possession of ball much bigger mine 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.020
 but I still do not think this 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.700
 reflected an alleged superiority 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.940
 on the field because I can not do 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.440
 without so many brilliant plays but 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.280
 The second time I think I played well. 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.030
 best 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.400
 I started playing the ball better and I think 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.170
 that the hiring that I did of the stretches 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.750
 you who watched accused two 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.880
 Remember, I think it's been a lot 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.550
 efficient way was a good hiring because 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.640
 He is a guy who plays the ball well. 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.830
 turns fast and it shows up well I think 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.660
 a lot of people playing the master league 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.610
 then they throw feet at more levels 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.050
 with at least teams that do not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.940
 are so top 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.400
 I felt a little difficulty in this 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.200
 sense so the players sometimes they 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.600
 they do not show up the way you do. 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.720
 I would like it but it's something that you will 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.420
 improving the game's own experience 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.640
 even with changes in the tactical formation of 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.580
 team and things like that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.959
 I managed to make good bids thrown 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.910
 very good 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.560
 one of them even resulted in goal was 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.300
 a cross on the left side a good 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.510
 including that I succeeded 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.310
 convert very well and from there it 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.630
 already is much quieter for the whole 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.820
 rest of the game 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.840
 I was in danger on some bids but 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.060
 I think it was not too much and it's not 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.310
 so the match that ended was triggered 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.580
 being more relaxed throughout the 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.120
 trajectory in the master league so far is 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.799
 that's right 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.410
 this was just a quick report 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.790
 to update you on the progress 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.680
 in the master league 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.479
 I hope you are enjoying the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.700
 series and if you have any suggestions 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.270
 To do that, let's do what I can there. 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.430
 to implement 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.990
 next episodes this episode here in 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.389
 truth was to have been made live 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.520
 which turned out to be an audio problem 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.750
 and I had to make an account as well as 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.580
 already done in the first two 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.960
 episodes but you can expect 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.610
 live matches in next 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.620
 opportunities that I'm sure will do 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.330
 yes the khan face and everything else 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.090
 that's all I liked the video clip 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.220
 I liked it and if you're seeing the first one
