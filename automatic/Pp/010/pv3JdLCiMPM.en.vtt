00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello everyone welcome on the channel 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.980
 youtube dog team we will you 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.019
 present the grant model today 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 2005 undoubtedly helped so necklace of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.280
 training and tracking so long 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 range door and 1500 meters provided for 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.850
 two dogs as for all the collar 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 of award training it is provided with 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.460
 a shockproof hard case very well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.400
 protected very well padded deliver there 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.500
 with all of its accessories 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.230
 you will find in the dr at 2502 t and b 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.480
 a user manual completes a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.430
 charger with a double-plug system 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.899
 to simultaneously load 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 two necklaces as well as the remote 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.309
 in the load so ultra short so 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.100
 two to three hours with the new 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.500
 accumulators lithium scoop you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.360
 will also find a pair of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 test lamps to check so 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.789
 the proper functioning of the necklaces and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.379
 the two necklaces per se 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.449
 as well as the remote control necklace 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.140
 provides here so with straps of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.940
 bright colors 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.920
 here so neon green and neon orange 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.070
 thus allowing a very visual identification 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.700
 very easy of both dogs and so the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.189
 remote control 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.470
 it is provided with a strap as well 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.939
 a belt clip 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 the remote control lights up it so 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.610
 very simple with an on / off button here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.610
 on the side 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.479
 the collar him alone a very way 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 simple with here a little red dot on 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.360
 which one comes to place the other point 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.290
 red on the back of the remote control 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 so you have a sound signal 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.000
 crescendo that indicates that the necklace and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.310
 well lit and that allows to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 visualize here with means of aaland test 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.880
 the proper functioning of the necklace 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.400
 dressage so the training collar 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.130
 works with two types of simulation 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.470
 short stimulation which is a small 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.700
 electric flicking like these one 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.549
 can see it directly on the moor 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 test a short stimulation and a 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.890
 long simulation which she is a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 simulation a little more consistent 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.560
 and who therefore sends a stimulation 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.759
 electric a little more consistent 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.180
 that the short simulation 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.360
 short stimulation and therefore only 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.890
 a little electric flick 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.360
 stimulation long short stimulation 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.850
 so that's about the dressage part 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.230
 with electrical stimulation 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.380
 concerning the tracking part so the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.450
 2500 tb collar and so you have 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.810
 so a sound flag here on the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.459
 above the collar and so by means of this 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.959
 sound flag so this one can 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.530
 emit a myth depending on the mode 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.720
 so chose on the collar dr at 2502 tb 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.150
 you go three modes of beeping that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.370
 you will be offered so the first 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 mode the bipper and emit a camp sound 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.030
 that the dog is moving as well as 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.739
 when the dog is holding the stop so all 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.600
 the seven seconds when the dog will be in 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.280
 move the bipper will emit a sound this 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.400
 which will allow you to spot 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.780
 very easy the dog's journey and so 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.209
 every seven seconds you will have a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.850
 beep that would be emitted when the dog gets 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.530
 will freeze and begin to hold the rai the 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.209
 the masters necklace one are all 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.670
 the two seconds which will allow you 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.650
 so to find very easily the dog 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.700
 if the dog is no longer standing and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.250
 put back in motion 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.810
 there in these cases the necklace is going to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.640
 restart and therefore will beep 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.640
 regularly every 7 seconds 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.100
 so here it is the first mode the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.900
 second mode the collar him will not issue 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.549
 a sound only when the dog fires the stop 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.380
 that is, for the second mode 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.680
 when the dog will be moving on 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.239
 bipper will be totally silent and by 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.010
 against as soon as the dog will be held to 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.660
 stop more than five seconds there in 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.580
 these cases the bipper will put him in 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.280
 action and so will emit a beep of 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.570
 tracking to prevent and so there this 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.650
 will only be when the dog dog 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.930
 stop as soon as the dog is in 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.780
 move the bipper will be perfectly 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.459
 silent so that was the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.769
 second mode 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.390
 concerning the third mode the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.420
 third mode is actually a 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.829
 totally silent necklace the bipper 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.269
 will be silent when the dog is in 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.250
 movement and the bipper would also be 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.049
 silent when the dog will hold 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.549
 the stop is there on this third 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.090
 man we have a necklace perfectly 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.640
 silent whether it's mode 1 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.560
 mode 2 or mode 3 at any time 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.890
 you can anyway locate the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.170
 dog by sound signal 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.840
 complementary so the same if the 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.579
 necklace is perfectly silent you 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.660
 can at any time use the key 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.610
 to locate the dog 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.410
 and so there what allows you to spot 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.010
 in a very easy way the dog even if 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.030
 the collar and totally silent 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.560
 that is to say that in the end we can not 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.970
 use the sound tracking mode 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.380
 only once or twice a day if we 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.810
 is in silent mode and we use 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.250
 this localization key this 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.780
 touch we can quite use it 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.060
 also in addition when the bipper 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.490
 rings when stopped or when the bipper and 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.630
 use another mode so this is a 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.610
 something that is really handy 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.640
 that is, regardless of the mode 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.470
 we can spot the dog I forgot the 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.150
 three preprogrammed modes 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.530
 you can change them at any time 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.910
 during the hunt that is to say that you 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.010
 do not have to pre-programmed 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.020
 before the hunt you can at any 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.510
 moment in the course of hunting action 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.080
 change the mode directly here with the 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.000
 remote control 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.490
 so that's a very, very, very 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.040
 easy to handle so the collar of 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.960
 tracking we have done here all our 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.580
 tests with the green strap 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.960
 but this necklace is well supplied 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.550
 for two dogs and so you have 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.840
 also a necklace with a strap 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:24.700
 orange sobs range here that we 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.610
 let's go to him but we have the signal 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.470
 here crescendo which bleeding so the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.940
 orange strap in fact we have here a 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.560
 visual distinction between the two 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.390
 necklaces between a neon green strap and 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.370
 a neon orange strap but it's not 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.740
 everything we also have a system of 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.390
 sound tracking that is to say that the 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.880
 green collar will emit a little sound 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.410
 little more acute than the orange collar that 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.540
 will sound a little more 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.340
 serious meaning that even if the 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.460
 dogs are out of sight 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.200
 good it will always be very easy to 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.730
 determine what is the dog with the 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.930
 orange strap what is the dog with the 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.600
 green strap 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.800
 we'll just test it here 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:06.180
 verb strap emit a high-pitched sound and here 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.550
 the orange strap will emit a serious sound 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:14.200
 seems green seems to angels 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.390
 and so thanks to this means it helps to 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.000
 to identify very accurately 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.830
 the dog one and the dog place the dog 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.780
 who owns the orange strap and the dog 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.669
 who owns the green strap and not the 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.610
 even when they are out of range 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.460
 visual it's still very easy to 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.050
 spot the dog or dog 2 comment 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.129
 is the adjustment between the dog and the 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.110
 dog 2 it's very simple you have a 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.870
 little his readers on the top with 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.849
 here the orange or other indications and 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.409
 so in fact when the selector and on 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.110
 the top he is on the green strap when 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:46.360
 the selector and on the orange indication 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.150
 he's on the orange strap looks green 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.960
 seems orange green strap and seems 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.610
 orange and then then to turn off the 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.240
 necklaces it's very simple just 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:03.520
 mac had the red buttons one against 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.129
 the other in order to extinguish the necklaces and 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.509
 the remote control it is indirectly 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:11.800
 on the button on off of this one 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.539
 concerning the tightness of the collars 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.789
 these are perfectly waterproof that this 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.289
 either freshwater seawater mud or 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.330
 all other climatic conditions 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.770
 necklaces are perfectly waterproof 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.560
 even the sound flag is really there 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.810
 no worries you go here on the side 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.490
 a small hood to allow the 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.479
 loading the necklace even if this one 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.759
 is open there is no problem 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:32.199
 about the chic clans and it's just 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.490
 to prevent that dog's hair from 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.289
 the mud or others that come so 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.690
 interposed but the collar will remain 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:41.740
 perfectly waterproof the remote control
