 good afternoon bathhouse lovers not only 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.779
 today i want to tell you about 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.350
 medical treatment procedure 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.300
 warmed up 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.550
 which can be easily done with 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 help here about this red cabin 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.929
 Finnish company hop than infrared 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 the cabin is different from the usual self 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.550
 In ordinary words do not bake great air 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.939
 then the hot air effects on 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 human skin makes him sweat 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.300
 infrared heat time air body 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519
 man and penetrates to some 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.130
 depth therefore the human body is not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.969
 heats up and warms up and these are two 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.420
 big differences 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.730
 so the closer the radiation spectrum 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 heaters to human radiation 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.280
 these heaters are better in their 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 efficiency today the best 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 many parameters are carboxylic 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.930
 radiator which are installed in this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 cockpit 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.789
 as they fill their shield 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.160
 the rays of life all space and in each 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 power point is the same in this case 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.699
 all parts of the body will be evenly 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 heat up won't crash the system 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.150
 body thermoregulation for comfort in 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.650
 the cabin is equipped with underfloor heating and heating 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.689
 shops in the cabin is installed as well

 chromotherapy with fixation or smooth 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 color changes in order to completely 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 relax and not be bored during 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.720
 procedures in the cabin installed radio 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.150
 with remote control and 2 heat resistant 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.130
 the speaker is also inside the cabin is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.130
 control panel infrared sauna 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.520
 two-way control panel 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.020
 infrared sauna is simple and understandable for 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.409
 to turn on the infrared sauna 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.530
 also press the button it of the path will turn on 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.540
 the top of the time display 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.640
 buttons up down we set 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.490
 soaring time maximum time 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 procedures 60 minutes below is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.420
 temperature indicator 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.759
 in the same way we can set 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.909
 maximum evaporation temperature 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.220
 log temperature is 65 degrees from the left 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.610
 the sides are the control buttons 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.569
 chromotherapy and interior lighting 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.329
 saunas 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.060
 Right is fond of the power button 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:22.560
 floor heating and benches and a button 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.420
 switching on outdoor lighting completion 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.370
 I want to remind that infrared sauna 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.739
 it's unusual left here enough 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.540
 only 40 degrees and then the selection at 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.639
 this will be two times more than in the bath 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590
 because of their sitting temperatures 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.840
 body's infrared sauna is transferred 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.659
 much easier therefore recommended for 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.669
 old people and children some more tips 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.370
 drink well before taking procedures 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.159
 about a liter of water it compensates for the loss 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.419
 body with excessive sweating 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.909
 also before and after the procedure is desirable 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:54.500
 to take a shower 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.500
