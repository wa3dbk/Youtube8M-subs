00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.949 
Saddam and right where Saddam is I want
you<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.860> put<00:03:02.069> there's<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.610> salt<00:03:03.000> dome<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
you to put there's a salt dome that's a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.600 
you to put there's a salt dome that's a
mountain<00:03:04.170> sticking<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.010> there<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.519> it's

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
mountain sticking up there and it's

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.300 
mountain sticking up there and it's
going<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.390> mountain<00:03:09.870> itself

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
going that way in the mountain itself

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.280 
going that way in the mountain itself
there<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:12.140> 2.8<00:03:13.140> kilometers<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:15.409> solid<00:03:16.409> salt

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
there is 2.8 kilometers of solid salt

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.770 
there is 2.8 kilometers of solid salt
surrounded<00:03:19.290> by<00:03:19.379> some<00:03:19.590> dirt<00:03:20.510> but<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.629> can

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
surrounded by some dirt but you can

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.050 
surrounded by some dirt but you can
basically<00:03:21.900> go<00:03:22.379> up<00:03:22.500> brush<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.099> off<00:03:23.250> grab<00:03:23.700> salt

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
basically go up brush it off grab salt

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.539 
basically go up brush it off grab salt
walk<00:03:24.420> away<00:03:24.739> people<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:25.859> been<00:03:25.950> doing<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.340> for

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
walk away people have been doing it for

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.599 
walk away people have been doing it for
centuries<00:03:27.319> now<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.379> salt<00:03:28.769> dike<00:03:29.129> that<00:03:29.489> is

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
centuries now the salt dike that is

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.000 
centuries now the salt dike that is
there<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.480> once<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:30.750> imagine<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.379> sometime

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
there and once you imagine that sometime

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.229 
there and once you imagine that sometime
during<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.090> middle<00:03:33.780> Bronze<00:03:34.079> period<00:03:34.769> an

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
during the middle Bronze period an

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.390 
during the middle Bronze period an
earthquake<00:03:36.239> occurred<00:03:36.690> here<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.739> earthquakes

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
earthquake occurred here now earthquakes

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.180 
earthquake occurred here now earthquakes
occur<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:38.909> all<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.540> time<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.680> some<00:03:40.950> time

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
occur here all the time but some time

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.910 
occur here all the time but some time
then<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.670> was<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> bad<00:03:42.060> enough<00:03:42.239> quake<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.170> what

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
then it was a bad enough quake and what

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.039 
then it was a bad enough quake and what
happened<00:03:44.370> was<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:45.090> other<00:03:45.299> side<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
happened was the other side the

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.530 
happened was the other side the
Jordanian<00:03:46.680> side<00:03:46.950> pulled<00:03:47.879> away<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.930> south

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
Jordanian side pulled away and south

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.910 
Jordanian side pulled away and south
normally<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.629> pulls<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.230> north<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:52.799> on

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
normally it pulls to the north but on

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.349 
normally it pulls to the north but on
this<00:03:53.099> one<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.400> pulled<00:03:53.579> away<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.090> south

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
this one it pulled away and south

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.229 
this one it pulled away and south
causing<00:03:54.930> an<00:03:55.019> open<00:03:55.349> tear<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.980> where<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.000> Dead

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
causing an open tear and where the Dead

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.339 
causing an open tear and where the Dead
Sea<00:03:57.269> was<00:03:59.060> probably<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.269> southern<00:04:00.780> half<00:04:01.199> of

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
Sea was probably the southern half of

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.640 
Sea was probably the southern half of
the<00:04:01.410> Dead<00:04:01.709> Sea<00:04:01.980> dropped<00:04:02.790> very<00:04:03.780> quickly<00:04:06.650> what

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the Dead Sea dropped very quickly what

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.009 
the Dead Sea dropped very quickly what
we<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.280> tear<00:04:08.849> also<00:04:09.299> caused<00:04:09.629> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
we know is that tear also caused the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.559 
we know is that tear also caused the
pressure<00:04:10.319> inside<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:11.310> shoot<00:04:11.639> a<00:04:11.819> salt<00:04:12.150> dike<00:04:12.540> a

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
pressure inside to shoot a salt dike a

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.580 
pressure inside to shoot a salt dike a
show<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.069> spike<00:04:14.069> of<00:04:14.510> molten<00:04:15.510> salt<00:04:15.900> came<00:04:16.229> up<00:04:16.440> out

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
show a spike of molten salt came up out

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.430 
show a spike of molten salt came up out
of<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.979> ground<00:04:17.479> how<00:04:18.479> do<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:18.690> know<00:04:18.840> when<00:04:19.289> it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
of the ground how do I know when it

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.110 
of the ground how do I know when it
happened<00:04:19.889> guys<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.340> shouldn't<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.760> believe

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
happened guys you shouldn't just believe

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.510 
happened guys you shouldn't just believe
me<00:04:21.389> one<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.470> things<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:23.250> should<00:04:23.430> be

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
me one of the things that you should be

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.529 
me one of the things that you should be
doing<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.910> saying<00:04:24.120> how<00:04:24.270> could<00:04:24.419> he<00:04:24.510> possibly

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
doing is saying how could he possibly

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:40.580 
doing is saying how could he possibly
know<00:04:25.169> when<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.710> happened

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.650 

you
