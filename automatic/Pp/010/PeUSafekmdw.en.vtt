however<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.470> couldn't<00:01:25.470> follow<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.280> lot<00:01:26.670> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
however I couldn't follow it a lot of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.539 
however I couldn't follow it a lot of
the<00:01:26.970> terms<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.659> use<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.979> over<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.340> head

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the terms they use go right over my head

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.700 
the terms they use go right over my head
if<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> hadn't<00:01:30.630> been<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.750> pro<00:01:30.900> technobabble<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
if it hadn't been a pro technobabble I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
if it hadn't been a pro technobabble I
would<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:31.979> finished<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.310> book<00:01:32.369> much

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
would have finished this book much

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.149 
would have finished this book much
faster<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> while<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.320> does<00:01:34.500> slow<00:01:34.740> down<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
faster and while it does slow down the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
faster and while it does slow down the
book<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> ruins<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:37.140> as

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
book I don't think it ruins it now as

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.580 
book I don't think it ruins it now as
for<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> story<00:01:39.150> itself<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.900> thought<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
for just the story itself I thought this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
for just the story itself I thought this
book<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:40.829> amazing<00:01:41.610> my<00:01:41.820> favorite<00:01:42.180> thing<00:01:42.210> about

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
to locations of exploring and then it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.380 
to locations of exploring and then it
gradually<00:02:17.069> became<00:02:18.069> darker<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
gradually became darker and that's not a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.759 
gradually became darker and that's not a
bad<00:02:19.599> thing<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:20.049> really<00:02:21.510> went<00:02:22.510> well<00:02:22.659> with<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
bad thing it really went well with the

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.449 
bad thing it really went well with the
story<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> plot<00:02:26.080> sort<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.650> gets<00:02:27.069> darker

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
story the plot sort of gets darker

towards<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.879> end<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.299> thought<00:02:29.110> Larry<00:02:29.290> Niven

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
towards the end I thought Larry Niven

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.530 
towards the end I thought Larry Niven
did<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.010> perfectly<00:02:30.549> he<00:02:31.090> made<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.269> really

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
did this perfectly he made a really

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.509 
did this perfectly he made a really
great<00:02:31.780> change<00:02:32.170> from<00:02:32.650> light-hearted

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
great change from light-hearted

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.970 
great change from light-hearted
adventure<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.890> darker<00:02:37.200> survival<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
adventure to darker survival the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.619 
adventure to darker survival the
opinions<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.489> had<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:40.000> each<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.450> characters

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
opinions I had of each of the characters

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.140 
opinions I had of each of the characters
evolved<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.680> lot<00:02:41.739> over<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.670> course<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:43.030> this
