00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.750 

with<00:00:57.720> 8,000<00:00:58.720> degrees<00:00:58.840> up<00:00:59.320> there<00:00:59.640> which<00:01:00.640> I

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
with 8,000 degrees up there which I

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.190 
with 8,000 degrees up there which I
realize<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.270> is<00:01:01.450> fun<00:01:01.600> as<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.809> surface<00:01:02.020> of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
realize this is fun as the surface of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.829 
realize this is fun as the surface of
the<00:01:02.290> Sun<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.620> that's<00:01:02.860> how<00:01:03.040> hot<00:01:03.220> it<00:01:03.340> was<00:01:03.370> I

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
the Sun and that's how hot it was I

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.000 
the Sun and that's how hot it was I
think<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.199> could<00:01:05.320> have<00:01:05.440> used<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.680> little

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
think that we could have used a little

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.740 
think that we could have used a little
less<00:01:06.100> heat<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.190> little<00:01:09.940> more<00:01:10.090> cool

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
less heat a little a little more cool

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.390 
less heat a little a little more cool
air<00:01:11.020> whatever<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.650> night
