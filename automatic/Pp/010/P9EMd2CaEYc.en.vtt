00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
flat with UV cut which basically means

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.160 
flat with UV cut which basically means
it's<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.520> flat<00:02:21.730> coat<00:02:21.970> with<00:02:22.180> some<00:02:22.690> protecting

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
and I topped it off with some Tamiya

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.570 
and I topped it off with some Tamiya
clear<00:02:25.600> coat<00:02:25.810> giving<00:02:26.560> me<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.950> more<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.490> a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
clear coat giving me this more of a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.220 
clear coat giving me this more of a
natural<00:02:27.760> matte<00:02:28.240> looking<00:02:28.510> finish<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:28.930> opposed

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
natural matte looking finish as opposed

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.720 
natural matte looking finish as opposed
to<00:02:29.290> having<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.680> glossy<00:02:29.890> greasy<00:02:30.250> looking<00:02:30.550> finish

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
to having a glossy greasy looking finish

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.190 
to having a glossy greasy looking finish
and<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.330> think<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.750> looks<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.960> lot<00:02:32.140> better

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and I think it looks a lot better

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.830 
and I think it looks a lot better

in with some gray and yeah that looks
bland<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> boring<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.420> doesn't<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
bland and boring it doesn't have the

areas as you can see though the legs

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.640 
areas as you can see though the legs
still<00:03:33.300> remain<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> same<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> amount<00:03:34.530> of

Bend that that we can show are still
just<00:03:36.300> as<00:03:36.480> impressive

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
just as impressive

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.320 
just as impressive
I<00:03:37.170> did<00:03:37.920> find<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.250> hindrance<00:03:38.520> though<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
I did find a hindrance though in the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.060 
I did find a hindrance though in the
ankle<00:03:39.690> joint<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.110> top<00:03:40.320> part<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.920> only

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
ankle joint the top part that's only

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.830 
ankle joint the top part that's only
because<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.490> have<00:03:41.520> armor<00:03:42.060> pieces<00:03:42.240> on<00:03:42.510> now<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
because you have armor pieces on now the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.330 
because you have armor pieces on now the
upper<00:03:43.020> body<00:03:43.170> still<00:03:43.500> remains<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.830> same<00:03:44.070> and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
upper body still remains the same and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.670 
upper body still remains the same and
the<00:03:45.000> neck<00:03:45.180> still<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.110> disappointing

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
the neck still it's just a disappointing

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.160 
the neck still it's just a disappointing
but<00:03:47.640> probably<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.090> most<00:03:48.150> noticeable<00:03:48.540> change

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
but probably the most noticeable change

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.900

parts the x-ray repair is a selling
point<00:07:06.130> in<00:07:06.280> itself<00:07:06.550> especially<00:07:07.390> if<00:07:07.450> you're

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
point in itself especially if you're

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.880 
point in itself especially if you're
thinking<00:07:07.690> of<00:07:07.930> getting<00:07:08.110> the<00:07:08.350> ignition<00:07:08.740> mode

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
thinking of getting the ignition mode

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.450 
thinking of getting the ignition mode
set<00:07:09.210> so<00:07:10.210> what<00:07:10.330> do<00:07:10.390> I<00:07:10.480> think<00:07:10.510> after<00:07:11.050> all<00:07:11.080> I<00:07:11.460> think

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
set so what do I think after all I think

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.190 
set so what do I think after all I think
that<00:07:12.580> if<00:07:12.700> xcr<00:07:13.120> pair<00:07:13.300> were<00:07:13.450> to<00:07:13.540> be<00:07:13.660> its<00:07:13.810> own<00:07:13.930> kit

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
that if xcr pair were to be its own kit

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.110 
that if xcr pair were to be its own kit
I<00:07:14.410> think<00:07:14.860> it<00:07:14.980> could<00:07:15.100> stand<00:07:15.280> up<00:07:15.460> to<00:07:15.490> its<00:07:15.730> own

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.430 

there's<00:07:19.120> one<00:07:19.360> more<00:07:19.540> thing<00:07:19.810> I<00:07:19.840> gotta<00:07:20.050> bring<00:07:20.290> up

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 
there's one more thing I gotta bring up

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.230 
there's one more thing I gotta bring up
before<00:07:20.530> I<00:07:20.710> close<00:07:20.920> this<00:07:20.950> review<00:07:24.000> but<00:07:25.000> does
