like a really panned a painting handle
you<00:02:31.900> count<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.530> erase<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.930> also

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
you count on to erase and you can also

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.170 
you count on to erase and you can also
do<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.710> Photoshop<00:02:36.220> there's<00:02:36.490> several<00:02:36.850> layers

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
do like Photoshop there's several layers

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.700 
do like Photoshop there's several layers
and<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.950> also<00:02:39.160> do<00:02:39.400> something<00:02:39.790> like

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.090 

okay<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.220> show<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:44.910> argue

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
is it what is a lack time the delay when

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.940 
is it what is a lack time the delay when
you<00:02:51.840> catch<00:02:52.020> actually<00:02:54.530> I'm<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.740> quite<00:02:55.920> sure

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you catch actually I'm not quite sure

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.310 
you catch actually I'm not quite sure
but<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.460> feel<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.880> quite<00:02:57.210> sensitive<00:02:57.660> once<00:02:58.140> you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
but I feel it's quite sensitive once you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.810 
but I feel it's quite sensitive once you
touch<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.770> it's<00:02:59.490> that<00:03:00.060> ok<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.470> fast<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
touch it it's that ok so it's fast and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.030 
touch it it's that ok so it's fast and
this<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> technology<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:04.620> who<00:03:04.770> who's

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
this is a technology from who who's

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.770 
this is a technology from who who's
making<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.490> sensors<00:03:06.530> I'm<00:03:07.530> not<00:03:08.280> quite<00:03:08.610> sure

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
making this sensors I'm not quite sure

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.450 
making this sensors I'm not quite sure
to<00:03:09.780> see<00:03:09.930> oh<00:03:09.960> maybe<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.560> supplier<00:03:11.430> of

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
to see oh maybe it's a supplier of

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.790 
to see oh maybe it's a supplier of
something<00:03:12.270> yeah<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.630> think<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.230> supply<00:03:13.590> but

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
something yeah I think it's a supply but

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.620 
something yeah I think it's a supply but
I'm<00:03:13.950> not<00:03:14.100> quite<00:03:14.310> sure<00:03:14.340> because<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.240> an<00:03:15.330> idea

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
I'm not quite sure because is it an idea

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.120 
I'm not quite sure because is it an idea
for<00:03:15.960> how<00:03:15.990> much<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.380> going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.590> cost<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.100> how

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
for how much is going to cost and how

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.970 
for how much is going to cost and how
soon<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> be<00:03:17.880> marketed<00:03:18.420> oh<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:19.590> think

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
soon is going to be marketed oh I think

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.100 
soon is going to be marketed oh I think
for<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.430> specific<00:03:20.760> points<00:03:21.570> i'm<00:03:21.750> too<00:03:21.960> cheap

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
specialized hopefully soon and hopefully

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.330 
specialized hopefully soon and hopefully
not<00:03:26.760> too<00:03:26.910> expensive<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.420> me<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.530> cool<00:03:28.770> yeah

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
not too expensive for me it's cool yeah

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.010 
not too expensive for me it's cool yeah
it's<00:03:29.490> very<00:03:29.670> cool<00:03:29.910> yeah<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.570> good<00:03:30.780> for

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
it's very cool yeah it's good for

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.520 
it's very cool yeah it's good for
education<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.680> everything<00:03:32.280> yeah
