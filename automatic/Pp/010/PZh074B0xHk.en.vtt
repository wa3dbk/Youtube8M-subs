00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Grande when we photographed him so what

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.089 
Grande when we photographed him so what
we're<00:00:13.049> gonna<00:00:13.139> do<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.590> select<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
we're gonna do is to select the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.970 
we're gonna do is to select the
background<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.790> back<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.120> him<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.619> delete<00:00:16.619> it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
background and back of him and delete it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680 
background and back of him and delete it
the<00:00:17.340> simplest<00:00:17.910> way<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> select<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the simplest way to select the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
the simplest way to select the
background<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.439> case<00:00:19.500> would<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.010> using

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
background in this case would be using

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.890 
background in this case would be using
the<00:00:20.400> magic<00:00:20.760> wand<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.390> course<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the magic wand of course there are a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.120 
the magic wand of course there are a
number<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> tools<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.800> could<00:00:22.920> use<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
number of tools that you could use to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.040 
number of tools that you could use to
create<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> path<00:00:23.910> around<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> image<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
create a path around the image of the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.040 
create a path around the image of the
character<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.210> magic<00:00:27.570> wand<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
character but the magic wand in this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.660 
character but the magic wand in this
instance<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> fastest<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
instance is going to go the fastest and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.910 
instance is going to go the fastest and
it's<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> most<00:00:30.060> easy<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.570> use<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.050> my

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's the most easy to use and my

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.450 
it's the most easy to use and my
background<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:33.090> color<00:00:34.190> which<00:00:35.190> allows

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
background is all one color which allows

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.549 
background is all one color which allows
me<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.850> use<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.329> magic<00:00:36.690> wand<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> very

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
me to use the magic wand and very

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
quickly select all the areas that I want

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.209 
quickly select all the areas that I want
to<00:00:40.500> delete<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.040> back<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> character<00:00:42.000> okay

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
to delete and back of the character okay

to delete and back of the character okay
I've<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> selection<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.149> I've<00:00:45.270> created<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
I've got a selection and I've created a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.299 
I've got a selection and I've created a
work<00:00:45.960> path<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
work path out of it so that's that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
work path out of it so that's that
selection<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.629> saved<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.170> come

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
selection can be can be saved and come

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
selection can be can be saved and come
back<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.770> later<00:00:50.210> let's<00:00:51.210> open<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.510> our<00:00:51.660> image<00:00:51.960> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
see the outline of poncho how do we get

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.770 
see the outline of poncho how do we get
him<00:01:12.540> back<00:01:12.570> well<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.049> turn<00:01:13.320> his<00:01:13.920> layer<00:01:14.750> into<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
him back well we turn his layer into a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 
him back well we turn his layer into a
layer<00:01:16.049> by<00:01:16.229> giving<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> name<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.479> comes

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
layer by giving it a name so that comes

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.880 
layer by giving it a name so that comes
from<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> background<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.470> turns<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
from the background it turns into a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
from the background it turns into a
layer<00:01:20.360> drag<00:01:21.360> him<00:01:21.600> above<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> layer<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
layer drag him above the layer of the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.710 
layer drag him above the layer of the
sky<00:01:24.140> go<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> path<00:01:26.090> turn<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> path<00:01:27.420> into<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sky go to the path turn the path into a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.550 
sky go to the path turn the path into a
selection<00:01:29.000> come<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> layers<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.990> hit

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
selection come back to layers and hit

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
selection come back to layers and hit
the<00:01:31.680> Delete<00:01:31.979> key<00:01:33.110> up<00:01:34.110> comes<00:01:34.470> our<00:01:34.650> sky<00:01:35.479> hit<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the Delete key up comes our sky hit a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
the Delete key up comes our sky hit a
command<00:01:36.900> D<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.670> course

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
command D and there we are now of course

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
command D and there we are now of course
you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> clean<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you can go in and clean up some of the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.600 
you can go in and clean up some of the
edges<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.250> various<00:01:42.000> tools<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
edges here with various tools to make it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
edges here with various tools to make it
look<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:44.909> natural<00:01:45.350> against<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> sky<00:01:47.869> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
look more natural against the sky and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289 
look more natural against the sky and
that's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> very<00:01:49.259> simple<00:01:49.680> manner<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.210> I'll

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that's a very simple manner and I'll

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.020 
that's a very simple manner and I'll
show<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> our<00:01:51.750> final<00:01:52.229> image<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.340> poncho<00:01:53.820> a
