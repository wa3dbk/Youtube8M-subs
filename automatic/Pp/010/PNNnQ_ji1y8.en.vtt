 the channel then that 's a very good thing 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.460
 I'm sure many of you 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.960
 they are musicians not necessarily have 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.410
 studied but the guitar is not played 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.690
 of the bass and this rock blog is about 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.180
 how to form a rock band some 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.950
 tips and things that maybe you should not do 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.899
 when you're in a rock band but 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.350
 good as music lovers I guess 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.719
 what has gone through your mind or maybe already 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.059
 you have it in plain the idea of ​​having a 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.430
 rock band and usually everything starts 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.289
 when they give you your first instrument 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.620
 as for example it can be your first 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.170
 guitar or your first battery or the first 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.480
 bass or your first acoustic guitar you 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.119
 first drilling machine your first drilling machine 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.220
 double your first external hard drive your 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.060
 first medal god bless these 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.060
 first instruments 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.390
 You've seen I got a guitar 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.420
 new matching 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.030
 I have gone and yes if I buy another 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.850
 guitar and we started making songs 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.700
 today, wait, no, no, he played 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.120
 battery so you're right you're right 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.400
 let's tell him to form a band 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.330
 and that's how most of the big ones 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.330
 bands start 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.100
 The first thing you should avoid is not 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.960
 show off because that's not nice and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.850
 more so if you do not have to show off and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
 you have just started you have nothing and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.110
 not only in musicians but in people 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.270
 generally do not do it because they look 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.659
 too stupid and the people to whom 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.329
 he is presumed he realizes then 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.880
 not another of the things that I think that 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.560
 we must avoid always want to sound more 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.020
 strong than others and this is 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.420
 especially for guitarists and a 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.859
 opaque guitarist does all that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.299
 happens when you start when you're 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.280
 starting and you do not have much experience 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.200
 we usually do that I used to do 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.750
 quite and when a new one starts the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.720
 band as you do not think it's that important 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.739
 but it is very important to be all 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.360
 leveled and have a fixed sound and 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.150
 understandable otherwise we can not 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.069
 forget is the time to write a 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.829
 song do it really, nothing else 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.959
 Try to write it because it's going to 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.489
 end up being a fill-in song or 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.470
 a song that you will not enjoy 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.470
 final because it has no meaning 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.390
 to one 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.000
 whether you compose this only with your 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.790
 band I think to make a song what 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.880
 more sincere that you can and you do not have to 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.590
 talk about love or anything if too much 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.470
 deep but something that really you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.260
 create or feel something that is always going to 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.010
 exist will be rivalry with others 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.680
 bands 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.260
 this is imminent and will happen in some 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.480
 then my advice is do not listen no 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.970
 listen to criticism or ccoo respond 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.440
 to rivalries because they're not going to 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.300
 carry anywhere are not good and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.430
 try to avoid them as much as you can 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.489
 Now let's say we have passed the phase 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.560
 to start a band already has its 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.290
 own songs but how to know if already 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.810
 you left the beginner stage you have passed 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.209
 the beginner stage if your vocalist 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.650
 stop screaming like crazy once the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.540
 vocalist realizes that it is not so 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.880
 good singing unless there's 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.620
 studied singing was another thing that you 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.959
 indicates that you have already passed the stage 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.610
 beginner you stop taking pictures of 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.280
 all your team this is pretty 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.590
 beginner to my liking maybe I do not know 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.270
 you what they think gather all your 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.520
 guitars all together 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.520
 all your speakers next to the battery 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.390
 I do not know it's like a materialistic form 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.670
 to say we can do it and I think 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.920
 that really does not matter the equipment that 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 have then I think if you have left 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 to do that you have passed the stage 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.720
 beginner reviews are you going to get 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.970
 too many from good opinions up 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.830
 bad maybe they make fun of you so they 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.810
 you want I do not know but then good to 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.510
 In the end I think I think that 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.040
 there are two types of people who 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.820
 they do what they want and they are not afraid 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.400
 to say it and the others that are saved 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.180
 everything and do not do or say what they want 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 truly 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.190
 and give it a like if you liked this 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.720
 video and if you do not do nothing you can 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.600
 share it with your musician friends or with 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.790
 Whoever you want, I also invite you to 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.530
 subscribe to this channel if you're not 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.860
 subscribed and wants to continue seeing more 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.810
 videos of these and I think that would be 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.810
 all for today until the next replay
