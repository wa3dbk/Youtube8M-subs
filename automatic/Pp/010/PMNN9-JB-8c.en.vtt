 are 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.380
 the new round 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.099
 wants to sensitize 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.490

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 the giants are not in danger 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.960
 we are faced with an unexpected situation 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 Two people died in the south should be about plants

 The public should not think that they have the sense of a project 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.630
 to be possible 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.130

 if that would be possible if we had the entire Bureau 4 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.159

 It was also noticeable that citizens understand 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.950
 what happens now 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.670
