00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
barley kernels and just boil them for a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360 
barley kernels and just boil them for a
little<00:00:38.820> while<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.739> mix<00:00:40.920> the

little while in water and then mix the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.450 
little while in water and then mix the
barley<00:00:42.120> tasting<00:00:42.600> water<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> almonds<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
barley tasting water with the almonds to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
barley tasting water with the almonds to
produce<00:00:44.610> kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> almond<00:00:45.510> milk<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
produce kind of almond milk thing and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
produce kind of almond milk thing and
then<00:00:47.160> finish<00:00:47.700> by<00:00:47.730> straining<00:00:48.329> also<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
then finish by straining also the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
then finish by straining also the
element<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.280> liquid

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
element of the way so we have a liquid

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
element of the way so we have a liquid
which<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.329> quite<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.050> like

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
which is going to look quite a lot like

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.250 
which is going to look quite a lot like
milk<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.160> opaque<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.260> that's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
milk it's going to be opaque and that's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
milk it's going to be opaque and that's
going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> cool<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:55.829> mixed<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.280> Pernod

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
going to cool down mixed with Pernod

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
going to cool down mixed with Pernod
answered<00:00:57.059> over<00:00:57.210> ice<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> water<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
answered over ice so now the water is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
answered over ice so now the water is
boiling<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> put<00:01:00.109> somehow<00:01:01.109> barley

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
boiling it's time to put somehow barley

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
boiling it's time to put somehow barley
into<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.910> reason<00:01:03.210> why<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> barley

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
into it and the reason why the barley

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.010 
into it and the reason why the barley
into<00:01:04.589> boiling<00:01:04.890> water<00:01:05.100> instead<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> cold<00:01:06.810> water

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
into boiling water instead of cold water

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.500 
into boiling water instead of cold water
is<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:08.100> don't<00:01:08.220> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.909> reate<00:01:09.240> too<00:01:09.360> much

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
is that we don't want to reate too much

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
is that we don't want to reate too much
of<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> porridge<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.710> should<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> whole

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
of a porridge like it should be whole

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.120 
of a porridge like it should be whole
kernels<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.630> barley<00:01:13.290> floating<00:01:13.740> around<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
kernels of barley floating around in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.609 
kernels of barley floating around in
water<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> sort<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> seasoning<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> water<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
water and sort of seasoning the water so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.230 
water and sort of seasoning the water so
the<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> barley<00:01:17.340> has<00:01:17.430> boiled<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> couple

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the the barley has boiled for a couple

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.990 
the the barley has boiled for a couple
minutes<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.740> beginning<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.970> a

to feel a kind of a smell of cooked

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.190 
to feel a kind of a smell of cooked
grains<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.479> gonna<00:01:27.600> straighten<00:01:27.900> them

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
grains it's gonna straighten them

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380 
grains it's gonna straighten them
straight<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.310> mixture<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.150> I'm<00:01:30.210> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
straight into this mixture so I'm just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.710 
straight into this mixture so I'm just
really<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.810> use<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> cooking<00:01:31.799> liquid<00:01:32.720> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
really gonna use the cooking liquid so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
really gonna use the cooking liquid so
you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.549> bit

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.149 
you can see it's like a little bit
cloudy<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
cloudy and it has a little bit of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
cloudy and it has a little bit of
texture<00:01:38.460> from<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> starch<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.360> ask<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
texture from the starch to ask kind of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.469 
texture from the starch to ask kind of
been<00:01:40.140> cooked<00:01:40.380> now

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
been cooked now

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.800 
been cooked now
so<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.469> almonds<00:01:42.979> go<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.509> mixer<00:01:44.509> together

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
so the almonds go in the mixer together

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.800 
so the almonds go in the mixer together
with<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.460> cooking<00:01:46.460> liquid<00:01:46.670> from<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.090> barley

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.620 

and<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:52.280> almonds<00:01:52.700> there's<00:01:53.090> quite<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> lot<00:01:53.600> of

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
and in almonds there's quite a lot of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.959 
and in almonds there's quite a lot of
fat<00:01:53.929> so<00:01:54.409> when<00:01:54.679> this<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.189> now<00:01:55.310> mixed<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.850> gonna

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
fat so when this is now mixed it's gonna

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.639 
fat so when this is now mixed it's gonna
be<00:01:56.179> a<00:01:56.450> little<00:01:56.719> bit<00:01:56.810> like<00:01:56.960> creating<00:01:57.409> kind<00:01:57.560> of

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
be a little bit like creating kind of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.929 
be a little bit like creating kind of
artificial<00:01:58.189> milk<00:01:58.429> there's<00:01:58.640> going<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.789> be<00:01:58.850> a

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
artificial milk there's going to be a
