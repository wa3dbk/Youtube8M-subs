leave that open because that's where
you're<00:03:50.640> going<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.820> add<00:03:50.940> your<00:03:51.180> hook<00:03:52.730> or<00:03:53.730> your

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
you're going to add your hook or your

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.070 
you're going to add your hook or your
little<00:03:54.150> loopy

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.440 

okay<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:03.920> I'm<00:04:04.250> going<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.460> pull<00:04:04.670> out<00:04:04.790> some<00:04:04.820> 20

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
okay so I'm going to pull out some 20

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.650 
okay so I'm going to pull out some 20
gauge<00:04:05.480> wire<00:04:08.170> where's<00:04:09.170> my<00:04:09.440> lawyer<00:04:09.590> there<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.250> is

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.640 

okay<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:14.720> we're<00:04:14.960> just<00:04:14.990> going<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:15.380> make<00:04:15.590> a

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
okay so we're just going to make a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.470 
okay so we're just going to make a
couple<00:04:15.950> loops<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:22.250> I've<00:04:22.460> got<00:04:22.670> about<00:04:22.790> three

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
couple loops so I've got about three

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.590 
couple loops so I've got about three
inches<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.720> I'm<00:04:27.050> going<00:04:27.170> to<00:04:27.200> make<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:28.600> large

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
inches and I'm going to make a large

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:38.930 
inches and I'm going to make a large
loop

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.870 

bend<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.690> back

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:56.520 

read<00:04:43.720> on

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.680 

and<00:04:57.100> we<00:04:57.310> want<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.730> loop<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.150> go<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.450> same

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
and we want this loop to go in the same

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.130 
and we want this loop to go in the same
direction<00:04:59.820> but<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:00.970> opposite<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.750> twisted

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
direction but the opposite so I twisted

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.240 
direction but the opposite so I twisted
this<00:05:02.290> one<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:02.620> way<00:05:02.770> I'm<00:05:02.860> going<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.040> twist

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
this one this way I'm going to twist

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:20.309 
this one this way I'm going to twist
that<00:05:03.310> one<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.610> other<00:05:03.730> way

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.409 

okay<00:05:21.159> and<00:05:21.339> then<00:05:21.430> this<00:05:21.550> one<00:05:21.789> that's<00:05:21.939> not<00:05:22.119> really

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
okay and then this one that's not really

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.089 
okay and then this one that's not really
that<00:05:22.599> pretty<00:05:22.809> I'm<00:05:23.110> going<00:05:23.469> to<00:05:23.529> do<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:23.919> in

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
that pretty I'm going to do that in

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.019 
that pretty I'm going to do that in
between<00:05:26.009> okay<00:05:27.009> so<00:05:27.069> I'm<00:05:27.369> going<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.580> open<00:05:27.849> these

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
between okay so I'm going to open these

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:35.790 
between okay so I'm going to open these
to<00:05:29.460> add<00:05:30.460> some<00:05:30.789> glue<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:34.259> then<00:05:35.259> put<00:05:35.619> that

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
to add some glue and then put that

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.359 
to add some glue and then put that
little<00:05:35.919> loop<00:05:36.249> in<00:05:36.430> there<00:05:40.949> make<00:05:41.949> sure<00:05:41.979> it's

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369 
little loop in there make sure it's

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:48.719 
little loop in there make sure it's
straight<00:05:45.749> and<00:05:46.749> now<00:05:47.379> all<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.860> do<00:05:48.039> is<00:05:48.069> glue<00:05:48.580> on

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
straight and now all you do is glue on

00:05:48.729 --> 00:06:36.660 
straight and now all you do is glue on
your<00:05:49.259> centers

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.060
