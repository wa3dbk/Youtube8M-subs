the<00:03:21.570> plastic<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.080> spitting<00:03:22.440> out<00:03:22.590> it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the plastic is spitting out it's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.710 
the plastic is spitting out it's
probably<00:03:23.459> going<00:03:23.700> into<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> product<00:03:24.540> that

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
probably going into the product that

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.210 
probably going into the product that
you're<00:03:24.900> putting<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.200> your<00:03:25.260> face<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> fact

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
you're putting on your face so the fact

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.670 
you're putting on your face so the fact
that<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.700> not<00:03:27.420> plastic<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:28.470> just

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
that this is not plastic it's just

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.470 
that this is not plastic it's just
really<00:03:28.830> great<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:29.549> have<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.850> worry

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
really great and you don't have to worry

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.120 
really great and you don't have to worry
about<00:03:30.630> anything<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.860> i<00:03:31.920> really

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
about anything like that and i really

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.830 
about anything like that and i really
like<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.489> because<00:03:32.640> it's<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.030> liquid<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.750> you

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
like this because it's a liquid so you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080 
like this because it's a liquid so you
just<00:03:34.230> kind<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.130> has<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> smaller<00:03:35.760> hole

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
just kind of like it has a smaller hole

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.789 
just kind of like it has a smaller hole
in<00:03:36.239> there<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:36.989> go<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:37.530> on

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
in there and you just go like this on

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.590 
in there and you just go like this on
your<00:03:38.010> finger<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.489> then<00:03:38.850> apply<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.510> your

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
your finger and then apply it to your

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.900 
your finger and then apply it to your
face<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.170> again<00:03:40.650> since<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.160> liquid<00:03:41.610> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
face and again since it's a liquid it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.330 
face and again since it's a liquid it
absorbs<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.900> quickly<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.709> don't<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.100> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
absorbs so quickly so you don't have to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.310 
absorbs so quickly so you don't have to
like<00:03:44.549> rub<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> cream<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.930> wait<00:03:46.049> for<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.290> to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
like rub a cream in and wait for it to

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.320 
like rub a cream in and wait for it to
set<00:03:46.590> or<00:03:46.739> anything<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.070> that<00:03:47.220> instantly<00:03:48.030> it's

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
set or anything like that instantly it's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.199 
set or anything like that instantly it's
just<00:03:48.690> going<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.250> soak<00:03:50.250> into<00:03:50.489> your<00:03:50.640> skin<00:03:50.970> which

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
just going to soak into your skin which

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.660 
just going to soak into your skin which
is<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.540> great<00:03:51.840> because<00:03:52.049> i<00:03:52.620> have<00:03:52.950> applied<00:03:53.340> a

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
is really great because i have applied a

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.220 
is really great because i have applied a
cream<00:03:54.120> before<00:03:54.360> for<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> spa<00:03:55.170> treatment

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
cream before for like a spa treatment

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.949 
cream before for like a spa treatment
and<00:03:55.830> since<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:56.730> thick<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.269> doesn't<00:03:57.600> sit

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
and since it's so thick it doesn't sit

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.170 
and since it's so thick it doesn't sit
right<00:03:58.040> underneath<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.519> makeup<00:03:59.760> and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
right underneath my makeup and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.270 
right underneath my makeup and
foundation<00:04:00.570> doesn't<00:04:01.170> even<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.709> blend<00:04:02.040> into

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
foundation doesn't even like blend into

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.979 
foundation doesn't even like blend into
that<00:04:02.549> spot<00:04:02.820> very<00:04:02.970> well<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.600> makes<00:04:03.750> that

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
that spot very well so it makes that

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.840 
that spot very well so it makes that
spot<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.440> you're<00:04:04.560> trying<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.830> hide<00:04:05.040> even

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
spot that you're trying to hide even

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.880 
spot that you're trying to hide even
more<00:04:06.030> obvious<00:04:06.239> with<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> cream<00:04:07.080> from<00:04:07.440> my

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
more obvious with a cream from my

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.410 
more obvious with a cream from my
experience<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.579> fact<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.060> just

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
experience of the fact that this just

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.720 
experience of the fact that this just
soaks<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.810> right<00:04:09.959> away<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.769> amazing<00:04:12.470> and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
diminish that so that's just really cool

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.390 
diminish that so that's just really cool
that<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:27.380> can<00:04:27.530> be<00:04:27.650> applied<00:04:27.710> on<00:04:28.069> top<00:04:28.100> of

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
that that can be applied on top of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.890 
that that can be applied on top of
makeup<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:28.970> then<00:04:29.120> they<00:04:29.270> gave<00:04:29.449> me<00:04:29.599> a<00:04:29.630> little

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
makeup and then they gave me a little

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.360 
makeup and then they gave me a little
sample<00:04:30.349> this<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.599> total<00:04:32.599> moisture<00:04:33.370> facial

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
sample this is the total moisture facial

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.330 
sample this is the total moisture facial
cream<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.810> almost<00:04:36.169> purchased<00:04:36.889> this<00:04:36.979> before

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
cream and I almost purchased this before

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.980 
cream and I almost purchased this before
but<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.580> think<00:04:37.880> this<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.240> little<00:04:38.539> bit

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
but I think this is a little bit

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.860 
but I think this is a little bit
expensive<00:04:39.560> like<00:04:39.979> 40<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.819> 45<00:04:41.539> doll<00:04:41.720> or

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
expensive like 40 to 45 doll or

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.540 
expensive like 40 to 45 doll or
something<00:04:42.020> like<00:04:42.289> that<00:04:42.349> so<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:43.009> got<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> sample

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
something like that so I got a sample

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.650 
something like that so I got a sample
which<00:04:43.819> is<00:04:43.940> really<00:04:44.150> great<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.449> definitely

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
which is really great I definitely

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.050 
which is really great I definitely
recommend<00:04:45.470> buying<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.669> travel-size

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
recommend buying like travel-size

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.480 
recommend buying like travel-size
products<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:47.870> trying<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.620> get<00:04:48.710> samples<00:04:49.250> of

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
products and trying to get samples of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.159 
products and trying to get samples of
things<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.060> are<00:04:50.150> expensive<00:04:50.419> before<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.020> buy

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
things that are expensive before you buy

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.379 
things that are expensive before you buy
that<00:04:51.410> because<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.400> never<00:04:52.580> know<00:04:52.759> if<00:04:53.030> you're

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
that because you never know if you're

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.749 
that because you never know if you're
going<00:04:53.539> to<00:04:53.630> like<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.840> or<00:04:54.050> not<00:04:54.229> so<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:55.160> is<00:04:55.370> it

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
going to like it or not so this is it
