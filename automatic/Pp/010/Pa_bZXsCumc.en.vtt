00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
outer edges and with this you can almost

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.070 
outer edges and with this you can almost
Pat<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:21.849> first<00:02:22.090> its<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.750> real

you<00:03:37.060> conceal<00:03:37.480> really<00:03:37.810> well<00:03:39.269> now<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.329> think

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
you conceal really well now I think

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.509 
you conceal really well now I think
under<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.139> I'm<00:03:41.410> going<00:03:41.949> to<00:03:42.010> use<00:03:42.160> some<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.489> that

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
under the I'm going to use some of that

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.699 
under the I'm going to use some of that
brown<00:03:42.879> liner<00:03:43.269> instead<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.959> black<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:44.620> so

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
brown liner instead of black just so

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.319 
brown liner instead of black just so
it's<00:03:44.889> not<00:03:45.069> so<00:03:45.549> much<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:48.099> focus<00:03:48.760> on<00:03:48.910> under<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
it's not so much to focus on under the

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.720 
it's not so much to focus on under the
eye<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.870> then<00:03:50.290> smudge<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.919> with<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.220> end<00:03:51.370> of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
eye and then smudge it with the end of

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.170 
eye and then smudge it with the end of
the<00:03:52.120> brush<00:03:52.329> and<00:03:52.919> to<00:03:53.919> finish<00:03:54.220> off<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.519> look<00:03:54.669> I<00:03:54.879> I

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the brush and to finish off the look I I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.470 
the brush and to finish off the look I I
sometimes<00:03:55.660> don't<00:03:56.109> do<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.650> because<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:58.030> just

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
sometimes don't do this because it just

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.289 
sometimes don't do this because it just
closes<00:03:58.780> off<00:03:58.989> your<00:03:59.199> whole<00:03:59.379> I<00:03:59.530> but<00:04:00.459> for<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.060> look

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
closes off your whole I but for the look

closes off your whole I but for the look
I'm<00:04:01.599> already<00:04:01.870> here<00:04:02.169> and<00:04:02.260> might<00:04:02.379> as<00:04:02.470> well<00:04:02.590> do<00:04:02.739> it

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
I'm already here and might as well do it

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.449 
I'm already here and might as well do it
I'll<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.190> do<00:04:03.340> my<00:04:03.370> waterline<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.209> well<00:04:05.459> just

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
I'll just do my waterline as well just

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.680 
I'll just do my waterline as well just
to<00:04:06.790> make<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.180> more<00:04:07.359> fall<00:04:09.180> finish<00:04:10.180> off<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.510> look

nights<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.419> I'm<00:04:22.419> going<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.600> place<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.139> just

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
nights and I'm going to place that just

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.659 
nights and I'm going to place that just
on<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.639> cheeks<00:04:29.220> another<00:04:30.220> thing<00:04:30.430> about<00:04:30.550> this

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
on the cheeks another thing about this

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.700 
on the cheeks another thing about this
bronze<00:04:31.060> or<00:04:31.270> two<00:04:31.449> is<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.750> like<00:04:31.960> how<00:04:32.169> it<00:04:32.410> kind<00:04:32.620> of

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
bronze or two is I like how it kind of

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.040 
bronze or two is I like how it kind of
has<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.009> gradient<00:04:33.550> there's<00:04:34.449> dark<00:04:34.810> on<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
has the gradient there's dark on the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.510 
has the gradient there's dark on the
bottom<00:04:35.320> so<00:04:35.500> it's<00:04:35.620> like<00:04:35.710> your<00:04:35.830> bronzer<00:04:36.280> color

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
bottom so it's like your bronzer color

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.070 
bottom so it's like your bronzer color
and<00:04:36.789> then<00:04:36.850> light<00:04:37.060> up<00:04:37.240> here<00:04:37.449> so<00:04:37.630> it's<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.810> natural

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
and then light up here so it's a natural

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.779 
and then light up here so it's a natural
highlight<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.889> don't<00:04:39.070> know<00:04:39.160> when<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.520> mix<00:04:39.639> the

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
highlight I don't know when you mix the

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.010 
highlight I don't know when you mix the
two<00:04:39.910> together<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.449> makes<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.780> really

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
two together and this makes a really

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.700 
two together and this makes a really
pretty<00:04:41.289> color<00:04:41.380> then<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.370> think<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:43.630> blush<00:04:44.380> I

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
pretty color then I think for blush I

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.860 
pretty color then I think for blush I
don't<00:04:44.979> want<00:04:45.160> anything<00:04:45.400> too<00:04:45.970> heavy<00:04:46.210> because<00:04:46.539> my

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
don't want anything too heavy because my

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.710 
don't want anything too heavy because my
eyes<00:04:47.020> already<00:04:47.320> pretty<00:04:47.860> heavy<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:48.880> I'm<00:04:49.240> going

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
eyes already pretty heavy so I'm going

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.529 
eyes already pretty heavy so I'm going
to<00:04:49.780> use<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.410> cam<00:04:50.590> naquan<00:04:50.979> fira<00:04:51.430> mango<00:04:52.210> blush

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
to use the cam naquan fira mango blush

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.830 
to use the cam naquan fira mango blush
and<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:54.100> fan<00:04:54.460> brush<00:04:54.729> just<00:04:55.150> because<00:04:55.389> I<00:04:55.419> like<00:04:55.720> I

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
and a fan brush just because I like I

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.300 
and a fan brush just because I like I
said<00:04:55.990> in<00:04:56.080> other<00:04:56.169> videos<00:04:56.289> this<00:04:56.830> just<00:04:57.039> gives<00:04:57.160> you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
said in other videos this just gives you

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.270 
said in other videos this just gives you
a<00:04:57.340> little<00:04:57.430> bit<00:04:57.550> more<00:04:57.699> control<00:04:58.740> with<00:04:59.740> work<00:05:00.010> like

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
a little bit more control with work like

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.460 
a little bit more control with work like
placement<00:05:00.729> of<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:00.940> lush<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.419> then<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.870> think

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
placement of the lush and then I think

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.260 
placement of the lush and then I think
I'll<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.710> little<00:05:09.070> bit<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.280> contouring<00:05:09.940> just

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
I'll do a little bit of contouring just

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.909 
I'll do a little bit of contouring just
because<00:05:10.600> it's<00:05:10.750> fall<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.110> we<00:05:11.530> can<00:05:11.680> get<00:05:11.830> away

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
because it's fall and we can get away

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.129 
because it's fall and we can get away
with<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.460> now<00:05:12.760> not<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.479> you<00:05:13.630> can't<00:05:13.780> in<00:05:14.020> the

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
with that now not that you can't in the

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.230 
with that now not that you can't in the
summer<00:05:14.410> but<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:15.520> makes<00:05:15.699> me<00:05:15.820> feel<00:05:15.970> better

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
summer but just makes me feel better

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.300 
summer but just makes me feel better
when<00:05:16.449> I<00:05:16.479> contour<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:17.320> I'm<00:05:17.470> taking<00:05:17.620> my<00:05:17.949> medium

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
when I contour so I'm taking my medium

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.070 
when I contour so I'm taking my medium
