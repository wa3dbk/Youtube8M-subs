00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
pro circuit header there should be a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.290 
pro circuit header there should be a
stud<00:00:22.199> which<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.369> set<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> motor<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
stud which when I set the motor off to

stud which when I set the motor off to
get<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> worked<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.869> there's<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.500> stud<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
get it worked on there's a stud in a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.910 
get it worked on there's a stud in a
bolt<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.310> goes<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:27.410> when<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.470> sent<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> motor

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
bolt that goes in when I sent the motor

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410 
bolt that goes in when I sent the motor
off<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.369> worked<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:30.060> took<00:00:30.240> out

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
off to get it worked on they took out

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.410 
off to get it worked on they took out
this<00:00:30.570> though<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.700> they<00:00:32.700> claimed<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.180> sent

I'm not going to tighten it down get the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920 
I'm not going to tighten it down get the
stud<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.200> order<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.910> won't<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.300> told

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
stud on order but it won't be here told

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.130 
stud on order but it won't be here told
well<00:00:43.320> she's<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.340> week<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.510> let's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that's gonna be good enough for now next

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.970 
that's gonna be good enough for now next
thing<00:00:53.070> we're<00:00:53.280> gonna<00:00:53.340> put<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> actual

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
thing we're gonna put on is the actual

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
thing we're gonna put on is the actual
slip-on<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> probably<00:00:57.989> should

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
slip-on and really I probably should

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.580 
slip-on and really I probably should
wait<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> put<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.500> on

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
wait for this but I want to put it on

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.440 
wait for this but I want to put it on
down<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> wanna<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.460> looks<00:01:02.489> like

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.850 

with<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.600> aftermarket<00:01:09.990> slip<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.770> just

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with an aftermarket slip on it's just

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.000 
with an aftermarket slip on it's just
like<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> name<00:01:11.400> implies<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.799> don't

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
like the name implies you actually don't

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880 
like the name implies you actually don't
use<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.330> stock<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> gasket<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
use the stock one has a gasket in a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.630 
use the stock one has a gasket in a
clamp

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
clamp

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
clamp
with<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> aftermarket<00:01:18.810> ones<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.470> use

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
with the aftermarket ones you don't use

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270 
with the aftermarket ones you don't use
a<00:01:19.759> clamp<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> gasket<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> simply<00:01:22.920> slips

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a clamp or a gasket it just simply slips

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.200 
a clamp or a gasket it just simply slips
over<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.030> header<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:25.700> if<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.150> any

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
over the header now if you do get any

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
over the header now if you do get any
leakages<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> put<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
leakages out of there you can put a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.160 
leakages out of there you can put a
clamp<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> stock<00:01:30.540> clamp<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:31.049> not

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
clamp on it but the stock clamp will not

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.819 
clamp on it but the stock clamp will not
work<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> too<00:01:31.770> big<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.329> gasket

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.539 

it's<00:01:40.829> too<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.979> there<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> got<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.280> slip

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it's too big so there you got it slip

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's too big so there you got it slip
down<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> back<00:01:45.720> section<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:47.750> you'll

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
down in the back section here you'll

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.870 
down in the back section here you'll
notice<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> mounting<00:01:49.950> has<00:01:50.220> changed<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.909> bit

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.170 

we<00:01:57.330> actually<00:01:57.510> use<00:01:57.870> a<00:01:58.729> clamp<00:01:59.729> that's<00:01:59.940> got

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
we actually use a clamp that's got

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.960 
we actually use a clamp that's got
rubber<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.080> inside<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.620> just<00:02:01.970> look

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
rubber on the inside of it just look

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.029 
rubber on the inside of it just look
that<00:02:03.180> over<00:02:04.280> goes<00:02:05.280> one<00:02:05.550> way<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.620> you<00:02:07.979> can

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that over goes one way and then you can

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.120 
that over goes one way and then you can
use<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.310> stock<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:10.820> hold<00:02:12.140> put<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> lift

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
use your stock and not hold put it lift

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.460 
use your stock and not hold put it lift
it<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.340> where<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.550> needs<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> go<00:02:15.170> plant<00:02:16.170> butt<00:02:16.320> in

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
it up where it needs to go plant butt in

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.840
