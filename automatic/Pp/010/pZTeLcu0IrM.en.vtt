00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
tank which is kind of also a different

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.739 
tank which is kind of also a different
variation<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.909> so<00:00:51.179> instead<00:00:51.449> having<00:00:51.629> this

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
variation like so instead having this

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.169 
variation like so instead having this
big<00:00:51.929> main<00:00:52.199> gun<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.339> got<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.030> the

thing let's do is just raise yourself up
off<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> ground<00:01:36.480> so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.980> slab

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
off the ground so you can get in a slab

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.940 
off the ground so you can get in a slab
like<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.720> forward<00:01:40.140> by<00:01:40.230> 10<00:01:40.470> 0<00:01:40.740> 1

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
like this then just go forward by 10 0 1

you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.480> 9<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.960> go<00:01:46.050> 1<00:01:46.230> 2<00:01:46.440> 3<00:01:46.470> 4<00:01:46.860> 5<00:01:47.130> 6<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.640> 8<00:01:47.820> 9

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you can have 9 to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 9

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
you can have 9 to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 8 9
so<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.510> bracket<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.990> still<00:01:49.280> configure<00:01:50.280> there

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so the bracket is still configure there

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.820 
so the bracket is still configure there
but<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.240> forwards<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.470> 7

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
but it's one forwards this is actually 7

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.700 
but it's one forwards this is actually 7
wide<00:01:52.980> and<00:01:53.160> total<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.670> 1<00:01:53.820> 2<00:01:53.850> 3<00:01:54.090> 4<00:01:54.810> 5<00:01:55.320> 6

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
wide and total so you have 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.610 
wide and total so you have 1 2 3 4 5 6
and<00:01:56.010> 7<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.360> end<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.230> going<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
and 7 and that end one here is going to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.840 
and 7 and that end one here is going to
have<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.130> 9<00:01:59.730> again<00:02:00.000> sing<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> 1<00:02:00.450> 2<00:02:00.780> 3<00:02:01.170> 4<00:02:01.530> 5<00:02:01.800> 6<00:02:02.070> 7<00:02:02.430> 8<00:02:02.580> 9

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
have a 9 again sing a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.719 
have a 9 again sing a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
and<00:02:03.090> next<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.110> will<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.260> 10<00:02:04.560> 1<00:02:04.800> 2<00:02:04.980> 3<00:02:05.130> 4<00:02:05.430> 5<00:02:05.610> 6<00:02:05.850> 7<00:02:06.000> 8

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
and next one will be 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.369 
and next one will be 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
ten<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:08.190> lot<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.940> Islam<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.539> Calphalon<00:02:11.050> but<00:02:11.290> you

of<00:03:20.530> free<00:03:20.769> get<00:03:21.310> here<00:03:21.519> then<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.760> got<00:03:21.850> these<00:03:22.000> two

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
of free get here then you got these two

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.550 
of free get here then you got these two
rays<00:03:22.450> bits<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.989> gives<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.319> little<00:03:23.350> bit

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
rays bits it just gives it a little bit

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.140 
rays bits it just gives it a little bit
more<00:03:23.799> detail<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.569> here<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:25.810> just<00:03:26.680> want<00:03:27.150> like

to get upside down stairs and of these

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.250 
to get upside down stairs and of these
pass<00:03:51.670> here<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:52.599> use<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> stone<00:03:53.079> slab

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
pass here you just use a stone slab

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.500 
pass here you just use a stone slab
going<00:03:53.590> across<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:54.040> can<00:03:54.069> actually<00:03:54.370> cut<00:03:54.579> down

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
going across you can actually cut down

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.740 
going across you can actually cut down
into<00:03:56.319> these<00:03:56.680> two<00:03:56.889> parts<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:57.370> as<00:03:57.489> well<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.690> they

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
into these two parts now as well so they

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.599 
into these two parts now as well so they
actually<00:03:58.900> have<00:03:59.139> got<00:03:59.319> a<00:03:59.349> small<00:03:59.650> area<00:03:59.829> as<00:04:00.069> you<00:04:00.310> do

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
actually have got a small area as you do

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.930 
actually have got a small area as you do
and<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:01.780> here<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.440> go<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.760> there's

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
and this one here and the go so there's

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.629 
and this one here and the go so there's
a<00:04:04.000> small<00:04:04.239> kind<00:04:04.419> of<00:04:04.510> way<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.989> get<00:04:05.139> in<00:04:05.400> here<00:04:06.400> and

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
a small kind of way to get in here and

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.069 
a small kind of way to get in here and
of<00:04:06.730> course<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:07.000> could<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.780> when<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:07.989> get

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
around to it a trapdoor in here I wasn't

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.140 
around to it a trapdoor in here I wasn't
too<00:04:11.139> keen<00:04:11.319> on<00:04:11.440> lined<00:04:11.709> up<00:04:11.859> putting<00:04:12.099> in<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.819> and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
too keen on lined up putting in this and

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.270 
too keen on lined up putting in this and
this<00:04:13.239> one<00:04:13.419> does<00:04:13.599> have<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.810> trapdoor<00:04:14.129> which<00:04:15.129> is

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
this one does have a trapdoor which is

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.009 
this one does have a trapdoor which is
exactly<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.730> same<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.359> then<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.810> this

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
exactly the same so then this is this
