 are you going to show in this video how 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.000
 so you would make this pillow among other things 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.250
 I'm really sick for three days very 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.110

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 sorry that maybe so a little less 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 excited about come or my voice whole 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
 very annoying among DIY videos and me 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.689
 always do voiceover and then i tell 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 just what i do they also with this 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.040
 I am very sorry 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.880
 but I just can't do that much 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.380
 to put on 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 and I do not want the sun over slim 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.470
 a videos or something so that we absolutely go 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.820
 do not 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.229
 so we have to settle for that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 with this voice yes and let rios then 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 just move on to the dr white's and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.790
 the clean up thingy storage 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.370
 home decor what to learn from tilburg 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.610
 look 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.960
 if not like the first diy that 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.000
 I have for you is a very nice one 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.710
 make the flowerpot a little more fun 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.210
 of course a white flower is always 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.070
 very nice and clean when you just get there 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.450
 a flower but I wanted him 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.460
 just a little bit more fun 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.810
 and I will do that with what you nail polish 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.790
 does is a tank with warm water 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.619
 drop it and there you sprinkle like it 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 ware the nail polish over and like you 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.100
 sees nail polish float 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.930
 I use 4 different pastel shades 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.130
 because i just pastel very much 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.690
 good at fitting in with spring and when you have the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.400
 have done nailing in the water like 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.260
 you will well and I'm just 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.930
 a little sprinkled then you go whole 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.700
 very slowly with the pot in the water 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.390
 Buy it again and again very slowly 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.740
 from 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.910
 and as you can see , a nail polish remains 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.530
 stick to the pot and now you need it 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.420
 just leave it for a few hours 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.740
 drying and as you can see you have one 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.740
 very nice flowerpot 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.269
 and the following video where is really one 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.890
 very nice estimator what you need 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.019
 for example, is a letter or something 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.480
 otherwise you want to decorate and 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.760
 all roses but the big one I thought 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.140
 just a little too big so for the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.359
 chosen little ones and I really think so 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.519
 very cute and I also chose 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:09.200
 I found one for the white and the pink 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.459
 very nice and cute combination and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.230
 my roses have a sort of 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.069
 stalk because you like that very much 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.269
 and attach 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.609
 but we have to take the stalk 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.959
 stretching and I'm going to do that now 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.959
 with all the roses that I will use 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.750
 then the florets will stick and stick 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.130
 I used my glue gun 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.140
 You can also just do one or two that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.670
 so use second glue 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.110
 work very well but I have one 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.770
 glue gun so I use it whole 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.510
 gladly 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.820
 I started with a glue on a rose 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.950
 and then the east press the letter 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.840
 but yes that didn't work very well 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.460
 this became much nicer 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.350
 yes to do the line directly on the letter 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.000
 and then just the roses very quickly 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.860
 and so I just got the whole one 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.930
 letter done and as you see it is 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.060
 end result really super super cute 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.060
 I really love this letter 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.100
 The following diy I have for you 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.620
 has to do with this boring pillow that 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.000
 make money more fun with textile paint 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.440
 and of course I chose again 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.760
 the color pink 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.680
 I recommend that you do 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.060
 used rubber gloves but that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.470
 I have just not taken off 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.630
 because I don't like it at all 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.370
 beds and we only go pillowcase 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.370
 so paints where the kisses look 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.470
 and start with verve 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.540
 every textile paint is different i have this 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.820
 purchased with the action and each package 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.040
 supplied its own instruction so I advise you 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.660
 just pay attention to that 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.370
 along with packaging I had 500 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.980
 have milliliters of water 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.080
 and yes there the bag added 25 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.140
 grams of salt and that all went in one 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.670
 pan with the 5 liters of water but again 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.530
 always just read the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.790
 instructions for this 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.680
 this video is of course not about it 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.640
 how I use the textile paint but what 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.280
 I do with it 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.960
 so always read it well by going now 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.610
 the pillowcases in this like you 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.840
 looks it really has a super super 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.820
 nice color 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.050
 so I wanted to create a bit under 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.160
 what i did is just actually 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.230
 extinguish a bit 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.360
 but I am something more grams 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.320
 lead in the middle because it is nicer to 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.810
 to have more fun 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.090
 then this and because i have continued to be baptist 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.610
 the bottom remained in japan 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.740
 which means that the underside is somewhat pink 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.540
 tanja in the middle and you have to 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.830
 for under and of course and on the 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.360
 I had to pack a few minutes 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.610
 I have done that too and wait 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.830
 then I just flushed it out 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.120
 yes we prayed and the pillowcase I had 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.580
 wash with cold water 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.439
 I did that too 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.479
 the pillowcase can then be hung up and down 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:41.129
 let dry overnight and then this 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.169
 the end result I really like it 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.490
 become very nice and you can of course 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.110
 with a lot of different things 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.110
 we also do it with clothing 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.150
 now we come to a little with 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.560
 stored so shared it a bit 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.719
 clean up with the toll mountains 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.909
 that is of course very nice to whole 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.770
 Other products to explain it again 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.360
 is just a little nicer and just not 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.460
 cleaned up there if you put it in a basket 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.949
 and does this really nice basket liked it 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.330
 from 4 euros at the hema so here I have 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.740
 a bit of my daily things 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.669
 and I think it's really great 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.990
 cute 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.090
 so just that little bit easier with 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.219
 cleaning you just grab that container 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.789
 and you keep a cloth underneath and 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.789
 are you ready ? 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.180
 the next thing i don't want to tidy up 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.889
 my nail polish i have many nail polishes and 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.169
 these are only with essie lacquers until now 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.599
 but they always lie a bit 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.400
 scattered throughout the room and now I found 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.189
 a very nice bench with the xenos 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.949
 for 2 euros 50 I thought and fit here 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:38.779
 very nice in my nail polishes and yes too 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.779
 my nail polish remover and cotton pads 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.520
 and furthermore you have on roads yes the 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.160
 dark candle removes the buddha height 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.970
 and for that the place and nice 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.970
 put down flowers 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.630
 and shifted a bit to look 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.479
 how i want it 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.580
 and of course Easter eggs and a through 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.160
 I have to make a little purplish 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.560
 put some baby chicks down for that 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.820
 is of course completely purple and now find 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.960
 I just really enjoyed this a lot 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.960
 spot next to my couch 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.009
 that we have the DIY and storage and 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.780

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.220
 inspired by spring i hope so

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.360
 the video that just motivates me 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.590
 but to really clean up then I go 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.590
 namely actually do it 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.090
 I was hard was it was certainly 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.919
 Thank you very much for looking 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.880
 again and I love to see you very much 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:46.880
 fast bye
