 armors their skins and their slots 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.740
 It also tells us about it until the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.720
 maximum defense that each piece arrives 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.480
 and to release you I bring two of the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.640
 armor that taught us in the play 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 this is the one with the vanquish armor 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 the big joe 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.430
 the belt that pimp 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.550
 this armor will have 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.120
 of defense 116 that the piece minus the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 fascia the fascia curiously apart from 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.150
 have three slots goes up to 134 or 136 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.150
 defense 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.500
 well here we see the slots in the helmet 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.770
 It has two grooves in the chest 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770
 groove 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.359
 in the arms two slots 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.510
 we give him 5 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.740
 in the strip three slots if you notice no 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.420
 it affects the dragon apart from the straw 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.780
 throne if you will have minus four for the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.300
 dragon and will have a superior defense to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.300
 rest of armor parts 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.310
 and feet two slots which will make a total 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.310
 of 10 slots 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.409
 you can do little things you can sell 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.670
 two skills perfectly if 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.300
 you need a weapon with slots and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.890
 talisman with slots 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.890
 even three wave skills 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.360
 well now let's see the skills 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.340
 and what it indicates that they do here we see 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.340
 to consume to increase the speed 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 to skills that affect speed 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.510
 of consumption of meat and other objects that 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.060
 eat let's say that when you take a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.150
 potion 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.709
 the super fast take 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.349
 to see do not waste as much time as usual 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.720
 lose skill that reduces fury that 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.610
 reduces the likelihood of fainting and 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.700
 increases attack and defense a lot 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.700
 when your health is low of a certain level 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.830
 one that raises a level of edge to the weapon and 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.220
 sharp that this will not be rhombus edge that 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.560
 It is the negative ability 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.560
 that will have to be removed logically 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.450

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.620
