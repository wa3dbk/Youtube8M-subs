ibanez wd7 wah pedal and the ibanez
digital<00:00:24.779> delay<00:00:24.990> sound<00:00:25.350> tank<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.859> actually<00:00:26.099> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
digital delay sound tank it's actually a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040 
digital delay sound tank it's actually a
pretty<00:00:26.340> lil<00:00:26.519> unit<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:26.910> whatever<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
pretty lil unit for whatever and a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.600 
pretty lil unit for whatever and a
bearing<00:00:28.590> ER<00:00:28.740> v<00:00:29.400> amp<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:30.179> not<00:00:30.810> three<00:00:30.840> whatever

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so basically a multi effects unit delay

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.760 
so basically a multi effects unit delay
wah<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> chorus<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.719> yes<00:00:36.960> you're<00:00:37.200> attached

peavey<00:01:46.530> bandit<00:01:46.920> 112<00:01:47.509> was<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> only<00:01:48.750> thing

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
peavey bandit 112 was the only thing

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.609 
peavey bandit 112 was the only thing
that<00:01:49.080> has<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.939> eq<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:52.110> normal

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that has going is a little eq the normal

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.830 
that has going is a little eq the normal
stand<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.689> bit<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
stand that it has and a little bit of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.930 
stand that it has and a little bit of
reverb<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> by<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.069> little<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.459> i<00:01:56.490> mean<00:01:56.640> oh

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
reverb and by a little bit i mean oh

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.320 
reverb and by a little bit i mean oh
yeah<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.580> not<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.090> whole

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
yeah so it's not really like a whole

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.779 
yeah so it's not really like a whole
heck<00:02:00.539> of<00:02:00.569> a<00:02:00.750> lot<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.289> there<00:02:01.440> definitely

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
heck of a lot but it's there definitely

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.969 
heck of a lot but it's there definitely
so<00:02:02.789> first<00:02:03.630> thing<00:02:03.810> we'll<00:02:03.959> do<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.259> throw<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so first thing we'll do is throw a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.880 
so first thing we'll do is throw a
little<00:02:05.190> bit<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.369> chorus<00:02:05.869> okay<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.799> just

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
little bit of chorus okay so that's just

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.600 
little bit of chorus okay so that's just
the<00:02:08.250> Justice<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> f7<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.019> dx7<00:02:10.440> oh<00:02:10.769> my<00:02:11.430> god

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the Justice the f7 and the dx7 oh my god

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:22.750 
the Justice the f7 and the dx7 oh my god
all<00:02:11.850> sevens

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.730 

all<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:23.910> let's<00:02:24.120> change<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.510> depth<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
all right let's change the depth just to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.320 
all right let's change the depth just to
eat<00:02:25.950> add<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:27.990> bit<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.380> deeper

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
eat add so it's a little bit in deeper

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:45.580 
eat add so it's a little bit in deeper
obviously

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.780 

oh<00:02:46.300> cool<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:48.830> course<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.280> hear<00:02:49.489> their<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
oh cool of course you can hear their the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.570 
oh cool of course you can hear their the
luscious<00:02:50.300> reverb<00:02:50.870> as<00:02:51.110> well<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:52.400> course

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
luscious reverb as well and of course

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.720 
luscious reverb as well and of course
the<00:02:52.730> other<00:02:52.910> hammer<00:02:53.150> noise<00:02:53.360> bad<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> next<00:02:55.489> I

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the other hammer noise bad so next I

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.100 
the other hammer noise bad so next I
think<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.060> will<00:02:56.150> be<00:02:56.209> appropriate<00:02:56.540> throw<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
think it will be appropriate throw in a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.570 
think it will be appropriate throw in a
little<00:02:57.230> delay<00:02:57.940> alright<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.930> delay<00:03:00.470> its<00:03:00.830> well

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
little delay alright so delay its well

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.170 
little delay alright so delay its well
pretty<00:03:02.180> much<00:03:02.299> hear<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.629> oh<00:03:04.000> that's<00:03:05.000> pretty

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
pretty much hear it oh that's pretty

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.900 
pretty much hear it oh that's pretty
much<00:03:05.330> all<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.680> let's<00:03:07.220> play<00:03:07.400> around<00:03:07.670> with

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
much all this so let's play around with

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:24.290 
much all this so let's play around with
that<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.060> little<00:03:08.209> bit

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.160 

I<00:03:25.970> like<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.150> actually<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.110> lot

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
I like that actually I like that a lot

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.040 
I like that actually I like that a lot
now<00:03:28.980> I'm<00:03:29.280> something<00:03:30.120> you've<00:03:30.510> probably<00:03:30.840> heard

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
now I'm something you've probably heard

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.830 
now I'm something you've probably heard
several<00:03:31.290> times<00:03:31.590> with<00:03:31.920> electric<00:03:32.580> pianos<00:03:32.970> maybe

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
several times with electric pianos maybe

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.680 
several times with electric pianos maybe
not<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.290> much<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.590> exact<00:03:34.980> one<00:03:35.100> foot<00:03:35.460> more

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
not so much this exact one foot more

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.770 
not so much this exact one foot more
vintagy<00:03:36.690> analog<00:03:37.350> ones<00:03:37.620> stay<00:03:38.160> like<00:03:38.370> korg's<00:03:38.820> sp1

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
vintagy analog ones stay like korg's sp1

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.610 
vintagy analog ones stay like korg's sp1
which<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.800> realize<00:03:41.040> that's<00:03:41.130> new<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:41.520> whatever

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
which I realize that's new but whatever

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.140 
which I realize that's new but whatever
often<00:03:43.620> times<00:03:43.860> they<00:03:44.100> would<00:03:44.280> attach<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.910> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
often times they would attach that to a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.290 
often times they would attach that to a
Leslie<00:03:45.810> or<00:03:46.050> rotary<00:03:46.650> speaker<00:03:47.090> pretty<00:03:48.090> much<00:03:48.180> how

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
Leslie or rotary speaker pretty much how

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.750 
Leslie or rotary speaker pretty much how
that<00:03:48.420> does<00:03:48.630> instead<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.500> know<00:03:49.530> Oh<00:03:49.860> exactly

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
that does instead you know Oh exactly

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.710 
that does instead you know Oh exactly
what<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:50.970> sounds<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.630> because

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
what it sounds like you just because

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.400 
what it sounds like you just because
rotates<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.970> actually<00:03:54.240> have<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.750> as<00:03:54.960> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
rotates so I actually have that as a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.220 
rotates so I actually have that as a
footswitch<00:03:55.860> thing<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.490> my<00:03:56.870> fixing<00:03:57.870> unit<00:03:57.990> over

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
footswitch thing on my fixing unit over

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.810 
footswitch thing on my fixing unit over
there<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.650> now<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.220> has<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> little<00:03:59.610> bit<00:03:59.730> of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
there so now it has a little bit of

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.400 
there so now it has a little bit of
rubbery<00:04:00.090> effect<00:04:00.390> along<00:04:00.690> with<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.020> delay

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
rubbery effect along with the delay

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:19.150 
rubbery effect along with the delay
chorus

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.850 

cool<00:04:20.390> now<00:04:21.390> that's<00:04:21.720> all<00:04:21.989> well<00:04:22.260> good<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.680> as<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
cool now that's all well good and as you

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.380 
cool now that's all well good and as you
can<00:04:23.010> hear<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.370> other<00:04:23.460> rotary<00:04:23.820> effect<00:04:24.120> also

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
can hear the other rotary effect also

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.600 
can hear the other rotary effect also
adds<00:04:24.720> just<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.080> little<00:04:25.680> bit<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.920> fuzz<00:04:26.100> which<00:04:26.460> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
adds just a little bit of fuzz which is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.510 
adds just a little bit of fuzz which is
nice<00:04:27.560> should<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.680> want<00:04:28.890> more<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.130> do<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.460> an

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
nice should we want more I do have an

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.100 
nice should we want more I do have an
overdrive<00:04:29.850> pedal<00:04:30.090> over<00:04:30.120> here<00:04:30.390> which<00:04:30.780> we<00:04:31.020> could

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
overdrive pedal over here which we could

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.980 
overdrive pedal over here which we could
turn<00:04:31.500> on<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.980> be<00:04:32.160> like<00:04:35.600> it's<00:04:36.600> all<00:04:36.750> too<00:04:36.960> much

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
turn on and be like it's all too much

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.760 
turn on and be like it's all too much
this<00:04:37.410> world<00:04:37.620> turn<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:37.980> off<00:04:38.040> for<00:04:38.280> now<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.770> now

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
this world turn that off for now and now

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.140 
this world turn that off for now and now
we'll<00:04:40.980> move<00:04:41.130> on<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.640> out<00:04:41.760> of<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:41.970> wah

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
we'll move on to the out of the wah

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.410 
we'll move on to the out of the wah
pedal<00:04:42.650> that's<00:04:43.650> from<00:04:43.890> me<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.700> make<00:04:45.000> things<00:04:45.210> a

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
pedal that's from me and make things a

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.630 
pedal that's from me and make things a
little<00:04:45.480> bit<00:04:45.630> easier<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.290> they<00:04:46.470> work<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.490> little

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
little bit easier so they work a little

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.310 
little bit easier so they work a little
better<00:04:47.820> here<00:04:48.360> we<00:04:48.450> go<00:04:48.540> so<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:48.780> can<00:04:48.810> sort<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.140> see

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
better here we go so you can sort of see

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.540 
better here we go so you can sort of see
what<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:49.500> doing<00:04:49.650> my<00:04:49.770> foot<00:04:50.130> there<00:04:50.160> anyway

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
what I'm doing my foot there anyway

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.550 
what I'm doing my foot there anyway
since<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.420> can't<00:04:51.600> really<00:04:51.690> see<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.080> keyboard

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
since you can't really see the keyboard

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.400 
since you can't really see the keyboard
very<00:04:52.740> well<00:04:52.890> from<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.160> exact<00:04:53.430> position<00:04:53.520> and

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
very well from the exact position and

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.360 
very well from the exact position and
and<00:04:55.700> well<00:04:56.700> here<00:04:57.000> we<00:04:57.090> go<00:04:57.290> so<00:04:58.290> we<00:04:58.560> just<00:04:58.740> applied

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
and well here we go so we just applied

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.150 
and well here we go so we just applied
the<00:04:59.670> the<00:05:00.210> wall<00:05:00.420> now<00:05:00.840> let's<00:05:01.170> just<00:05:01.320> isolate<00:05:02.040> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
the the wall now let's just isolate the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:15.290 
the the wall now let's just isolate the
wall<00:05:02.340> ok<00:05:03.440> just<00:05:04.440> like<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:13.940> all<00:05:14.940> right<00:05:15.120> so

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
wall ok just like that all right so

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.570 
wall ok just like that all right so
that's<00:05:15.360> pretty<00:05:15.570> much<00:05:15.660> half<00:05:15.900> one<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:17.160> click

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
that's pretty much half one so click

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.300 
that's pretty much half one so click
back<00:05:17.790> on<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> rotary<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.980> just<00:05:19.980> see<00:05:20.130> what

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
back on the rotary and just see what

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:50.129 
back on the rotary and just see what
that's<00:05:20.430> like

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.430 

sweet<00:05:51.639> so<00:05:52.639> that's<00:05:53.270> just<00:05:53.449> pretty<00:05:53.750> much<00:05:54.020> with<00:05:54.289> it

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
sweet so that's just pretty much with it

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.249 
sweet so that's just pretty much with it
you<00:05:54.740> know<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.340> highest<00:05:55.610> position<00:05:56.259> let's

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
you know in the highest position let's

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.810 
you know in the highest position let's
throw<00:05:57.440> in<00:05:57.530> a<00:05:57.560> little<00:05:57.650> bit<00:05:57.830> of<00:05:57.919> course<00:05:58.160> just<00:05:58.669> so

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
throw in a little bit of course just so

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.730 
throw in a little bit of course just so
it's<00:05:59.000> nice<00:05:59.330> and<00:05:59.360> sparkly<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.169> a<00:06:00.289> little<00:06:00.470> delay

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
it's nice and sparkly and a little delay

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.060 
it's nice and sparkly and a little delay
so<00:06:00.800> we<00:06:01.250> have<00:06:01.370> a<00:06:01.400> little<00:06:01.580> extra<00:06:02.500> field<00:06:03.500> I<00:06:03.800> guess

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
so we have a little extra field I guess

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.760 
so we have a little extra field I guess
if<00:06:04.220> you<00:06:04.340> will<00:06:05.020> field<00:06:06.020> by<00:06:06.349> the<00:06:06.380> way<00:06:06.560> if<00:06:06.620> you

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
if you will field by the way if you

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.950 
if you will field by the way if you
don't<00:06:06.919> know<00:06:07.070> is<00:06:07.340> sort<00:06:07.880> of<00:06:07.910> like<00:06:08.060> general

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
don't know is sort of like general

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.610 
don't know is sort of like general
expanse<00:06:09.680> of<00:06:09.979> sound<00:06:11.289> similar<00:06:12.289> to<00:06:13.090> actually

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
expanse of sound similar to actually

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.430 
expanse of sound similar to actually
would<00:06:15.620> be<00:06:15.650> some<00:06:15.830> more<00:06:15.949> too<00:06:16.099> I<00:06:17.229> guess<00:06:18.229> like

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
would be some more too I guess like

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.150 
would be some more too I guess like

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
spatial tennis stuff except amano so i

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.279 
spatial tennis stuff except amano so i
