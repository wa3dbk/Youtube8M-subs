year<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.410> engine<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.400> seeing<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> lot

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
year for one engine we're seeing a lot

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.029 
year for one engine we're seeing a lot
of<00:00:20.910> pull<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> marketplace<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.740> fuel

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
of pull from the marketplace and as fuel

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.060 
of pull from the marketplace and as fuel
goes<00:00:23.369> over<00:00:23.640> $125<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> barrel<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.769> really

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
goes over $125 a barrel it's really

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.800 
goes over $125 a barrel it's really
getting<00:00:26.250> important<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.029> airlines<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> look

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
getting important for airlines to look

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.500 
getting important for airlines to look
at<00:00:27.960> ways<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> save<00:00:28.650> fuel<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.730> equal<00:00:30.029> power<00:00:30.210> we

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
at ways to save fuel with equal power we

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.080 
at ways to save fuel with equal power we
can<00:00:30.689> wash<00:00:31.170> any<00:00:31.619> type<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> turbomachinery<00:00:32.489> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
can wash any type of turbomachinery so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
can wash any type of turbomachinery so
we<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.719> watch<00:00:33.930> any<00:00:34.230> engine<00:00:34.649> type<00:00:34.890> any

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
we can watch any engine type any

across all om platform we've designed it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
across all om platform we've designed it
to<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> closed-loop<00:00:41.100> system<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to be a closed-loop system so they can

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.779 
to be a closed-loop system so they can
be<00:00:42.930> performed<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> gate<00:00:44.399> you

be performed right here at the gate you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.340 
be performed right here at the gate you
don't<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> move<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.450> aircraft<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.200> can

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
don't have to move your aircraft you can

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.229 
don't have to move your aircraft you can
watch<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.890> wherever<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.579> park<00:00:48.090> your

watch that wherever you park your
aircraft<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> night<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.770> closed

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
aircraft for the night it's a closed

loop system that captures all of the
waste<00:00:53.190> products<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.570> recycle<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
waste products we can recycle them and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
waste products we can recycle them and
reuse<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> water<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.520> over<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.910> over<00:00:56.969> again

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
reuse the water and over and over again

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.590 
reuse the water and over and over again
we're<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> US<00:00:59.100> Europe<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.059> also

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we're actually in the US Europe and also

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
we're actually in the US Europe and also
in<00:01:00.899> Asia<00:01:01.079> right<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.879> have

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
in Asia right now so we have we have

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
in Asia right now so we have we have
covered<00:01:03.300> pretty<00:01:03.480> broad<00:01:03.719> coverage<00:01:04.170> throughout

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
covered pretty broad coverage throughout

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
covered pretty broad coverage throughout
our<00:01:04.680> network<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.640> designed<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> system

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
our network where we designed the system

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
our network where we designed the system
to<00:01:06.600> use<00:01:06.780> only<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.560> pure<00:01:07.860> water<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.460> clean<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to use only very pure water to clean the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
to use only very pure water to clean the
engines<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.780> atomizes<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> water<00:01:10.890> droplets

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
engines it atomizes the water droplets

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.789 
engines it atomizes the water droplets
delivers<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.180> effectively<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> core

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
delivers them effectively into the core

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
delivers them effectively into the core
of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> engine<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> cleans<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> whole<00:01:15.240> gas

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of the engine so it cleans the whole gas

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.170 
of the engine so it cleans the whole gas
stop<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.650> by<00:01:17.009> using<00:01:17.220> pure<00:01:17.640> water<00:01:17.909> we're

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
stop so by using pure water we're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
stop so by using pure water we're
getting<00:01:18.479> excellent<00:01:18.990> benefit<00:01:19.439> excellent

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
getting excellent benefit excellent

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.230 
getting excellent benefit excellent
recovery<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.520> performance<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> engine

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
recovery of performance of the engine

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
recovery of performance of the engine
and<00:01:21.720> also<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.920> recover<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> water

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and also we can then recover the water

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
and also we can then recover the water
filter<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.930> reuse<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.439> water<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.369> you're

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
filter it and reuse the water so you're

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.109 
filter it and reuse the water so you're
not<00:01:26.850> putting<00:01:27.210> those<00:01:27.659> harsh<00:01:28.290> chemicals<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:29.130> the

you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.590> capture<00:01:31.829> them<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> protect<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you can capture them and protect the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can capture them and protect the
