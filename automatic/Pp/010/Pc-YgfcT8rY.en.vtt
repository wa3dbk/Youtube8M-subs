00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.539 
of you asked me if I could talk about
the<00:01:24.270> eye<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> genre<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.590> unfortunately

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the eye of a genre but unfortunately

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
the eye of a genre but unfortunately
there<00:01:26.790> isn't<00:01:26.939> much<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.110> guess

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
there isn't much to go on I would guess

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
there isn't much to go on I would guess
that<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> new<00:01:28.920> hearthstone<00:01:29.579> expansion

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that it's a new hearthstone expansion

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
that it's a new hearthstone expansion
but<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> close<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> warcraft<00:01:31.079> 4<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.650> could

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but a close to be a warcraft 4 it could

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
but a close to be a warcraft 4 it could
also<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> while<00:01:32.460> expansion<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.210> mean<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
also be a while expansion I mean it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
also be a while expansion I mean it
seems<00:01:33.900> unlikely<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.860> haven't<00:01:35.250> even

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
seems unlikely right we haven't even

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
seems unlikely right we haven't even
received<00:01:35.790> word<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.360> yet<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> now

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
received word so that I know yet and now

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.120 
received word so that I know yet and now
already<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.710> new<00:01:37.920> wow<00:01:38.100> expansion

already going to get a new wow expansion

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880 
already going to get a new wow expansion
but<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.210> impossible<00:01:39.530> let's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.619> wait

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but it's not impossible let's just wait

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.109 
but it's not impossible let's just wait

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
on the stream but it kinda depends on

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.940 
on the stream but it kinda depends on
how<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> launch<00:02:00.540> goes<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.320> miss<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> Pandaria

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.450 
i also did a play on a getting realm
first<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.990> i<00:02:04.020> got<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.259> accidents<00:02:04.710> this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
first and i got about accidents this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.459 
first and i got about accidents this
time<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.880> actually<00:02:06.060> remove<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.869> achievements

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so there is a much reason to go and see

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.300
