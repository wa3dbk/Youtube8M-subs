00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
to add them into the cucumber bowl and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.930 
to add them into the cucumber bowl and
mix<00:03:41.750> them<00:03:41.930> all<00:03:41.989> together<00:03:42.549> this<00:03:43.549> bowl<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:43.910> a

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
mix them all together this bowl is a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.310 
mix them all together this bowl is a
tight<00:03:44.180> squeeze<00:03:44.209> but<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.840> just<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.110> perfect

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
tight squeeze but it's just the perfect

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.170 
tight squeeze but it's just the perfect
size<00:03:45.470> for<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.860> salad<00:03:46.310> too<00:03:47.350> I'd<00:03:48.350> rather<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.739> a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
size for the salad too I'd rather have a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.229 
size for the salad too I'd rather have a
little<00:03:50.180> bit<00:03:50.360> tight<00:03:51.110> than<00:03:51.380> too<00:03:51.680> much<00:03:51.709> room<00:03:52.239> what

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
little bit tight than too much room what

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.310 
little bit tight than too much room what
that<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.420> don't<00:03:53.540> even<00:03:53.720> know<00:03:53.900> if<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.110> makes

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
that I don't even know if that makes

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.560 
that I don't even know if that makes
sense<00:03:54.410> but<00:03:54.709> I'll<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.790> back<00:03:55.970> when<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.239> get<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.480> all

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
sense but I'll be back when I get it all

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.910 
sense but I'll be back when I get it all
in<00:03:56.720> all<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.170> veggies<00:03:57.320> are<00:03:57.500> in<00:03:57.650> there<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
in all the veggies are in there and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.900 
in all the veggies are in there and
you're<00:03:58.040> really<00:03:58.250> gonna<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.670> get<00:03:58.790> your

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
you're really gonna have to get your

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.220 
you're really gonna have to get your
hands<00:03:59.090> in<00:03:59.239> there<00:03:59.360> mix<00:03:59.630> them<00:03:59.750> together<00:03:59.840> that's

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
hands in there mix them together that's

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.930 
hands in there mix them together that's
just<00:04:00.320> probably<00:04:00.830> pretty<00:04:01.160> much<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.519> only<00:04:01.549> way

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
just probably pretty much the only way

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.500 
just probably pretty much the only way
you<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.299> do<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.920> so<00:04:03.920> now<00:04:04.280> it's<00:04:04.549> on<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:05.180> this

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
you can do it so now it's on to this

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.630 
you can do it so now it's on to this
