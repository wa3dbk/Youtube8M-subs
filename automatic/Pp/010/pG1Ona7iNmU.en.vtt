00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 so the climax that we are on a word n 1 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.820
 100% - air hockey bauer what's the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 better quality of hair that exists 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.790
 today 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.920
 the advantage is that good quality 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.929
 of bad is well worth a mixed 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 terms of sustainability and that we gain in 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.010
 glide quality so that's going to be 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920
 skins that are going to be very powerful 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.439
 on the rise to note also so the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 new system task systems our 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 tasks before that will adapt to all 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 the spatulas agree and that will also 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.010
 allow for power without lifting in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.540
 keeping the skis so if you are in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.550
 positions a little tricky which you 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.829
 are in the menu points quickly 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.860
 system trolls very easy and the system 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 back which is tunable ok who 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.570
 just got caught on on a party at 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.170
 heel of the one there too very easy to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.539
 put and a joker progeco the first 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.079
 break without collar or in fact the company 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.230
 sport before place and therefore the glue by 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.170
 by silicone the silicone does not commit 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.659
 bad of inconvenience 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.460
 winter glue including 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 time extreme temperatures like 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 as we can find some times in 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 winter since the silicone the advantage 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.530
 it begins to freeze from month 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.610
 these are 10 degrees and use in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.740
 temperature the hot scenes 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 we start to have defects of 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 silicone but from over 90 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.900
 the advantage of silicone so it is that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.980
 it's a very washable material 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.410
 easily two possibilities of 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.460
 to maintain your pots he is washed the 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.870
 first loop went to water 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.000
 clear by rubbing them a little bit for 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.030
 remove the impurities the second the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.700
 30 degree machine patients for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.590
 could rise he had the silicone 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.300
 and reactivate the principle 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.980
 that's the little over 2.7 in 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.140
 also its ease of use 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.630
 especially for women since 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.580
 in fact the silicone school that is to say 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.080
 much less than the glue is so 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.940
 very easy to open very easy to do 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 but we do not even have to 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.700
 put a plastic film on it or 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.780
 to keep it here you can 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.680
 prove the ball row in the bag 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.930
 and december 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.420
 the silicone will always work and 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.170
 so the skin exists in 5 widths 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.910
 different agree 100 110 120 130 140 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.590
 there are also skins for speed 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 board and eon 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.970
 this year we release a specific skin 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.970
 race so that goes from 59 mm to 100 mm
