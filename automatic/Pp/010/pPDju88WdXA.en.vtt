00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.690 
will be problems if I try and go for
something<00:03:42.440> which<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:42.920> shouldn't<00:03:43.190> go<00:03:43.430> for

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
something which I shouldn't go for

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.170 
something which I shouldn't go for
because<00:03:43.970> I'm<00:03:44.090> not<00:03:44.239> doing<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.599> 100<00:03:45.049> playthrough

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
because I'm not doing a 100 playthrough

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.750 
because I'm not doing a 100 playthrough

then I will encounter problems but only

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.110 
then I will encounter problems but only
then<00:03:53.709> if<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.950> was<00:03:55.190> doing<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.519> playthrough<00:03:55.880> for

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
this is one of those sections where you

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.850 
this is one of those sections where you
literally<00:06:00.130> can't<00:06:00.820> choose<00:06:01.270> when<00:06:01.630> you<00:06:01.660> go<00:06:01.990> like

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
literally can't choose when you go like

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.770 
literally can't choose when you go like
it's<00:06:03.100> not<00:06:03.310> even<00:06:03.370> like<00:06:03.730> you<00:06:03.970> can't<00:06:04.210> i'm<00:06:04.510> the

it's not even like you can't i'm the
first<00:06:05.020> one<00:06:05.200> because<00:06:05.560> whenever<00:06:05.950> you<00:06:06.250> jump<00:06:06.580> for

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
first one because whenever you jump for

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.400 
first one because whenever you jump for
the<00:06:06.820> first<00:06:07.060> one<00:06:07.360> then<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.600> rest<00:06:07.960> have<00:06:08.260> to

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
the first one then the rest have to

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.500 
the first one then the rest have to
follow<00:06:08.620> suit<00:06:08.980> and<00:06:09.250> there's<00:06:09.820> no<00:06:10.060> way<00:06:10.270> you<00:06:10.330> can

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
follow suit and there's no way you can

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.860 
follow suit and there's no way you can
predict<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.020> timing<00:06:11.290> for<00:06:11.470> all<00:06:11.680> of<00:06:11.860> them

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
predict the timing for all of them

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.730 
predict the timing for all of them
especially<00:06:13.870> if<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.170> don't<00:06:14.230> know<00:06:14.380> it's<00:06:14.530> coming

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
especially if you don't know it's coming

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.130 
especially if you don't know it's coming
