00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.110
 such colleagues as they are then I 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.630
 again they do a tutorial for 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.580
 you to remind them that for 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.350
 this continue I need you to support 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.030
 sharing this video with all the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.400
 people who can so that you have many 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.880
 like many visits here on this channel 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 from YouTube 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.290
 and the concept of messages according to 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.290
 wikipedia 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.760
 whereby a part of moves 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.920
 body in different ways with a 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 sell a bandage has three different 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.240
 objectives the first is to conserve 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.030
 body temperature of our 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.180
 patient so we will prevent the heat from 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.760
 lose the second is the compression in 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.890
 that we are going to avoid venous stasis the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.650
 formation of thrombi or clots in 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.410
 the third veins is the immobilization 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.960
 that's when there are fractures in 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.060
 the body and through a bandage we are going to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.070
 secure them so they do not move or 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.260
 so they are aligned 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.870
 for the first bandage to show goes to 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.940
 We are going to do the circular bandage 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.220
 in this leg that has just been amputated 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.010
 of a patient in the operating room before 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.500
 they bury him we are going to occupy it 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 like all bandages have to start with 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.300
 two initial turns 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 to ensure that he is not going to move 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.200
 as its name says it let's go 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.470
 just making circles towards 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.470
 above 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 to reach the distal third of 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.920
 again we are going to do two laps 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.920
 end to finish 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.990
 the next bandage to prove is the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.000
 bandage called the spike 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.260
 let's start again with two 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 circular turns 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.050
 in this is going to be a slim turn 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.050
 upwards 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.610
 as well as circular 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.690
 the purpose of this bandage 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.620
 and we can see it 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.400
 another type of advantage is the bandage 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.520
 called in 8 s is normally used in 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.560
 the joints to make a light 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.560
 compression and fixation 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.769
 they are precisely called 8 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.769
 that we are going to draw is in that number 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.120
 is going to be the compression directly in 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.120
 the joint 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.140
 leave it free heel this is usually 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.740
 make 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.740
 in ankles 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.810
 another bandage that I'm going to demonstrate in this 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.819
 occasion is going to be the abdominal bandage 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.340
 I'm going to use a vein of 30 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:46.069
 centimeters we are going to extend it by 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.069
 complete and we are going to do 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.360
 the letter m liu xia 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.120
 this is going to divide our sale into 3 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.230
 unequal 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.690
 the goal of having the sale of this 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.870
 how is that going to put us 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.010
 well below our patient 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.769
 we are going to 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.650
 put this bundle as if it were the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.060
 our patient's abdomen this bandage 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.350
 it must be done with the help of two 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.830
 One person will be 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.250
 in this extreme and the other here is going to 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.930
 start the person on this side is going to 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.080
 pass the bandage on the patient 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.350
 doing the desired compression while 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.350
 what 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.560
 the person on the other side the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.490
 nurse nurse from the other side goes to 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.880
 be the same 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.240
 he comes back again and a third time 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.480
 this is going to stay there subject and going to 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.000
 be our bandage 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.120
 abdominal 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.670
 is usually used in the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.670
 postpartum patients either needed or 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.639
 of labor when it is necessary to have 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.340
 a certain support 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.439
 not as such so that life does not open 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.689
 it is very difficult for a wound to open to 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.449
 unless it is infected is rather 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:18.939
 to give security to the patient and 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.340
 well in the case of the physiological puerperium and 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:24.520
 surgical is also for that skin 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.889
 that was tense during pregnancy that 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.370
 return to its original form and then 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.630
 they are left with a wasp-like waist 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.010
 or model 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.250
 come on is something we had not done 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.740
 let's do the things that never ever 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.100
 should a nurse say 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.510
 nurse 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.150
 is that they did not teach me in the 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.600
 school for me there is a disadvantage if 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.060
 something arrives 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.230
 the metal that I 'm not drunk so I can 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.210
 to work 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.360
 but nothing we put to the part of what 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.040
 is the surgery do not worry lady what 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.660
 What happens is that they do not let any 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.850
 Once at the hospital, I think that's why 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.090
 come self husband to see you equal 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.280
 channels and kaka later I achieve run 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.060
 the children I do not think there's no say 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.490
 medicine 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.260
 and apart from the husband he has animals in 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.260
 house even there I'll give you 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.529
 without this order 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.449
 those with the penalty 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:29.249
 It is not my fight as you want 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.249
 do not worry they will not read 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:42.650
 but he did not tell me it was alierta 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.169
 little is diluted 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:52.060
 but it's the engagement ring almost no 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:52.060
 you see it's not working like that 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.650
 and my patients ended up with a lot of music 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.969
 here the baking tutorial 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.449
 I liked it 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:08.999
 share the like to pass it on to your friends 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.300
 known so that those who do then 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:13.520
 a bigger project true 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.780
 that happy national holidays for 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.780
 you share everything until later 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:24.909
 they told me look at attention that his vision 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:30.610
 humanist was always in prison 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:37.319
 'god pythons to the communities of the 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:37.319
 nation covered we understand lies
