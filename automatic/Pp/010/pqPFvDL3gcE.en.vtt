00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.980
 in short there are 5 kafka then I like about 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:14.099
 we are 7 but under the action they are like 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 I donâ€™t know too much, no shorter 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.930
 do the same thing here they have a scheme 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 on which everyone play go trips i don't 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.070
 stick to that and take the type 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.900
 the same characters almost always 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 that is, there are heroes who play 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.730
 a hero who don't play there and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.559
 jagernaut in speke and so on go 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.329
 all play equally with these axami jagger 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.489
 on lati roughly similar builds 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 do doing the same actions then 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 there they farm when you need to buy there 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 dagger go there something gango somewhere 40 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.780
 then again farmer take roshan go 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 pushes everything and they are very passive very 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 caution acts run to St. Petersburg 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.620
 you farm the woods in five when no one 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.890
 not visible on the map of the type that is, they play 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 each one to play the kind of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.609
 competently 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.460
 although often thoughtlessly but competently 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.159
 it seems that there is no 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.010
 there you will not see any creativity 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.799
 well type yes there each game as a cover yes 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.720
 and afraid to come up with something well and in short 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.640
 there was at first it was fun and interesting 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.820
 then on some fifth day there 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.710
 I'm really sick of it because 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.330
 you take that answer to you right there you 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.330
 you take some tinker yourself right off 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.090
 More type of moron where the effect of even such 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.060
 style you like yesterday salute immediately 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.670
 silencer in them support ppd really take 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 him and he is very duty answer that not type in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.860
 the pub 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.290
 I perceived by the fact that they do not know 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.990
 google any attack ally global 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.329
 any safe is needed global that is and not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.070
 need to say anything to write with us is 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.020
 feel unut just repulsed by some 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 chains run around not even double they 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 give that is if you take the waste about 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 global you can forget it there 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.909
 feeling stagger like this is the most fierce 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.250
 a cafe when you run around like that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.250
 some kind of site something like this
