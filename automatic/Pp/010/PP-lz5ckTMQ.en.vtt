this imac not the original and it's the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.120 
this imac not the original and it's the
2001<00:00:20.010> indigo<00:00:20.880> version<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.130> 500

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
2001 indigo version with the 500

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
2001 indigo version with the 500
megahertz<00:00:23.430> g3<00:00:24.080> processor<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:26.000> 256<00:00:27.000> megabytes

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
megahertz g3 processor and 256 megabytes

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.060 
megahertz g3 processor and 256 megabytes
of<00:00:28.320> ram<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.849> 60<00:00:29.849> gigabyte<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.539> dry<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.740> let's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of ram and 60 gigabyte are dry so let's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:51.170 
of ram and 60 gigabyte are dry so let's
pull<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.340> up

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.180 

so<00:00:51.900> there's<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.470> finder<00:00:53.010> icon<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.800> apple

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so there's the finder icon and the apple

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.380 
so there's the finder icon and the apple
logo<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.580> screen<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.610> not<00:00:59.730> flickering

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
logo and the screen is not flickering

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.430 
logo and the screen is not flickering
again<00:01:01.790> it's<00:01:02.790> just<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.330> video<00:01:03.600> because

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
again it's just on the video because

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.420 
again it's just on the video because
it's<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.860> old<00:01:05.400> screen<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.720> pretty<00:01:06.990> nice

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
it's an old screen but it's pretty nice

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
it's an old screen but it's pretty nice
high<00:01:08.430> resolution

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.560 

spooning<00:01:19.770> every<00:01:20.159> prayer<00:01:20.729> fast<00:01:21.030> texture<00:01:26.570> so

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
spooning every prayer fast texture so

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.649 
spooning every prayer fast texture so
that's<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.079> boot<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:30.200> yes<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.659> I'm

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that's the boot up I think yes and I'm

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.139 
that's the boot up I think yes and I'm
not<00:01:33.899> connected<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.710> Internet<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
not connected to the Internet I just

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.840 
not connected to the Internet I just
discovered<00:01:36.719> so<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:40.350> my<00:01:40.740> next<00:01:40.950> year<00:01:41.280> will<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
discovered so in my next year will be

00:01:41.850 --> 00:02:07.780 
discovered so in my next year will be
that<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.479> yes<00:01:43.469> and<00:01:44.899> let's<00:01:45.899> click<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:53.450> find<00:01:54.450> her

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.820 

and<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.960> version<00:02:12.250> 10.4<00:02:13.250> point<00:02:13.550> 11<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.830> 500

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and so version 10.4 point 11 and 500

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.990 
and so version 10.4 point 11 and 500
megahertz<00:02:16.150> powerpc<00:02:17.150> g3<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:18.460> 256<00:02:19.460> megabytes

megahertz powerpc g3 and 256 megabytes
of<00:02:20.360> RAM<00:02:20.860> I'm<00:02:21.860> looking<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.580> internet<00:02:23.060> how

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
of RAM I'm looking on the internet how

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.930 
of RAM I'm looking on the internet how
to<00:02:24.380> upgrade<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.580> RAM<00:02:25.790> up<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.990> because<00:02:27.500> I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
to upgrade the RAM up this because I

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.720 
to upgrade the RAM up this because I
took<00:02:28.940> ram<00:02:29.270> for<00:02:29.540> my<00:02:29.690> OPC<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.650> put<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.520> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
took ram for my OPC and put it in the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.340 
took ram for my OPC and put it in the
imac<00:02:32.360> but<00:02:32.840> that's<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.520> when<00:02:34.520> i<00:02:34.550> boot<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.090> up

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
imac but that's not when i boot it up

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.310 
imac but that's not when i boot it up
when<00:02:36.350> i<00:02:36.380> put<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:36.950> him<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.840> came<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
when i put in him so it just came a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:47.080 
when i put in him so it just came a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
that back to old one and when I opened

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.670 
that back to old one and when I opened
the<00:02:58.690> thing<00:02:59.690> to<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:02.000> do<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.989> discovered

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
the thing to to do that I discovered

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
the thing to to do that I discovered
that<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:05.120> RAM<00:03:05.360> had<00:03:05.750> pulled<00:03:06.500> off<00:03:06.680> from<00:03:07.280> its<00:03:09.700> so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
that the RAM had pulled off from its so

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.370 
that the RAM had pulled off from its so
that's<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.239> good<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.890> oh<00:03:13.780> yeah<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:17.380> we

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
that's not good but oh yeah and we

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.330 
that's not good but oh yeah and we
should<00:03:18.560> look<00:03:18.709> at<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:21.380> dashboard<00:03:22.040> it's

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
should look at the dashboard it's

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.740 
should look at the dashboard it's
hacking<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> limit<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:26.030> now<00:03:26.209> I'm<00:03:26.540> not

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
hacking a limit but now I'm not

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.890 
hacking a limit but now I'm not
connected<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.620> internet<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:29.150> weather<00:03:29.390> and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
connected to internet so the weather and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.090 
connected to internet so the weather and
so<00:03:30.769> on<00:03:30.980> will<00:03:31.190> not<00:03:31.370> display<00:03:32.299> properly<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.950> is

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
so on will not display properly but is

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:58.510 
so on will not display properly but is
working<00:03:37.489> well<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:38.140> think<00:03:41.470> it's<00:03:42.470> lagging<00:03:43.070> moment

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520
