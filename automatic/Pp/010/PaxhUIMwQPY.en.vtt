00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.880 

I<00:00:35.270> feel<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.450> our<00:00:36.570> professors<00:00:37.080> try<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I feel like our professors try and be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.460 
I feel like our professors try and be
our<00:00:38.400> peers<00:00:39.150> for<00:00:39.360> us<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.840> they're<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
our peers for us and they're here to

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.900 
our peers for us and they're here to
help<00:00:40.650> us<00:00:40.830> learn<00:00:41.040> even<00:00:41.400> though<00:00:41.640> they're<00:00:41.820> gonna

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
help us learn even though they're gonna

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
help us learn even though they're gonna
make<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.240> challenging<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:42.780> hard<00:00:42.870> they<00:00:43.770> also

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
make it challenging and hard they also

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.910 
make it challenging and hard they also
want<00:00:44.310> us<00:00:44.400> to<00:00:44.730> grow<00:00:45.540> as<00:00:45.870> engineers<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.830> they

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
want us to grow as engineers and they

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350 
want us to grow as engineers and they
want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> learn<00:00:47.490> this<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.970> be<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.180> best

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
want to learn this and be the best

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.170 
want to learn this and be the best
engineers<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.290> can<00:00:49.470> be<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:51.090> I'd

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
engineers we can be the one thing I'd

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
engineers we can be the one thing I'd
like<00:00:51.270> they're<00:00:51.450> really<00:00:51.810> like<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.900> professors

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
like they're really like the professors

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.800 
like they're really like the professors
were<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.880> selling<00:00:57.240> point<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.540> me

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
were really the selling point for me

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.440 
were really the selling point for me
because<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> professors<00:00:59.010> were<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.880> nice<00:01:00.120> even

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
because the professors were so nice even

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.080 
because the professors were so nice even
on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.990> open<00:01:01.470> house<00:01:01.620> days<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.340> the

on the open house days and the
candidates<00:01:03.480> days<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.020> they<00:01:04.500> were<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:05.280> open

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
friendly and outgoing and I didn't want

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.219 
friendly and outgoing and I didn't want
a<00:01:11.160> set<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> professors<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.630> their<00:01:13.050> office

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
a set of professors where their office

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
a set of professors where their office
doors<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.770> shut<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
doors would be shut all the time and I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.430 
doors would be shut all the time and I
couldn't<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.410> to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
couldn't get to know them and get to

couldn't get to know them and get to
talk<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> them<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.760> attracted<00:01:18.119> me<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
talk to them what attracted me to

Villanova's<00:01:18.840> engineering<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.710> fact

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
Villanova's engineering was the fact

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
Villanova's engineering was the fact
that<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.340> were<00:01:20.400> ranked<00:01:20.910> tenth<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that they were ranked tenth in the

that they were ranked tenth in the
country<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.080> went<00:01:22.350> around<00:01:22.410> looked<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.800> other

country I went around looked at other
schools<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.880> couldn't<00:01:24.570> compare<00:01:24.930> with

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
schools and I couldn't compare with

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
schools and I couldn't compare with
small<00:01:26.310> class<00:01:26.580> sizes<00:01:26.880> resources<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.930> the

engineering<00:01:30.660> is<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> challenge<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
engineering is a challenge but it's a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.710 
engineering is a challenge but it's a
challenge<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.180> through<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
challenge that you go through with so

family and you learn how to depend on
each<00:01:36.660> other<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.619> much<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.100> than<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.550> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.080 

the<00:02:34.250> days<00:02:34.430> where<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.030> be

I<00:02:40.760> think<00:02:41.270> it's<00:02:41.480> important<00:02:41.930> for<00:02:42.069> engineers<00:02:43.069> to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I think it's important for engineers to

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.400 
I think it's important for engineers to
learn<00:02:44.209> about<00:02:44.480> all<00:02:44.959> different<00:02:45.290> disciplines

learn about all different disciplines

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.589 
learn about all different disciplines

really<00:03:24.769> can<00:03:24.920> say<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:25.340> I've<00:03:25.549> gained<00:03:25.970> both

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
really can say that I've gained both

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.479 
really can say that I've gained both
aspects<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.530> through<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.860> classes<00:03:28.310> and

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
aspects of that through the classes and

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.520 
aspects of that through the classes and
then<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.870> experience<00:03:29.870> here<00:03:30.230> it's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
then this experience here it's

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.820 
then this experience here it's
invaluable<00:03:31.340> really<00:03:32.260> Villanova<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.709> to

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
invaluable really Villanova we have to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.270 
invaluable really Villanova we have to
take<00:03:34.010> things<00:03:34.280> like<00:03:34.599> engineering<00:03:35.599> ethics<00:03:36.280> so

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
take things like engineering ethics so

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.550 
take things like engineering ethics so
that<00:03:37.430> teaches<00:03:37.820> us<00:03:38.030> when<00:03:38.239> we're<00:03:38.420> making<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:39.350> new

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that teaches us when we're making a new

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.009 
that teaches us when we're making a new
product<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.760> consequences<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.720> come<00:03:41.959> with
