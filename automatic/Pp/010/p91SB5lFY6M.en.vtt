00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
confident throughout we asked Timoshenko

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.340 
confident throughout we asked Timoshenko
for<00:01:24.000> his<00:01:24.119> thoughts<00:01:24.359> on<00:01:24.539> this<00:01:24.630> late<00:01:24.899> phase<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
for his thoughts on this late phase of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.719 
for his thoughts on this late phase of
the<00:01:25.439> tournament<00:01:25.890> where<00:01:26.070> many<00:01:26.250> players<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the tournament where many players have

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.849 
the tournament where many players have
built<00:01:26.939> deeper<00:01:27.270> stacks<00:01:27.570> heading<00:01:27.899> into<00:01:28.020> day<00:01:28.289> 6<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
built deeper stacks heading into day 6 I

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.069 
built deeper stacks heading into day 6 I
think<00:01:29.219> because<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.119> many<00:01:30.210> players<00:01:30.539> are<00:01:30.780> deep

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
think because so many players are deep

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.459 
think because so many players are deep
and<00:01:31.549> some<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.700> them<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.719> experienced

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
and some of them are not as experienced

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.919 
and some of them are not as experienced
there's<00:01:34.880> even<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:35.909> value<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
there's even more value in the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.429 
there's even more value in the
tournament<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.439> than<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:39.079> right<00:01:40.079> one

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
tournament now than there was right one

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
tournament now than there was right one
we<00:01:40.890> got<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.219> the<00:01:41.399> money

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we got into the money

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.710 
we got into the money
I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.990> there's<00:01:43.140> still<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
I think there's still a lot of a lot of

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
I think there's still a lot of a lot of
inexperienced<00:01:45.720> players<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.920> may<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.190> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
inexperienced players that may be a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.780 
inexperienced players that may be a
little<00:01:47.760> bit<00:01:48.290> fazed<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.130> pressure<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
little bit fazed by the pressure and the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.060 
little bit fazed by the pressure and the
amount<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.750> money<00:01:51.870> at<00:01:52.050> stake<00:01:52.080> so<00:01:52.590> there's<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
amount of money at stake so there's a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.390 
amount of money at stake so there's a
lot<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.780> opportunities<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:56.190> of<00:01:56.220> pick

first<00:02:35.160> I've<00:02:35.640> been<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.120> lot<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.330> high

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
first I've been in a lot of high

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.290 
first I've been in a lot of high
pressure<00:02:36.810> situations<00:02:37.739> flipping<00:02:38.280> coins<00:02:39.030> for

large<00:02:39.480> amounts<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.930> money<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:40.620> I'm

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
large amounts of money so I think I'm

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.380 
large amounts of money so I think I'm
pretty<00:02:41.100> desensitized<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
pretty desensitized to you know the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.199 
pretty desensitized to you know the
emotion<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.630> variance<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.940> think

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
emotion of the variance and I think

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.640 
emotion of the variance and I think
that's<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.540> work<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.840> my<00:02:48.959> advantage<00:02:48.989> you
