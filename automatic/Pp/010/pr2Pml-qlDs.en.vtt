00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 3rd price on dental implant for 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.799
 explain about price 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.759
 I need our first three questions 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.429
 the myth of inaccessibility as found 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.710
 that the total rehabilitation of marked 1 is 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.550
 the multiplication of the price of a single 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 draw 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.590
 and third, the huge number of variables 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.320
 is common in a comment or other 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.019
 saying that prices are astronomical 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.449
 but these people did not do it 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 for many years the number of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 professionals make treatment with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 dental implants has increased too 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.430
 the last few years and this has helped to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 treatment 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 Another important factor is flexibility 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.860
 payment 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.100
 another thing is to think that the rehabilitation 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.460
 total is the multiplication of the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.289
 value of an implant is a misconception 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.360
 there are techniques today that you can 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.879
 rehabilitate a house with four or six 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.739
 implants the factors that influence the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 price of an implant treatment 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 are numerous 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.460
 impossible is the salone including the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
 cost of dental implant varies greatly 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.000
 of a professional type of professional 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 infant 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 there are several brands with various prices 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 how imported implants are more 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 expensive but not always better than the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 national 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 the cost also depends on the qualification 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 professional training of each 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.520
 in which region the clinic is located 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.570
 but the main factors are the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.250
 oral health bone structure of the patient 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 and the materials used in the treatment 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 treatment with a dental implant is a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.960
 service provision is not a good 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 material it is necessary to evaluate the patient 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 My tip for you is to make more than one 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 evaluation 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.820
 you will realize that prices are not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 Equally important is to make your 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.990
 This evaluation is the first step towards 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.079
 solve your problem 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 even if you decide not to start now 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.310
 you can program to start 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.680
 therefore it is only possible to know the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.880
 exact value of your treatment by making 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.880
 evaluation with your dentist 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 I hope I have helped thank you for you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.400
 monitor and until the next
