00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
I believe if I your teammate collects

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.340 
I believe if I your teammate collects
your<00:05:06.310> tag<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:06.820> get<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.030> hundred<00:05:07.270> points<00:05:07.780> but<00:05:08.110> if

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
your tag you get a hundred points but if

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.080 
your tag you get a hundred points but if
you<00:05:08.470> collect<00:05:08.740> that<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.920> get<00:05:09.100> 150<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.820> think

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
you collect that you get 150 I think

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.800 
you collect that you get 150 I think
that's<00:05:10.240> how<00:05:10.390> it<00:05:10.420> works

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810
