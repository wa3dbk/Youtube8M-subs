00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.440 
how the system works I'm going to run
around<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.610> back<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:40.940> car<00:01:41.119> right<00:01:41.300> now

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
around the back of the car right now

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.300 
around the back of the car right now
so<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.020> can<00:01:42.110> see<00:01:42.260> what<00:01:42.410> happens<00:01:42.740> if<00:01:42.830> an<00:01:42.920> object

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so you can see what happens if an object

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.060 
so you can see what happens if an object
does<00:01:43.430> come<00:01:43.670> into<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.900> one<00:01:45.050> meter<00:01:45.229> distance<00:01:45.440> to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
does come into the one meter distance to

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.120 
does come into the one meter distance to
the<00:01:46.160> back<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.490> vehicle<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.479> here<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.170> go

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.290 

something<00:01:52.130> gets<00:01:52.310> too<00:01:52.460> close<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.970> back<00:01:53.150> of

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
something gets too close to the back of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.350 
something gets too close to the back of
the<00:01:53.390> car<00:01:53.660> like<00:01:54.500> me<00:01:54.910> you're<00:01:55.910> actually<00:01:56.150> going<00:01:56.270> to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
the car like me you're actually going to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.150 
the car like me you're actually going to
sense<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.720> as<00:01:56.900> bumping<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.530> lighting<00:01:58.040> up

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
sense it as bumping and lighting up

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
sense it as bumping and lighting up
inside<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> vehicle

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
inside the vehicle

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.060 
inside the vehicle
hopefully<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.200> lit<00:02:00.350> up<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.620> there<00:02:00.770> for<00:02:00.950> you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
hopefully that lit up on there for you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.520 
hopefully that lit up on there for you
so<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.340> can<00:02:01.580> see<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.850> if<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:03.290> any<00:02:03.409> reason

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
so that you can see it if for any reason

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.560 
so that you can see it if for any reason
you<00:02:03.950> did<00:02:04.130> not<00:02:04.310> want<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.730> use<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.330> feature

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
you did not want to use this feature

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.450 
you did not want to use this feature
while<00:02:05.960> you're<00:02:06.110> operating<00:02:06.409> your<00:02:06.500> BMW<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.190> can

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
while you're operating your BMW you can

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.820 
while you're operating your BMW you can
turn<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.060> off<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:09.260> can<00:02:09.470> happen<00:02:09.709> especially

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
turn it off this can happen especially

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.040 
turn it off this can happen especially
I've<00:02:10.610> done<00:02:10.760> this<00:02:10.850> in<00:02:11.030> my<00:02:11.060> own<00:02:11.269> driveway<00:02:11.480> if<00:02:11.900> you

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
I've done this in my own driveway if you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.110 
I've done this in my own driveway if you
have<00:02:12.200> hedges<00:02:12.470> behind<00:02:13.070> your<00:02:13.220> vehicle<00:02:13.370> as<00:02:14.000> soon

beeping<00:02:16.040> because<00:02:16.340> they're<00:02:16.489> within<00:02:16.820> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
beeping because they're within the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.610
