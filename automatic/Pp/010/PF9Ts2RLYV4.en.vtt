heard me stress the that conception of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.109 
heard me stress the that conception of
pure<00:00:24.630> skills<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.470> hit<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.920> don't<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.310> hit<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
I guess this caught the attention of

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
I guess this caught the attention of
either<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.839> my<00:00:30.929> subscriber<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> somebody

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
either one of my subscriber of somebody

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
either one of my subscriber of somebody
who<00:00:32.310> just<00:00:32.340> happened<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> stumble<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.360> against

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
who just happened to stumble up against

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.560 
who just happened to stumble up against
one<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.440> videos<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.580> that<00:00:36.030> he<00:00:36.150> asked<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
one of my videos and that he asked a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.490 
one of my videos and that he asked a
very<00:00:37.879> interesting<00:00:38.879> question<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.200> way<00:00:40.350> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
very interesting question and the way of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410 
very interesting question and the way of
the<00:00:41.160> reason<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.460> say<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.850> interesting

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the reason I say very interesting

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.979 
the reason I say very interesting
question<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:45.210> depends<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.930> he

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
question is because it depends on how he

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.250 
question is because it depends on how he
was<00:00:46.320> asking<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> maybe<00:00:47.670> he<00:00:48.449> was<00:00:48.629> asking<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
was asking it maybe he was asking it in

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.510 
was asking it maybe he was asking it in
a<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.559> sarcastic<00:00:49.920> way<00:00:51.680> trying<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.340> my

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a very sarcastic way trying to make my

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240 
a very sarcastic way trying to make my
point<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.539> lesser<00:00:55.020> than<00:00:55.140> his<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.769> maybe<00:00:56.010> he

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
point a lot lesser than his or maybe he

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
point a lot lesser than his or maybe he
was<00:00:56.789> asking<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.539> very<00:00:57.750> honest<00:00:58.320> way

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
