00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 had to have for the fire engine 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:30.920
 brings 33 21 hello and sincerely 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.920
 welcome to a new round 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 do not worry that we are at home with max and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:01:16.720
 so listen to whatever comes to you and quasi 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 never get through ever heard because 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.790
 the same pure that I was not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.689
 I am damned 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.100
 as soon as I set it is 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.100
 maybe only one you can me 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.840
 he said it will stop us 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.320
 view on the very nice really 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:02:09.140
 are still aiming for 1 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:21.680
 seven places free I almost me 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:22.640
 yes, shit, i 'll never be more 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.100
 we come welcome to you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.890
 too weak to drive backwards 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.890
 there is only one possibility 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:56.269
 given that is happening wrapped up 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.080
 he wants one comes in my direction 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.080
 were there 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.220
 all ok the rating is five hot 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.960
 This the players are fighting in planes 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.830
 So all 15 questions about the city center 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.500
 gather 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.760
 the bordwaffen a sheep I was still 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 let's say the building industry 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.630
 you know you can fly 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.840
 I'm not at all 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.310
 Sign here with the wall must 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.860
 but in leaking there you can do it that way 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.660
 control as ever 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:50.580
 But I know that even I want that 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:52.820
 in lower so what's that 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.380
 difficult to be satisfied with a pure 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:04:03.500
 you can also take the rocket's only 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:06.120
 fast times here 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.580
 ich finds so difficult, it is also so 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.130
 difficult that the middle thing goes off 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.530
 I forget what is the best way to go 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.530
 well or communally said yes 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.830
 that does not conclude is that 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.629
 possible we are hollow 30 missiles 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.220
 I'm built by the bestatter 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:33.129
 you caught but yes I still live everything 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.740
 well so all is not well what the 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.389
 most blatant flight of all time 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.310
 did not belong that way 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:48.069
 I believe them all just me 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:56.289
 would have given you then die 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:57.879
 I'm feeling pretty good again 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.259
 drive what that is actually easy 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.669
 too difficult with the left easy 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.669
 not exactly reasonably 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.740
 this is actually a plus of 10 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:58.290
 that was clear is born Rhine is 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:06:01.200
 of course I believe 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:13.410
 for now ten at least thirteen 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:15.570
 just incredible I have to 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.830
 runterstellen what fits happened there 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.830
 his 15th 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.230
 that should be enough only times for 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.460
 Today's result we will be at the next 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.230
 in any case, still a round 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:34.710
 play because that was pretty cool 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:36.480
 So, as always, I would say web 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.610
 and max over and then 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.610
 bite again in the next episode
