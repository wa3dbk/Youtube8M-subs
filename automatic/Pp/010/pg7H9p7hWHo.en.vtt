00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.339
 welcomed by the verses 13 to the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.189
 brand new samsung galaxy we are using this 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.260
 the samsung galaxy note to the market launch 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.830
 will go to in america from september 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.200
 to buy 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 for about 300 dollars in europe wants 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.599
 I too can we can see that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.300
 system straight out i can do it for short 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.400
 make 1,630 truly amoled display and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 we can see beautiful singing couple 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 months advantage only where no black 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.490
 is the display really consumed 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.529
 current corresponding battery life 25 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.570
 hours and more depending on how many times you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 meet that makes as you can see 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 that it is connected here with the samsung 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.680
 galaxy note therefore must the same 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.940
 time exactly the same temperature 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.469
 because the thing you can not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.660
 similar to phone you have to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.610
 really different for here 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.170
 Options select those with the phone 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.850
 connected, I have no motivation here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 I do not use any of those 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.270
 have 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.050
 then I can never know where 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.580
 microphone is here so is the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 speakers I know so I can 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.019
 accepting a call is a new one 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.479
 get which makes the motion and then 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.290
 can accept the same calls 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.200
 then the speaker is relaxed here 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.780
 like I said here on the camera like many 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 megapixel had the 2 megapixel had 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.140
 the camera and here you can see that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.280
 display calculates that 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.200
 probably a storm two musicians on 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.360
 board were also us boys are natural 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.340
 You can control your mobile phone by phone 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.600
 you do not have to be able to stage 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.030
 look through the last pictures 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.350
 It can also control media in it 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.460
 very practical music is heard about the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.869
 stereo system on which the mobile phone 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.240
 connected for example i have 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.369
 Step knife in it also very nice and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.770
 the settings and apps themselves believe 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.509
 I am an exciting crowd because I can 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.009
 Just start different apps here 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.550
 and now I can do it all on the 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.080
 View moon makes it out briefly 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.370
 the apps 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.140
 and then you can see we have 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.290
 really some apps on it too 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.250
 which can use such as camera and 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.160
 then we'll see that too 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.160
 camera I here it forward hello 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.500
 and now i can just do a white job 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.840
 So take a picture by taking a picture 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.380
 that is touching click the photo 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.020
 shot 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.650
 Now you have the photo on the emergency 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.650
 I think so 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.590
 to make now just too stupid gallery 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.970
 or it is not automatic 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.950
 that's exactly what may happen 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.840
 I have to select this first synonymous 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.060
 focus more photos sound the protection 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.520
 Teens are good here the attitude 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.840
 which one can do 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.100
 from the menu comes out you have of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.990
 I've just glided upstairs 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.490
 noticed and videos you can synonymous 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.080
 record by briefly here above left 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.280
 but it only takes ten seconds to click 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.660
 and the 27 p is how you make it again 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.640
 then we can have more windows 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.000
 once, too, knows how to choose 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.060
 beautiful 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.590
 cat on your life and so on and 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 Immediately there are some apps to install 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.140
 can 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.640
 you would like to use yes 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.840
 sometimes too and then we can 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.560
 go on to cabbage for example 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.720
 Can I see who last called 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.770
 nice and fluid all the way here 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.700
 you notice again to contex 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.080
 and then we are back home 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.060
 arrived there were where we started 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.800
 By the way , you can also do it here 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.100
 just when you touch the weather 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.790
 see 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.790
 what you like about it 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.380
 to to and from bottom to top was one 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.130
 Here in styling where I just 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.560
 can select number 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.000
 I press green and then I have to go here 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.380
 The call also start on the samsung 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.300
 galaxy note we'll see each other the same 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.470
 number and of course the number is there 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.910
 not from there, of course, nothing 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.960
 but very nice happen the whole and 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.790
 java still show up 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.170
 The whole thing is a catch as one of 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.430
 high-priced knows so well with 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.720
 this metal story and this page 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.100
 yes it is not fat or similar 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.690
 although here, of course, still electronics 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.970
 rhine flows into the speaker 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.960
 but, as a matter of fact , she is beautiful 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.240
 of course a little thinner here 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.440
 normally not loaded 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.470
 and accordingly, here are the five 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.090
 Metallic connections conceal this 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.130
 Usually this is otherwise a 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.570
 and switch is here and we have 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.640
 otherwise only one microphone on 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.680

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.350
 in which there are also the covers of the 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.540
