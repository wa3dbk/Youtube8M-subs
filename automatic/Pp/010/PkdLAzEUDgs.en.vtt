00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.119
 combine it with these stockings that are 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.789
 they arrive above the arrival at 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.759

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.409

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.410
 and as important things I would say that it has 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 here some details in the area of ​​the neckline 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.490

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.050
 some black leggings and some droplets 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.050
 blots are very cool 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.950
 This is a sweater that I bought the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.730
 month that cost me 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.250

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.590
 knitted and what is cool is that it has 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.090
 chains like patches and stays 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 Pretty cool jerseys 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.099
 this sweatshirt 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.110
 6 as you want to call me the 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.870
 It will compensate me for 1995 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.030
 and what is special is that it has 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.100
 like a hairnet what are the sleeves 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.560
 that does not look very good but they are about 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.140
 I'm going to put my hand to see 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.260
 if I can see the meat 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.020
 if it looks more or less and then it is 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.800
 transparent and also has it to the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.200
 sides of what are the sides 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.810
 here you can also see it looks in my 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.410
 hand my nails and is also very cool is 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 so in tone like brown so broken is 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:41.100
 very pretty too 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:44.040
 this one is fishing and it's a double with 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.810
 a shirt but it's double because it has 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.910
 the top part that is black and the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.330
 bottom part that is like gray 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.250
 and this cost me 12 with 99 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.900
 this was one of my favorite ones the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.360
 I bought in hollister is a shirt from 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.630
 pictures that takes a lot is me the 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.370
 I bought in rebates and it cost me 390 and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.290
 has not yet released and has not yet 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.530
 released and has not yet released for 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.930
 because I was sorry to release it because 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.260
 It is very beautiful I feel sorry that it breaks and 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.120
 in the end, I have not released yet 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.160
 I bought another one in blue of the tones 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.549
 these here from this blue and it's so 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.950
 I have them here we have a sweater that is 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.810
 of red color pulling as well as garnet 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.010
 it's the unequal brand I bought it 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.550
 you work 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.580
 It took me 24 to 50 and we can highlight the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.800
 this jersey that has as well as ones 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.270
 embroidery and here they have sequins and the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.980
 true that some black leggings as 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.330
 they also go well for you because it's like that 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.110
 little laguito 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.629
 ok on the other hand this jersey is here 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.490
 high collar the only thing the only catch 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.770
 what I put is that it is short-sleeved 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.360
 but good with a black jacket as 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.030
 it can look good it's red like that 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.330
 most striking I bought it in Sara and I 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.330
 cost 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.960
 and then we have this other jersey that is 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.479
 very nice pretty fat for now at 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:12.389
 winter again is mango 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:15.120
 It cost me 39 99 and it's black with diamonds like that 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.939
 as in white and in the cuffs are black 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.770
 also the only downside that I put a 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.689
 little that I think that maybe a 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.569
 but little good as yet I have not me 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.830
 released yet I still do not know but nothing 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.270
 the truth is that it is quite fat and I 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:33.139
 like because the winter can continue 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.139
 warm and for the end I left 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.060
 this sweater that is from saná that is not the 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.620
 price because it's a gift from my friend 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.040
 liana that for a certain day if you're 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.420
 watching a kiss and I did not like anything much or 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.860
 do not think it's not released 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.080
 because I will not like it but yes that I 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.210
 like what happens that good because what 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.240
 I would like to say between some things and others 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.920
 I do not have time or in the end you do not 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.480
 you end up always putting the same 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.150
 because I think it has happened to all of us 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.590
 the routine the custom you open the closet 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.600
 The first thing you catch are what you wear 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.880
 and then, of course, in the end, the new 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.120
 then you end up leaving leaving and 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.950
 good as a moral I would tell you to look 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.500
 in our cupboards because it's safe 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.200
 that you have something hidden there that 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.880
 you can still use it and because as 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.470
 I told you I do not have a style 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.960
 defined then I think that all this 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.490
 clothes still so it's still wearing and 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.110
 this year I think I already have to 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.040
 Brand new and I'm looking forward to it if I have to 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.070
 Brand new 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.740
 so nothing she for the end to 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.830
 say goodbye to a purchase that has come 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.960
 today of internet that I made on Wednesday 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.580
 that take very few are from them 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.590
 and it is these booties that are water with 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.560
 a detail here of the zipper and a 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.110
 detail in leopard and then over here 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.100
 they also have some buckles making it 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.900
 ditas this has cost me 46 with 95 a 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.300
 Poquillo expensive but good I liked 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.430
 because they are water booties and because I think 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.560
 that with the leggings and not to spoil 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.480
 the other boots that I have before 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.630
 He has bought them for me and I wanted to share them 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.640
 with you to 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.930
 so that you could see what it takes 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.520
 now for example in booties that 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.330
 so this style is now very much 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.770
 Boots of water and nothing because I hope that you 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.280
 have liked to give the ay if you have 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.150
 liked the favorite if you liked it more 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.190
 Subscribe you will jump as I say 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.020
 always tell me if you want to know 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.390
