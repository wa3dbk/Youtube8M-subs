00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.629
 last year from lg nobody 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.220
 expected no surprises 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.530
 what can I say most 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.309
 analysts blamed the company for risk 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.740
 accounts nevertheless the flagship lg g2 many 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.900
 surprised and made skeptics otherwise 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 look at the future of the Korean company 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.699
 yourself and egais dot ru and a spots sergey 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.289
 goals we look at the sequel 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.410
 flagship line elji 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.510
 namely on lg g3 and try together 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.120
 whether it can be a smartphone 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.250
 develop last year's success and bring it out 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 to a qualitatively different level 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.940
 but first let's remember g2 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 despite the usual arrangement 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.500
 control buttons on the back of a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 also why it’s no secret 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 successful case made of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.430
 glossy plastic this smartphone has become 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 quite successfully no talk about 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.110
 that he shook samsung positions of course 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 not necessary but its the audience 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.350
 smartphone 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.359
 definitely got the blame for that great 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.789
 the camera is a cool display and quite 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.220
 impressive battery life in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.890
 This year, g was already quite different 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.350
 requirements and as a result other expectations 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 everyone was waiting for this year’s flagship 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 a lot and need to say that the Koreans 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.009
 managed to surprise everyone again 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.009
 the highlight of the new device again 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 is its screen got q excellent 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.240
 resolutions that is 2560 by 1440 points 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.210
 with a device diagonal of 5 46 inches 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.439
 values ​​you and reaches 538 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.369
 dots per inch 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.680
 for comparison, the galaxy s5 432 and the verses 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.170
 one eight 441 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970
 as you can see g3 noticeably ahead even 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.110
 despite the fact that its diagonal is larger 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.240
 than a competitor 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.090
 but if you throw aside the numbers then 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.460
 we have to admit that the g3’s screen is nothing 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.950
 stands out from the competition yes he's on 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.130
 good but no more than that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.450
 display resolutions are such numbers 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 redundant though no doubt that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.049
 in a year in all flagships we will see 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.090
 similar display but that's what 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.189
 really need to praise the Koreans 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.550
 so for consistently and narrowing the framework 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.620
 around the display 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.940
 same 3 they became even smaller what to create 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.250
 the impression is all facial 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.830
 the surface of the device is one solid 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.190
 screen speaking in numbers to display 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.500
 now takes 76 and 4 percent useful 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.200
 squares that would remove the logo 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.960
 quite cool despite the fact that jack 3 is 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.790
 real peacock god how i don't like it 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.250
 word or not note that this gadget 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.440
 lying in your hand just fine and everything 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.540
 thanks to the firm bend of the case and 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.530
 new material from which made 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.080
 backside 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.880
 yes it is still plastic but now it 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.670
 not glossy and so strongly felt 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.250
 completely different than the last year's epaulet 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.470
 and this is good the body is still 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.110
 collapsible but do not be afraid of any 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.210
 squeaks and backlash there is no postcard 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.760
 hiding in a 3000 milliamp battery 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.110
 hour of salads for micro sim card and slot 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.420
 for memory cards 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.340
 traditionally lg controls 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.190
 located on the back of the device 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.710
 under the pupil of the camera just take this 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.780
 fact and humbly don't mind that elji 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.970
 decided to remove the LED from the button 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.040
 power before there were two now 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.959
 there is only one left 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.090
 Balakan devices underwent 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.250
 small refining and steel keys 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.470
 a little more brutal click on them was 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.450
 noticeably easier although the need for 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
 this is almost no turn on and 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.480
 turn off the smartphone now you can just 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.610
 double taped on his 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.590
 the screen is left to come up with some gesture 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.360
 adjust the volume of the device from 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.120
 buttons, you can probably refuse 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.560
 it's time to talk about 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.450
 the manufacturer has always been one of 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.400
 few companies that tried 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.739
 use your devices the most 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.470
 advanced iron and forman of this year 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.000
 Of course , j3 is not an exception. 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.610
 quad qualcomm processor 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.770
 snapdragon 801 clocked 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.959
 frequency 2 and 5 gigahertz 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.030
 and 3 gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.100
 despite the fact that in our benchmarks 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.920
 the hero shows quite impressive 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.480
 numbers can not fail to note that g3 is trite 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.000
 brakes and lags 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.640
 probably partly to blame for the high 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.040
 screen resolution partly straight arms 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.170
 programmers but this gadget behavior 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.570
 for 30 thousand rubles in my opinion 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.060
 unacceptable for the game do not worry 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.799
 here everything flies but in the usual tasks in 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.620
 will have to constantly meet with 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.540
 loading 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.729
 watch them from a long animation 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.580
 other pleasures with regard to design 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.100
 operating system thats for yuji so 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.710
 certainly a step forward from g2 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.900
 but everything is still far from their ideals 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.210
 want here and there even look through 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.729
 the material design elements shown in 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.410
 google and oh but generally national 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.150
 Korean flavor is still anyway 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.180
 win as regards recruitment 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.389
 standard features here lg g3 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.190
 corresponds to the whole trend of 2014 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.530
 there is also an embedded application for 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.539
 tracking sports activities and 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.880
 way to control appliances through 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.949
 infrared port and chips like smart 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.789
 turning off the screen if you are not at it 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.710
 look 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.350
 The company itself fuji love to do 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.970
 emphasis on the function button from which 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.130
 allows you to specify a unique combination 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.560
 Taps on the screen to unlock 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.350
 devices in theory this should increase 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.810
 security level of your smartphone 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.150
 tell somebody the guys and that zodzhi 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.610
 their competitors and apple have long been and 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.270
 fingerprint scanner in smartphones 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.580
 g3 works on android 4.2.2 and 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.010
 3000 milliamp hour battery lives in 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.050
 average about 9 hours in viewing mode 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.510
 Internet pages are not welcome 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.360
 playing full hd video see 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.250
 smartphone for 7 hours and heavy 3d games 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.320
 this faster in three 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.500
 the background of all existing flagships on 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.940
 gg3 market is perhaps the most voracious we 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.639
 here and newfangled mode 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.240
 energy saving how are you looking for sevan and 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.400
 it or samsung galaxy s5 so that in the background 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.650
 its competitors g3 will ask to 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.620
 outlet more often and this is probably 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.900
 the main disadvantage of this smartphone especially 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.449
 considering that g2 was a cut above all 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.639
 its competitors if with batteries 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.220
 compared with last year there is a clear 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.050
 downgrade that camera has become definitely 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.520
 better it can not but rejoice 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.289
 first for the first time for mobile 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.720
 devices same 3 technology has been applied 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.760
 laser focusing so the most 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.919
 dynamic frame is no longer in 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.349
 out of focus here now double here 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.630
 flash means bad photo 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.120
 lighting conditions have become even better for 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.360
 13 megapixel camera with optical 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.550
 Stabilization front 2 and 1 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.920
 by the way i have a cool trick for 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.960
 residents selfie if you make a fist 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.250
 the timer will also start automatically 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.540
 the camera can be started using 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.670
 voice command 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.620
 well create sum up you already 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.630
 it turned out to be very interesting 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.730
 recording device look at it in 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.100
 detached from software like 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.470
 piece of iron this gadget is very cool thin 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.170
 frames cool camera super clear display 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.360
 and for the first time j is really comfortable and 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.190
 nice body but if you add on 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.620
 software then immediately 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.020
 there are problems there are not competitors 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.570
 cope with a bang and gg3 a little 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.360
 slows down and stalled of course for 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.220
 it seems over 30 thousand rubles is not the best 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.550
 characteristics however i hope 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.320
 what's to blame no color clear 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.450
 display resolution which in my opinion 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.010
 all the same excess and some 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.830
 software problems that are with 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.810
 update may leave I would like to 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.440
 at least believe in it all 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.480
 was with you 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.010
