came out the ability to have aggregate
news<00:00:14.139> content<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:15.070> ease<00:00:15.250> of<00:00:15.280> people<00:00:15.910> to<00:00:16.059> just

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
caused this gigantic spike up and it's

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.510 
caused this gigantic spike up and it's
all<00:00:20.350> sort<00:00:20.529> of<00:00:20.560> coalesced<00:00:20.949> at<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.130> same<00:00:21.340> time

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
all sort of coalesced at the same time

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.820 
all sort of coalesced at the same time
so<00:00:21.760> it<00:00:21.880> has<00:00:21.970> been<00:00:22.000> so<00:00:22.869> cool<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.199> me<00:00:23.470> not<00:00:23.619> just<00:00:23.710> to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
so it has been so cool to me not just to

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.130 
so it has been so cool to me not just to
see<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.039> rise<00:00:24.220> but<00:00:24.550> to<00:00:24.670> know<00:00:24.820> I<00:00:25.000> know<00:00:25.449> all<00:00:25.810> the

even my friends for the last five years
and<00:00:28.779> that's<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:29.109> really<00:00:29.500> really<00:00:29.800> big<00:00:29.980> treat<00:00:30.250> how

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
and that's a really really big treat how

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
do you see things moving forward if

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.320 
do you see things moving forward if
you're<00:00:32.830> going<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.040> look<00:00:33.129> crystal<00:00:33.879> ball<00:00:34.000> five

you're going to look crystal ball five
years<00:00:34.570> from<00:00:34.660> now<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.790> what's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
years from now I think that what's

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.910 
years from now I think that what's
really<00:00:37.660> exciting<00:00:37.750> about<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.559> eSports

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
really exciting about the eSports

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.950 
really exciting about the eSports
marketplace<00:00:39.520> is<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.940> there's<00:00:40.239> we're

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
marketplace is that there's we're

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.990 
marketplace is that there's we're
getting<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.410> point<00:00:41.590> of<00:00:41.739> too<00:00:41.890> much<00:00:42.040> there's

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
getting to the point of too much there's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.430 
getting to the point of too much there's
too<00:00:43.210> many<00:00:43.300> tournaments<00:00:43.690> there's<00:00:44.079> too<00:00:44.350> many

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
too many tournaments there's too many

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.260 
too many tournaments there's too many
really<00:00:44.800> good<00:00:44.950> players<00:00:45.219> there<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:49.030> only

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
really good players there it so the only

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.000 
really good players there it so the only
way<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.840> it<00:00:49.930> will<00:00:50.020> develop<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.469> improve<00:00:50.530> is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
way that it will develop and improve is

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.069 
way that it will develop and improve is
this<00:00:51.190> one<00:00:51.370> tournament<00:00:51.700> really<00:00:52.660> steps<00:00:52.930> up

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
this one tournament really steps up

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.930 
this one tournament really steps up
their<00:00:53.230> game<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.620> really<00:00:54.190> makes<00:00:54.520> it<00:00:54.670> an<00:00:54.760> even

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
their game and really makes it an even

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.130 
their game and really makes it an even
better<00:00:55.210> production<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:55.750> then<00:00:55.899> all<00:00:56.110> the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
better production and then all the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.439 
better production and then all the
people<00:00:56.649> will<00:00:56.770> vote<00:00:56.949> with<00:00:57.010> their<00:00:57.309> eyeballs<00:00:57.760> so

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
people will vote with their eyeballs so

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.830 
people will vote with their eyeballs so
in<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.600> next<00:00:58.690> five<00:00:58.960> years<00:00:59.199> I<00:00:59.350> see<00:00:59.559> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
in the next five years I see that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.790 
in the next five years I see that
tournament<00:01:01.840> starting<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.289> basically<00:01:02.530> try<00:01:02.710> to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
tournament starting to basically try to

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.200 
tournament starting to basically try to
one-up<00:01:03.100> each<00:01:03.309> other<00:01:03.520> in<00:01:03.789> terms<00:01:04.030> of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
one-up each other in terms of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.150 
one-up each other in terms of
Awesomeness<00:01:04.809> which<00:01:05.080> is<00:01:05.229> an<00:01:05.410> absolute<00:01:05.890> treat

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
Awesomeness which is an absolute treat

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.429 
Awesomeness which is an absolute treat
for<00:01:06.430> all<00:01:06.460> viewers<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.210> all<00:01:07.330> players<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:08.290> is

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
for all viewers and all players it is

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.960 
for all viewers and all players it is
exactly<00:01:08.860> what<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.400> would<00:01:09.520> want<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:09.880> an

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
exactly what you would want in an

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.670 
exactly what you would want in an
industry<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.630> think<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.350> pretty

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
industry so I think that it's pretty

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.840 
industry so I think that it's pretty
much<00:01:11.830> only<00:01:12.070> going<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.400> go<00:01:12.490> up<00:01:12.520> from<00:01:12.820> here

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
much only going to go up from here

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.940 
much only going to go up from here
because<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:13.630> not<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:13.840> expensive<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.770> just

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
because it's not that expensive to just

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.670 
because it's not that expensive to just
start<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.430> stream<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.060> have<00:01:16.150> an<00:01:16.270> event<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
start a stream up and have an event and

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.850 
start a stream up and have an event and
I<00:01:18.400> think<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:20.049> within<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> next<00:01:20.560> 10

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
I think that probably within the next 10

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.230 
I think that probably within the next 10
20<00:01:20.979> years<00:01:21.130> will<00:01:21.430> start<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.670> become<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.939> lot<00:01:22.119> more

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
20 years will start to become a lot more

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.120 
20 years will start to become a lot more
mainstream<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:23.650> are<00:01:23.710> your<00:01:23.830> thoughts<00:01:23.979> about

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
mainstream what are your thoughts about

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.920 
mainstream what are your thoughts about
energy<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:25.030> change<00:01:25.270> they've<00:01:25.509> talked<00:01:25.720> about

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
energy and a change they've talked about

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.690 
energy and a change they've talked about
for<00:01:26.140> next<00:01:26.380> year<00:01:26.560> going<00:01:26.770> longer<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.520> more

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
for next year going longer and more

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.719 
for next year going longer and more
smaller<00:01:28.210> seasons<00:01:28.810> throughout<00:01:29.049> the<00:01:29.229> year<00:01:29.470> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
smaller seasons throughout the year I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.710 
smaller seasons throughout the year I
definitely<00:01:30.729> think<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.090> it's<00:01:31.270> an<00:01:31.329> important

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
definitely think that it's an important

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.600 
definitely think that it's an important
step<00:01:31.900> for<00:01:32.140> all<00:01:32.350> tournaments<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.310> start

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
step for all tournaments to start

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.020 
step for all tournaments to start
thinking<00:01:34.479> more<00:01:34.990> about<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:36.159> best<00:01:36.369> structure

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
thinking more about the best structure

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.359 
thinking more about the best structure
for<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.200> game<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:38.950> observer

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
for the game and for the observer

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.000 
for the game and for the observer
because

it's<00:02:23.310> really<00:02:23.370> fun<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:24.390> me<00:02:24.480> about<00:02:24.660> football

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.900 
season I hardly follow football at all
but<00:02:28.530> there's<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> trickle<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.400> results<00:02:29.850> that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
but there's the trickle of results that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.480 
but there's the trickle of results that
sort<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.240> sneaks<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.350> your<00:02:31.560> brain<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
sort of sneaks in your brain to the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.250 
sort of sneaks in your brain to the
point<00:02:32.760> where<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.060> probably<00:02:33.510> will<00:02:33.870> end<00:02:34.080> up

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
point where I probably will end up

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.600 
point where I probably will end up
having<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.709> favorite<00:02:35.100> for<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> Super<00:02:35.580> Bowl

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
even though I hardly ever follow it so I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.530 
even though I hardly ever follow it so I
think<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.190> experimentation<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:39.030> format<00:02:39.390> is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
think about experimentation of format is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
think about experimentation of format is
so<00:02:39.930> necessary<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.130> same<00:02:41.370> vein<00:02:41.760> along

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
so necessary it's the same vein along

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.360 
so necessary it's the same vein along
with<00:02:42.270> its<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> same<00:02:43.350> vein<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.830> terms

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
with its in the same vein as the terms

with its in the same vein as the terms
these<00:02:44.580> start<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:44.970> one-upping<00:02:45.480> each<00:02:45.600> other

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
these start really one-upping each other

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.170 
these start really one-upping each other
in<00:02:45.989> terms<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.320> content<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.950> yet<00:02:47.910> trying<00:02:48.120> to

in terms of content and yet trying to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.810

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
structure is one of that do you see the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.460 
structure is one of that do you see the

like see signs of it you know because

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.330 
like see signs of it you know because
it's<00:03:00.900> funny<00:03:01.110> too<00:03:01.350> because<00:03:01.920> people<00:03:02.250> are

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.020 
I think what will really help is
environments<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.550> actually<00:03:33.760> think

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
environments like this actually think

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.640

that<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.270> this<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.020> key<00:03:35.200> I'm<00:03:35.349> not<00:03:35.470> even

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
that this is this is key I'm not even

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.140 
that this is this is key I'm not even
being<00:03:35.800> like<00:03:36.069> pay<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.310> say<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.819> actually<00:03:36.910> think

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
being like pay to say I actually think

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.160

things and I'll be really good and
you're<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.209> great<00:04:07.390> point<00:04:07.569> but

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you're like that's a great point but

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.699 
you're like that's a great point but
what<00:04:07.870> about<00:04:08.049> this<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.530> all<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.680> sudden

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
what about this and all of a sudden

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.229 
what about this and all of a sudden
conversations<00:04:09.459> happening<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.970> level<00:04:10.209> of

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
conversations happening in the level of

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.050 
conversations happening in the level of
play<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.569> elevating<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.739> that's<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.819> think

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
play is elevating so that's that I think

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.720 
play is elevating so that's that I think
it's<00:04:13.209> absolutely<00:04:13.390> essential
