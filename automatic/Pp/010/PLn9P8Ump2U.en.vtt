00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
know I guess the greenhouse and we used

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.469 
know I guess the greenhouse and we used
to<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.549> shed<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> was

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to have a shed here but it was

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
to have a shed here but it was
completely<00:01:18.630> separate<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.340> structure

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
completely separate from the structure

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.230 
completely separate from the structure
of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> house<00:01:21.409> one<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> purposes<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.970> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
of the house one of the purposes also is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
of the house one of the purposes also is
that<00:01:24.770> gives<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that gives you a little bit of

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
that gives you a little bit of
protection<00:01:26.549> from<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> weather<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
protection from the weather when you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.620 
protection from the weather when you
come<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.799> back<00:01:29.130> porch<00:01:29.430> used<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> get

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
come out on the back porch used to get

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
come out on the back porch used to get
buffeted<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.140> wind<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.040> snow<00:01:32.280> would

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
buffeted by wind and snow would

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.620 
buffeted by wind and snow would
accumulate<00:01:33.420> there

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

so<00:01:38.260> hopefully<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.710> can<00:01:38.800> store<00:01:39.400> all<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.650> banana

at<00:02:03.670> all<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.290> most

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
at all and this is gonna be the most

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.730 
at all and this is gonna be the most
difficult<00:02:06.750> wall<00:02:07.750> right<00:02:08.080> here<00:02:08.320> because<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.590> have

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
difficult wall right here because I have

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.030 
difficult wall right here because I have
this<00:02:08.860> space<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:11.020> don't<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.560> critters<00:02:11.920> to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
this space that I don't want critters to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.550 
this space that I don't want critters to
go<00:02:12.190> into<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:12.850> I'm<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.770> nail<00:02:14.770> some<00:02:15.360> rigid<00:02:16.360> foam

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:30.470 

to<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.620> side<00:02:20.920> here<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:27.630> it'll<00:02:28.630> extend<00:02:29.350> off

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
to the side here so it'll extend off

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.750 
to the side here so it'll extend off
this<00:02:31.480> side<00:02:31.780> till<00:02:32.140> which<00:02:32.830> won't<00:02:33.100> get<00:02:33.280> any<00:02:33.430> Sun

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
this side till which won't get any Sun

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.130 
this side till which won't get any Sun
until<00:02:34.120> after<00:02:34.480> noon<00:02:34.660> time<00:02:36.870> hopefully<00:02:37.870> it'll<00:02:37.989> be

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
until after noon time hopefully it'll be

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.729 
until after noon time hopefully it'll be
warm<00:02:38.380> enough<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:39.959> keep<00:02:40.959> my<00:02:41.140> plants<00:02:41.590> from

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
warm enough to keep my plants from

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.870 
warm enough to keep my plants from
freezing<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.860> also<00:02:45.010> covers<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.580> steps

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
freezing and it also covers the steps

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.150 
freezing and it also covers the steps
here<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.890> don't<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:47.980> rain<00:02:48.190> going<00:02:48.400> into<00:02:48.670> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
here I don't have rain going into the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.670 
here I don't have rain going into the
area<00:02:52.769> did<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:54.660> put<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.810> cement<00:02:56.170> down<00:02:56.380> last

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
area did I put this cement down last

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
area did I put this cement down last
year<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.930> meant<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.799> project

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
year and I meant to do this as a project

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.940 
year and I meant to do this as a project
so<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.600> summer<00:03:01.840> time<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.380> didn't<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.769> around

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
so the summer time I didn't get around

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.149 
so the summer time I didn't get around
to<00:03:03.160> it

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.119 

I<00:03:06.189> made<00:03:06.730> some<00:03:07.000> progress<00:03:07.209> framing<00:03:08.079> up<00:03:08.230> this

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
I made some progress framing up this

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.640 
I made some progress framing up this
wall<00:03:09.459> here<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:11.230> purchased<00:03:12.159> these<00:03:13.650> hopper

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
wall here I purchased these hopper

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.099 
wall here I purchased these hopper
windows<00:03:15.099> or<00:03:15.519> cellar<00:03:15.939> windows<00:03:16.420> from<00:03:16.840> Home

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
windows or cellar windows from Home

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.069 
windows or cellar windows from Home
Depot<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.569> originally<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.599> was<00:03:19.750> going<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.930> put

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
Depot and originally I was going to put

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.280 
Depot and originally I was going to put
them<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.379> bottom<00:03:20.560> thinking<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:22.290> I'd

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
them on the bottom thinking that I'd

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.330 
them on the bottom thinking that I'd
have<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.680> back<00:03:23.859> windows<00:03:24.340> open<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.890> would

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
have the back windows open and I would

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.819 
have the back windows open and I would
draw<00:03:27.579> her<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:27.849> cool<00:03:28.120> there<00:03:28.450> but<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.379> butts<00:03:29.650> up

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
draw her in cool there but this butts up

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.899 
draw her in cool there but this butts up
against<00:03:30.780> asphalt<00:03:31.780> driveway<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.409> I<00:03:32.950> don't

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
against asphalt driveway so I don't

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.670 
against asphalt driveway so I don't
think<00:03:33.970> there's<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.420> any<00:03:34.599> cool<00:03:35.500> layer

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
think there's going to be any cool layer

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.479 
think there's going to be any cool layer
to<00:03:35.859> be<00:03:35.980> had<00:03:36.159> so<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:37.230> figured<00:03:38.230> put<00:03:38.859> them<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.069> put

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
to be had so I figured put them up put

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.160 
to be had so I figured put them up put
them<00:03:39.519> up<00:03:39.670> at<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.909> top<00:03:40.120> there<00:03:40.480> where<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.900> hot

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
them up at the top there where the hot

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.789 
them up at the top there where the hot
air<00:03:41.319> is<00:03:41.409> going<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.590> be<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.420> hopefully<00:03:43.420> that

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
air is going to be and hopefully that

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.849 
air is going to be and hopefully that
keeps<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.950> greenhouse<00:03:46.290> cool<00:03:47.290> or<00:03:47.620> be<00:03:47.769> able

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
keeps the greenhouse cool or be able

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.280 
keeps the greenhouse cool or be able
I'll<00:03:48.760> be<00:03:48.939> able<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.209> regulate<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.810> temperature

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
I'll be able to regulate the temperature

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.929 
I'll be able to regulate the temperature
a<00:03:50.319> little<00:03:50.530> bit<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.400> opening<00:03:51.790> those

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
a little bit with the opening those

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.440 
a little bit with the opening those
windows<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:54.400> that's<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:57.000> that's<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.299> one

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
windows but that's the that's the one

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.149 
windows but that's the that's the one
wall<00:03:58.689> there<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.349> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> be<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.829> largest

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
wall there it's going to be the largest

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.050 
wall there it's going to be the largest
wall<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.790> faces<00:04:00.819> south<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.700> hardest

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
wall that faces south so the hardest

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.069 
wall that faces south so the hardest
part<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.930> going<00:04:05.169> to<00:04:05.409> be<00:04:05.620> cutting<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:07.450> rafters

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
part is going to be cutting the rafters

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.339 
part is going to be cutting the rafters
for<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.409> roof<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:08.950> I've<00:04:09.280> got<00:04:10.109> I've<00:04:11.109> got

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
for the roof because I've got I've got

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.949 
for the roof because I've got I've got
the<00:04:11.560> nailers<00:04:12.069> on<00:04:12.400> two<00:04:13.120> sides<00:04:13.419> it's<00:04:13.840> an

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
the nailers on two sides it's an

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.529 
the nailers on two sides it's an
l-shaped<00:04:16.769> lean-to<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:17.799> guess<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.549> I<00:04:18.849> have<00:04:19.419> to

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
l-shaped lean-to I guess and I have to

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.129 
l-shaped lean-to I guess and I have to
figure<00:04:19.750> out<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.139> angles<00:04:20.590> for<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:22.539> rafters

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
figure out the angles for the rafters

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.310 
figure out the angles for the rafters
when<00:04:23.409> they<00:04:24.330> thought<00:04:25.330> up<00:04:25.510> against<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.080> nailer

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
when they thought up against the nailer

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.100 
when they thought up against the nailer
and<00:04:26.530> then<00:04:26.919> I'm<00:04:27.639> not<00:04:27.909> certain<00:04:28.539> if<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.780> want<00:04:29.020> to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
and then I'm not certain if I want to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.110 
and then I'm not certain if I want to
cut<00:04:29.430> or<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.460> should<00:04:30.940> cut<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> bird's<00:04:31.599> mouth<00:04:31.750> into

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
cut or I should cut a bird's mouth into

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.029 
cut or I should cut a bird's mouth into
the<00:04:34.120> rafter<00:04:34.599> when<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.960> sits<00:04:35.199> on<00:04:35.349> top<00:04:35.409> of<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
the rafter when it sits on top of the

the rafter when it sits on top of the
wall<00:04:36.599> plate<00:04:37.599> and<00:04:38.190> then<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.310> have<00:04:39.550> an<00:04:40.090> angled

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
wall plate and then I have an angled

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.180 
wall plate and then I have an angled
corner<00:04:41.849> rafters<00:04:42.849> that<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:44.380> have<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.740> figure<00:04:45.039> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
corner rafters that I have to figure the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.570 
corner rafters that I have to figure the
angles<00:04:45.580> on<00:04:45.849> too<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:46.479> don't<00:04:46.630> know<00:04:46.750> how<00:04:47.580> how

angles on too and I don't know how how

angles on too and I don't know how how
to<00:04:48.639> do<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.120> I'm<00:04:49.300> going<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.539> try<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.780> see<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.560> I

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
to do that I'm going to try to see if I

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.670 
to do that I'm going to try to see if I
can<00:04:51.570> read<00:04:52.570> up<00:04:52.720> on<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.260> find<00:04:53.470> some

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
can read up on it and find some

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.649 
can read up on it and find some
information<00:04:53.949> on<00:04:54.490> how<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.610> figure<00:04:55.000> that<00:04:55.180> out<00:04:55.240> or

information on how to figure that out or

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.890 
information on how to figure that out or
just<00:04:55.900> slowly<00:04:56.889> cut<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.370> angles<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:59.669> by<00:05:00.900> trial

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
just slowly cut the angles and by trial

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.480 
just slowly cut the angles and by trial
and<00:05:02.050> error<00:05:02.229> see<00:05:02.530> if<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.710> can<00:05:02.830> get<00:05:02.949> those<00:05:03.130> angles

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
and error see if I can get those angles

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.740 
and error see if I can get those angles
correct<00:05:03.940> but<00:05:04.659> that's<00:05:04.870> gonna<00:05:05.020> be<00:05:05.259> a<00:05:05.289> difficult

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
correct but that's gonna be a difficult

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.740 
correct but that's gonna be a difficult
part<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:08.080> guess<00:05:08.919> once<00:05:09.159> I<00:05:09.310> get<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:10.150> angles<00:05:10.570> down

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
part I guess once I get the angles down

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.390 
part I guess once I get the angles down
I<00:05:10.810> can<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.470> know

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
I can you know

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.860 
I can you know
the<00:05:12.850> rafters<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.300> will<00:05:13.600> repeat<00:05:15.750> once<00:05:16.750> they

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
the rafters that will repeat once they

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.540 
the rafters that will repeat once they
get<00:05:16.960> those<00:05:17.139> angles<00:05:17.470> down<00:05:17.710> I'll<00:05:17.980> be<00:05:18.160> able<00:05:18.250> to

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
get those angles down I'll be able to

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.540 
get those angles down I'll be able to
you<00:05:19.480> know<00:05:19.600> cut<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.900> couple<00:05:20.139> of<00:05:20.350> you<00:05:20.979> know<00:05:21.070> copies

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
you know cut a couple of you know copies

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.000 
you know cut a couple of you know copies
of<00:05:21.729> those<00:05:21.910> angles<00:05:22.620> but<00:05:23.620> it's<00:05:23.770> going<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.919> be

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
of those angles but it's going to be

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.670 
of those angles but it's going to be
slow<00:05:24.250> going<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:27.210> let's<00:05:28.210> see<00:05:28.510> how<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.660> get<00:05:28.840> that

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
slow going so let's see how I get that

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:41.120 
slow going so let's see how I get that
done

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.150 

here's<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.340> mock-up<00:05:42.729> of<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.000> acrylic<00:05:43.270> panel

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.150 

and<00:05:48.160> these<00:05:48.340> are<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:49.259> rails<00:05:50.259> that<00:05:50.470> go<00:05:50.830> on

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
and these are the rails that go on

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.589 
and these are the rails that go on
either<00:05:51.310> side<00:05:51.729> of<00:05:53.849> aluminum<00:05:54.849> rails<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.300> go<00:05:55.330> on

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
either side of aluminum rails that go on

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.749 
either side of aluminum rails that go on
either<00:05:56.020> side<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.620> acrylic<00:05:56.800> panel<00:05:57.099> the<00:05:57.400> the

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 
either side of the acrylic panel the the

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.409 
either side of the acrylic panel the the
panels<00:05:58.120> are<00:05:58.620> four<00:05:59.620> by<00:05:59.800> eight<00:05:59.830> sheets<00:06:00.419> well

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
panels are four by eight sheets well

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.540 
panels are four by eight sheets well
they<00:06:01.569> think<00:06:01.870> they<00:06:02.169> were<00:06:02.289> four<00:06:02.530> by<00:06:02.710> sixteen<00:06:03.099> and

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
they think they were four by sixteen and

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.790 
they think they were four by sixteen and
they<00:06:04.539> cut<00:06:04.720> them<00:06:04.840> in<00:06:04.930> half<00:06:05.110> for<00:06:05.410> me<00:06:05.620> where<00:06:05.770> I

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
they cut them in half for me where I

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.580 
they cut them in half for me where I
purchased<00:06:06.340> them<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:06.699> I<00:06:06.729> could<00:06:06.849> get<00:06:07.030> them<00:06:07.180> home

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.730 

so<00:06:11.590> I'll<00:06:11.680> be<00:06:11.800> usable<00:06:12.810> just<00:06:13.810> now<00:06:16.530> directly<00:06:17.530> to

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
so I'll be usable just now directly to

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.659 
so I'll be usable just now directly to
the<00:06:17.860> stud<00:06:19.590> like<00:06:20.590> that<00:06:20.800> and<00:06:21.039> I<00:06:21.069> just<00:06:21.310> slide<00:06:21.520> the

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
the stud like that and I just slide the

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:28.529 
the stud like that and I just slide the
panels<00:06:22.000> in<00:06:22.150> between<00:06:26.759> so<00:06:27.759> surprisingly<00:06:28.330> it's

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
panels in between so surprisingly it's

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.320 
panels in between so surprisingly it's
80<00:06:28.750> to<00:06:28.960> 82<00:06:29.409> degrees<00:06:29.949> it<00:06:30.099> was<00:06:30.220> 80<00:06:30.400> yesterday<00:06:30.639> and

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
80 to 82 degrees it was 80 yesterday and

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.480 
80 to 82 degrees it was 80 yesterday and
we<00:06:31.479> had<00:06:31.659> a<00:06:33.389> 39<00:06:34.389> degree<00:06:34.810> low<00:06:35.080> a<00:06:35.409> couple<00:06:36.220> of<00:06:36.310> days

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
we had a 39 degree low a couple of days

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.830 
we had a 39 degree low a couple of days
ago<00:06:39.659> that's<00:06:40.659> the<00:06:40.900> progress<00:06:41.139> so<00:06:41.590> far<00:06:42.840> they

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
ago that's the progress so far they

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.890 
ago that's the progress so far they
still<00:06:44.110> have<00:06:44.289> to<00:06:44.500> drill<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:44.949> holes<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.900> bolt

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
still have to drill the holes to bolt

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.200 
still have to drill the holes to bolt
that<00:06:47.139> into<00:06:47.409> the<00:06:47.500> concrete<00:06:47.969> also

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.249 

so<00:06:52.810> hopefully<00:06:53.199> I'll<00:06:54.130> have<00:06:54.400> this<00:06:54.520> done<00:06:55.259> you'll

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
so hopefully I'll have this done you'll

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:17.940 
so hopefully I'll have this done you'll
see

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.220 

so<00:07:18.490> that's<00:07:18.700> the<00:07:18.820> progress<00:07:19.240> I've<00:07:19.450> made<00:07:19.690> so<00:07:19.930> far

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.230 
so that's the progress I've made so far

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.690 
so that's the progress I've made so far
and<00:07:22.170> I'll<00:07:23.170> have<00:07:23.350> two<00:07:23.560> of<00:07:23.710> these<00:07:23.830> windows<00:07:24.460> I'll

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 
and I'll have two of these windows I'll

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.210 
and I'll have two of these windows I'll
have<00:07:24.850> one<00:07:25.090> there<00:07:25.360> and<00:07:25.630> one<00:07:25.690> on<00:07:26.620> the<00:07:26.740> opposite

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220 
have one there and one on the opposite

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.990 
have one there and one on the opposite
side<00:07:28.320> and<00:07:29.320> hopefully<00:07:29.890> when<00:07:30.160> I<00:07:30.190> have<00:07:30.430> them<00:07:30.610> open

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
side and hopefully when I have them open

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.620 
side and hopefully when I have them open
and<00:07:31.180> have<00:07:31.840> the<00:07:31.960> back<00:07:32.170> windows<00:07:32.530> open<00:07:33.630> maybe

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.630 
and have the back windows open maybe

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.020 
and have the back windows open maybe
I'll<00:07:34.810> have<00:07:34.990> to<00:07:35.170> install<00:07:35.590> event<00:07:36.580> because<00:07:36.910> I

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
I'll have to install event because I

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.720 
I'll have to install event because I
think<00:07:37.090> even<00:07:37.620> with<00:07:38.620> as<00:07:38.770> many<00:07:38.890> windows<00:07:39.250> as<00:07:39.430> you

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:39.730 
think even with as many windows as you

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.150 
think even with as many windows as you
can<00:07:39.910> have<00:07:40.090> on<00:07:40.240> a<00:07:40.270> green<00:07:40.570> house<00:07:40.780> it's<00:07:41.050> like<00:07:41.160> you

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 
can have on a green house it's like you

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.950 
can have on a green house it's like you
know<00:07:42.280> being<00:07:42.520> in<00:07:42.700> a<00:07:42.790> hot<00:07:42.970> car<00:07:43.240> with<00:07:43.300> all<00:07:43.810> the

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 
know being in a hot car with all the

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.230 
know being in a hot car with all the
windows<00:07:44.230> open<00:07:44.410> it<00:07:44.770> still<00:07:45.010> gets<00:07:45.190> pretty<00:07:45.790> hot<00:07:46.030> in

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
windows open it still gets pretty hot in

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.450 
windows open it still gets pretty hot in
there

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
there

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.760 
there
so<00:07:48.460> you'll<00:07:49.180> see<00:07:49.360> how<00:07:49.510> difficult<00:07:50.440> it<00:07:50.590> is<00:07:50.620> to

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:50.770 
so you'll see how difficult it is to

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.410 
so you'll see how difficult it is to
regulate<00:07:51.310> the<00:07:51.460> temperature<00:07:51.970> during<00:07:52.210> the

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.420 
regulate the temperature during the

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.230 
regulate the temperature during the
summer<00:07:52.870> months<00:07:52.990> at<00:07:53.410> least<00:07:53.620> hopefully<00:07:54.240> you

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 
summer months at least hopefully you

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.000 
summer months at least hopefully you
know<00:07:55.360> keypoint<00:07:55.810> plants<00:07:56.170> nice<00:07:56.290> and<00:07:56.530> warm<00:07:56.770> in

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.010 
know keypoint plants nice and warm in

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.640 
know keypoint plants nice and warm in
the<00:07:57.040> winter<00:07:57.100> time<00:07:57.490> or<00:07:58.420> above<00:07:59.050> freezing<00:07:59.230> at

00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.650 
the winter time or above freezing at

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.880 
the winter time or above freezing at
least<00:08:00.720> so<00:08:01.720> thanks<00:08:02.020> for<00:08:02.140> watching<00:08:02.470> this<00:08:02.530> video
