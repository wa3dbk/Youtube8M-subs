00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.200
 in the vicinity of the reserve of the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.750
 biosphere of the archipelago of 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.180
 revillagigedo to about 400 kilometers to the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 southwest of cabo san lucas a group of 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.100
 divers detected a whale shark that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.280
 had a thick rope around the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.280
 body 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
 we are talking about a front rope 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.500
 it would be about three inches thick or more 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.930
 less but then the rope and really already 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.759
 I was doing a lot of damage to what is 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.270
 the body of the animal the whale shark 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.520
 is the biggest fish on the planet this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.860
 exemplary was a pregnant female that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.730
 It was about 10 meters long with a 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 Approximate weight of more than 15 tons 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.900
 for the sores it showed is estimated 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.629
 it had been a long time 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.600
 hurting this rope by the size 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.790
 of the animal and the damage he had already done 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.540
 version is difficult to quantify in 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.210
 years but I do not know maybe not much more than 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.890
 that's because the body of the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 animal was growing on the rope already 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.020
 really was really marking the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.930
 diver daniel zapata made two 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.900
 dives for the rescue the first 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.750
 he was studying in a second dive to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.830
 about 28 or 30 meters deep 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.830
 daniel decided to act 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.299
 when nothing else was as soon as 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.580
 you saw about him and this one now that 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.190
 with a knife in hand and let's go and in the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.110
 first bust I had a part time 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.180
 to inspect the rope in which part 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.979
 was the thinnest to be able to say in 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.540
 the second bust this is my point no 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.710
 I have to go and cut the rope and 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 really like that because of how it happened 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 the whale shark cooperated to be 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.370
 released really the animal never 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.400
 altered at all even in its form 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.619
 of swimming everything remained I kept the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.909
 xv speed of the animal 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.920
 apparently this rope belonged to 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.100
 an anchoring system that being at the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.740
 drift caught this whale shark 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.990
 as often happens with other networks 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.860
 abandoned in this area that for its 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.720
 remoteness and extension are poorly monitored 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.020
 in the end he had satisfaction for the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.020
 rescue 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.959
 all amazed everyone grateful the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.740
 Diver has received congratulations for this 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.720
 rescue 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.790
 to an email from two little girls of the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.160
 primary who want to be biologists 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.730
 marinas and who sent him to come Daniel 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.100
 zapata thank you for rescuing a 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.240
 marine animal that is what they want 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.240
 make them with life 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.200
 and arming figueredo meganoticias the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.200
