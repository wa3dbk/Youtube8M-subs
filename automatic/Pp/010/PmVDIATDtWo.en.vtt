00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:15.920
 and as I said it was to make bitter 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:18.169
 now it has to go over all the whole 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.849
 good boarding we had there 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.369
 one can already say in three four five 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.979
 years will be the vacancies if they 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.399
 not be sold that is always 

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.399
 heavy 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.860
 that was special to me in particular 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 endangered patients had the very 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.440
 restless were driving very aggressively or 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440
 in the ocean 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.989
 two in the toughest decisions 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.940
 I do not want me in retrospect 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.100
 say regrets there are also breaks in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.100
 biographies that are useful 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.870
 we actually allow 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.070
 they fight mine 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.550
 it's just interesting to do it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.550
 to destroy 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.560
 have the bomb now missed the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.090
 reasons have never been clarified 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.470
 maybe just in 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.470
 microsecond error of the pilot 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.010
 and that's really a lot of fun 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 Tears have flowed and everyone is currently 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.270
 drummed after 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.220
 a student who studied then he had 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.330
 with that we are with the steps the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.330
 we have not seen it yet 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.920
 I have to say honestly we always have 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.860
 said our old ones that were not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.180
 derogatory that was a not obey that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.180
 it was entertained 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.740
 you actually had the hope that 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.450
 also continued is then said 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.229
 this goethe room rat and that beautiful 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.229
 then prepared 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470
 that's just ours in high dahl
