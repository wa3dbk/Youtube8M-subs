00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hello girls how are you

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:19.760
 sun and pool time to take care of the hair 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:21.680
 So come with me, somebody who follows me 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.380
 instagram and on facebook you know that I 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.630
 I stayed ten days at the beach with lots of sun 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.970
 lots of beach lots of park 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.920
 I really enjoyed myself. 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.260
 I confess to you my hair stayed 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.610
 almost nothing dry because I took the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.100
 care that I told you that I 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.480
 I made a post before traveling I left 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.760
 down here you guys have a lot 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.550
 To talk in the video only, but to whom. 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.310
 came back from the beach with dry hair on 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.630
 sun in the pool very chlorine hair back 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.880
 like that, right? 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.310
 so come on, how to recover the hair 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.200
 after the beach after the beach and then 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.850
 lots of pool 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.170
 The first tip is when you get the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.690
 beach the first thing I know how to do 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.150
 is to wash the hair well wash with shampoo 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.449
 anti-waste material to remove all 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.740
 excess of health grease because 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.960
 stay in the hair 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.300
 I used this time here, natura plant. 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.400
 which is good does not make hair hard 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.500
 but does a good cleaning and leaves the 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.390
 hair with enough means that back the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.730
 hair regains after this 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.110
 deep cleaning will make a 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.820
 reconstruction 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.410
 same day immediately after washing with 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.450
 this show to do the reconstruction 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.860
 choose this moisturizing mask from 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.740
 pantene intense moisturizing mask 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.240
 like liquid keratin that was more 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.190
 as I did the first apply to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.650
 keratin I left acting for five 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.770
 minutes later apply is to mark up 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.330
 keratin and traveled over 20 minutes and 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.180
 then rinse thoroughly 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.640
 I finished with it comes the Zenit here gives 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.200
 boot is the well harry yeff leaves hair 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 well , but it can be a link that you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.729
 at home after two days or at the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
 next to the wash when you go to talk 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.510
 of the hair again 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.480
 are 30 minutes with a well-marked 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.180
 moisturizer I chose the ox is 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.810
 grows for what I really like and it's 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.600
 This one's been here for a long time and 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.430
 concentration is very good 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.010
 after two days at the next wash 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.260
 you will make a quick hydration of 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.570
 three minutes three to ten minutes with 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.390
 a mask plus an environment, I'm 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.270
 I indicate this from the al if you can use 3 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.990
 5 minutes 10 minutes maximum at 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.120
 hair 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.850
 with this date here both give a 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.890
 effect in hair is to do this 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.620
 hydration just after washing the hair with 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.170
 normal shampoo okay will make 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.480
 application and will wait for the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.580
 will play only this may end 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.260
 with linen, it's okay 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.600
 after two days or the next 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.550
 wash again you will make a 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.310
 voltage with time may vegetable oil 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.470
 be any extra virgin vegetable I 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.600
 I chose coconut oil 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.600
 it is net because over 25 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.340
 degrees and gets liquid but it stays 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.510
 usually in the form of a paste 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.549
 white 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.010
 I use any brand as long as it is 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.959
 vegetable and extra time rock to make 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.600
 you will stay in dry hair meditation 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.480
 dirty mecha by mecha from top to bottom 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.489
 including in the root to leave for some 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.880
 two hours and then wash with shampoo 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.890
 nbb not deep cleaning can be okay 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.200
 a shampoo from the rock that he shines end 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.090
 You know I like it a lot. 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.970
 or it may be that the child and the for 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.110
 who tries ocean because you have 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.600
 transparent a team and your hair 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.519
 do not look heavy after 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.620
 after washing with shampoo will end 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.390
 with the conditioner and then how it 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.000
 it's usually good 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.709
 then on the next dam again 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.239
 without a break you do more 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.489
 hydration can be a hydration 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.590
 with a 30-minute hydration 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.390
 with the cap because the vote did not 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.739
 overload the wires you can do 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.620
 how many times do you want it not 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.150
 It's overload, no problem. 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.069
 even business hair can do 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 As many times as you want, you just can not pass 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.459

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.140
