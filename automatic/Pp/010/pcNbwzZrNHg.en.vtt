00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.850
 fine 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.140
 My name is Robson, I'm a legitimate. 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:32.570
 source the game what flashes 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.030
 my nick nightwalker 175 game by 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.160
 at least four hours a day 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.150
 I go to several forums spending money 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.370
 with items characters etc at last the sound 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.019
 full addict or rather I was me 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.629
 I arrived at the house that day. 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.510
 I took a shower I had dinner did duty 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.460
 I went home and went to play when I 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.680
 I saw that I had received a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.129
 friend request from a user with 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.530
 the mic 666 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.500
 I was surprised I had seen many 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.460
 users with 666 digits in the media but 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.600
 not just with these dreams or accept the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.180
 solicitation 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.189
 despite his estranged him that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.330
 soon after I saw that winning the 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.659
 gift 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.799
 I was surprised once more by the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.450
 character 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.280
 At first I was surprised because I never 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.289
 had won the game character at 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.999
 more but I was even more surprised 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.409
 when I clicked character to 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.840
 analyze it 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.479
 he had the form of a normal man was 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.789
 completely black without any 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.799
 feature you this house 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:46.579
 but what really scared me 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:50.060
 It was the 9666 what the fuck 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.859
 I thought with myself despite all this I 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.969
 I was curious to know what it was like 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.399
 character 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.159
 I then entered the game, I selected 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.959
 he and I started to play 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.819
 I expected all the players 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.340
 ask what that character was 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.600
 all black but nobody asked anything 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.899
 about this 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.920
 I started heading for the 2 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.500
 enemies 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.450
 when the character your first talks or 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.470
 I almost had a heart attack 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.470
 unlike all others 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.650
 characters he did not have a beautiful voice 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.620
 On the contrary, his voice was somber and 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.019
 language he was talking about 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.000
 Portuguese was more like a language 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.590
 scandinavian something totally sinister 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.530
 when some troops approached 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.780
 I got back my first power 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.549
 in the beginning nothing happened but three 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.860
 seconds later all the troops that 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.829
 were on the screen were cut in half 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.640
 of her blood has spread through all 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.739
 sides 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.329
 instead of disappearing them 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.099
 remained there as if they were 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.430
 becoming part of the scenario 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.250
 What the hell is that? I started playing. 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.500
 from its launch and then I never 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.750
 had seen so much violence in that game 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.549
 I was completely scared 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.220
 at that moment but my curiosity 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.480
 It had always been bigger than everything. 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.480
 I approached the engine 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.480
 she started shooting at me but to 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.879
 To my surprise, I realized that I was not 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.620
 taking any damage is as if the 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.319
 character was immortal 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.690
 suddenly second power was deleted 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.310
 click action this time was immediate 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.019
 the two friends who were close to 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.239
 I was cut by a gray mist 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.230
 which left him paralyzed for five 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.750
 seconds 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.440
 then the heads explode an I 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.889
 I could hear screams of pain and agony. 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.769
 deafening 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:41.049
 I threw a headset away 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.049
 in fact what I really wanted was 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.109
 turn off that damn game but something 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.340
 inside me some voice from that panel 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.989
 continues with just obeying 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.730
 after that I saw that all the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.280
 my team players noticed 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.769
 absences from two enemies but they 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.260
 ignored this when the game was 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.129
 approaching the end of the third power was 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.560
 able 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.049
 I did not want to stay in that shit anymore. 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.329
 my finger automatically clicked the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.730
 circle of fire came around me 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.889
 then they april broke all 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.320
 troops of remaining enemies 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.780
 but when I noticed players of my 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.229
 team were also burning at the end 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.729
 all died in the character destroy the 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:29.650
 Enemy nexus alone and the game ended 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.419
 focused on all that violence that 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.669
 sign I had never seen in that game 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.920
 before I turned the computer off 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.750
 Ha, ha, and I went to sleep. 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.490
 that night I had a nightmare 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.730
 I dreamed about the boy who was playing. 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.230
 at the beach the bodies caught fire at them 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.630
 they died burned 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.700
 when I woke up the next day I called 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.770
 my tv to try and empty my 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.410
 mind of all that bloodbath that 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.600
 I witnessed when I put the news 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.200
 to see news that was passing the 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.880
 following report this morning three 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.890
 girls and a boy died burnt 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.060
 in front of the computer when they 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.160
 were found by relatives 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.960
 they were charred 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.490
 why this happened 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.560
 complete mystery 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.330
 the police warned the rooms of the 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.850
 teenagers to see if there was anything 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.310
 could have caused such accidents not 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.230
 was found nothing to analyze their 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.260
 computers was seen that the rooms 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:30.830
 they had one thing in common, everyone was 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:33.440
 playing link flex game i froze from 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.940
 cilic rtv I could not believe 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.090

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:43.370

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:47.420

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.310
 where the process has sounded for the moment 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.550
 I finished I heard the voice of the character 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.630
 also the head then I started to 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.240
 catch fire 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.920
 The pain I felt was intense, I closed it. 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.190
 eyes the last thing that went through 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.940
 my mind was that character who 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.220
 now had a pair of red eyes and 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.810
 scary
