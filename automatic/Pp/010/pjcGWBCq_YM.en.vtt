once been debated for a while in the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.430 
once been debated for a while in the
late<00:00:39.540> 90s<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.230> did<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.730> Marvel<00:00:41.730> vs.<00:00:42.149> DC<00:00:42.480> and

late 90s they did a Marvel vs. DC and
they<00:00:43.890> had<00:00:44.010> fans<00:00:44.340> vote<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.940> Superman<00:00:45.649> narrowly

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
they had fans vote and Superman narrowly

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.600 
they had fans vote and Superman narrowly
won<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.610> pretty<00:00:47.850> damn<00:00:48.059> close<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
won that it was pretty damn close and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.500 
won that it was pretty damn close and
probably<00:00:50.610> close<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> lot<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> people

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
probably close and a lot of people

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
probably close and a lot of people
thought<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.750> would<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.110> been<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.860> think

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
thought it would have been and I think

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
thought it would have been and I think
it's<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.090> Superman<00:00:54.449> has

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's just because the way Superman has

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
it's just because the way Superman has
been<00:00:54.809> handled<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> last<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.550> maybe

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
been handled in the last you know maybe

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
been handled in the last you know maybe
since<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> death<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.199> return<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.500> Superman

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
since the death and return of Superman

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.830 
since the death and return of Superman
which<00:00:58.980> i<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> last<00:01:00.539> good

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
which i think is one of the last good

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
which i think is one of the last good
storyline<00:01:01.230> Superman<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:01.949> has<00:01:02.219> had<00:01:02.489> in

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
way that the character himself is kind

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.950

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
be treated just fully and actually I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.510 
be treated just fully and actually I
think<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> lawsuit<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.310> too

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
think there was a lawsuit on this too

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.210 
think there was a lawsuit on this too
that<00:01:32.549> basically<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that basically I think it was one of the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.060 
that basically I think it was one of the
widow's<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.390> widows<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:38.009> of

underutilized<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.270> can't<00:01:48.689> remember<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.990> they

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
underutilized I can't remember if they

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.420 
underutilized I can't remember if they
won<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> couple<00:01:50.040> years<00:01:50.189> ago

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
won or not that was a couple years ago

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
won or not that was a couple years ago
but<00:01:50.640> basically<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> point<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:51.899> I'm

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
but basically the point of what I'm

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.539 
but basically the point of what I'm
saying<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> Superman<00:01:52.950> has<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.369> been

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
saying is that Superman has not been

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
saying is that Superman has not been
handled<00:01:53.850> well<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.149> he's<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.540> fan<00:01:54.810> favorite

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
handled well so he's not a fan favorite

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
best to be unbiased in this video I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.899 
best to be unbiased in this video I

character<00:02:27.299> over<00:02:27.540> another<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:28.019> because<00:02:28.080> I

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
character over another just because I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.440 
character over another just because I
like<00:02:28.560> one<00:02:28.769> better<00:02:28.950> my<00:02:29.579> last<00:02:29.760> video<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:30.090> did<00:02:30.120> was

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
like one better my last video I did was

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.369 
like one better my last video I did was
basically<00:02:30.690> Batman<00:02:31.409> vs.<00:02:32.329> Wolverine<00:02:33.329> and<00:02:33.870> even

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
basically Batman vs. Wolverine and even

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.410 
basically Batman vs. Wolverine and even
though<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.829> Batman<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.489> he's<00:02:35.819> my

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
though I like Batman I think he's my

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.580 
though I like Batman I think he's my
tease<00:02:36.599> my<00:02:36.780> favorite<00:02:37.110> character

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
tease my favorite character

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.289 
tease my favorite character
I<00:02:37.620> still<00:02:38.250> go<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.519> Wolverine<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.090> I

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
I still go with Wolverine because I

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.699 
I still go with Wolverine because I
think<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.720> makes<00:02:39.840> sense<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.230> Wolverine

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
think that it makes sense that Wolverine

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.699 
think that it makes sense that Wolverine
would<00:02:40.860> take<00:02:41.010> him<00:02:41.099> down<00:02:41.629> in<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.500> this

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
would take him down in this in this

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.650 
would take him down in this in this
matchup<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.489> also<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.090> unbiased<00:02:45.299> too

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
matchup I also have to be unbiased too

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.819 
matchup I also have to be unbiased too
because<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.019> had<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> pick<00:02:46.440> between<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.799> two

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
because if I had to pick between the two

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.559 
because if I had to pick between the two
I<00:02:46.980> would<00:02:47.190> favor<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> Hulk<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.239> think<00:02:48.420> he's<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
I would favor the Hulk I think he's a

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.690 
I would favor the Hulk I think he's a
better<00:02:49.260> character<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.799> think<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.160> well<00:02:50.489> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
better character I think he's well I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.400 
better character I think he's well I
shouldn't<00:02:51.090> say<00:02:51.150> better<00:02:51.420> character<00:02:51.780> he's<00:02:52.200> been

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
shouldn't say better character he's been

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.130 
shouldn't say better character he's been
handled<00:02:52.829> better<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.310> thus<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.329> like<00:02:54.989> him

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
handled better and thus I like him

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.940 
handled better and thus I like him
better<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.530> now

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
better right now

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.130 
better right now

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
who's gonna win well the thing with the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.830 
who's gonna win well the thing with the
Hulk<00:03:41.639> is<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.090> he's<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> rage<00:03:42.540> monster

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840

Hulk is is that he's a rage monster
basically<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:44.639> he<00:03:44.760> can't<00:03:45.030> fly<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.780> he's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
basically and he can't fly and he's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.089 
basically and he can't fly and he's
basically<00:03:47.840> pretty<00:03:48.840> close<00:03:49.079> pretty<00:03:49.739> damn<00:03:49.889> close

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
basically pretty close pretty damn close

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.520 
basically pretty close pretty damn close
to<00:03:50.160> invulnerable<00:03:50.970> Superman<00:03:51.629> is<00:03:51.870> all<00:03:52.139> of<00:03:52.349> that

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
to invulnerable Superman is all of that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.500 
to invulnerable Superman is all of that
as<00:03:52.680> well<00:03:52.919> plus<00:03:53.220> Superman<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.639> super<00:03:54.120> speed<00:03:54.359> the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
as well plus Superman a super speed the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.839 
as well plus Superman a super speed the
Hulk<00:03:54.720> has<00:03:54.870> increased<00:03:55.290> speed<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.340> don't

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
Hulk has increased speed but I don't

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.909 
Hulk has increased speed but I don't
think<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.239> put<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.510> Hulk<00:03:57.750> speed<00:03:58.139> you

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
think you can put the Hulk speed you

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.860 
think you can put the Hulk speed you
know<00:03:59.099> in<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.519> same<00:03:59.760> category<00:04:00.329> as<00:04:00.389> Superman

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
know in the same category as Superman

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.280 
know in the same category as Superman
speed<00:04:01.109> also<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.970> Hulk<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.389> can<00:04:03.720> leap<00:04:03.959> because

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
speed also the Hulk can can leap because

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.619 
speed also the Hulk can can leap because
he's<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.650> strong<00:04:04.919> Kent<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.489> leap<00:04:05.730> insane

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
he's so strong Kent can leap insane

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.610 
he's so strong Kent can leap insane
distances<00:04:07.199> but<00:04:07.859> Superman<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.790> fly<00:04:08.819> up<00:04:09.269> fly

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620

that<00:06:44.699> way<00:06:44.849> like<00:06:45.059> I<00:06:45.179> would<00:06:45.389> look<00:06:45.569> at<00:06:45.719> like

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:45.869 
that way like I would look at like

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:49.519 
that way like I would look at like
Batman<00:06:46.349> or<00:06:46.589> somebody<00:06:46.919> like<00:06:46.979> that<00:06:47.389> but<00:06:48.499> he's<00:06:49.499> a

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
Batman or somebody like that but he's a

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:50.509 
Batman or somebody like that but he's a
much<00:06:49.769> better<00:06:49.799> fighter<00:06:50.189> than<00:06:50.279> the<00:06:50.429> whole

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:50.519 
much better fighter than the whole

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:51.739 
much better fighter than the whole
that's<00:06:50.789> all<00:06:50.939> there<00:06:51.089> is<00:06:51.179> to<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.449> he's<00:06:51.569> much

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:51.749 
that's all there is to it he's much

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:54.289 
that's all there is to it he's much
better<00:06:51.929> fighter<00:06:52.259> and<00:06:52.559> he's<00:06:53.039> not<00:06:53.279> going<00:06:53.729> to<00:06:53.759> let

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:54.299 
better fighter and he's not going to let

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:55.729 
better fighter and he's not going to let
his<00:06:54.389> emotions<00:06:54.629> take<00:06:54.989> over<00:06:55.169> like<00:06:55.439> the<00:06:55.559> Hulk

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:55.739 
his emotions take over like the Hulk

00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:59.389 
his emotions take over like the Hulk
obviously<00:06:56.429> will<00:06:56.929> so<00:06:57.929> I<00:06:57.959> would<00:06:58.229> say<00:06:58.469> plus<00:06:59.219> the

00:06:59.389 --> 00:06:59.399 
obviously will so I would say plus the

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.350 
obviously will so I would say plus the
fact<00:06:59.610> that<00:06:59.669> you<00:06:59.759> can<00:06:59.909> fly<00:07:00.089> and<00:07:00.299> everything

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
fact that you can fly and everything

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.569 
fact that you can fly and everything
else<00:07:00.659> I<00:07:00.929> had<00:07:01.589> to<00:07:01.679> go<00:07:01.769> Superman<00:07:02.189> this<00:07:02.369> one

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:02.579 
else I had to go Superman this one

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:04.549 
else I had to go Superman this one
easily<00:07:02.849> I<00:07:03.209> think<00:07:03.269> he<00:07:03.509> easily<00:07:03.839> takes<00:07:04.169> this<00:07:04.319> one

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:04.559 
easily I think he easily takes this one

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.379 
easily I think he easily takes this one
and<00:07:04.799> I<00:07:05.099> think<00:07:05.159> that<00:07:05.489> people<00:07:05.639> actually<00:07:05.969> make

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
and I think that people actually make

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:07.969 
and I think that people actually make
this<00:07:06.569> one<00:07:06.779> closer<00:07:07.079> that<00:07:07.409> it<00:07:07.529> should<00:07:07.769> be

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
this one closer that it should be

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.100 
this one closer that it should be
because<00:07:08.849> they<00:07:09.059> don't<00:07:09.089> like<00:07:09.389> Superman<00:07:09.899> or

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
because they don't like Superman or

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.269 
because they don't like Superman or
because<00:07:10.409> they<00:07:10.589> love<00:07:10.769> the<00:07:10.919> Hulk<00:07:11.129> and

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:11.279 
because they love the Hulk and

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:13.999 
because they love the Hulk and
Superman's<00:07:11.699> kind<00:07:11.969> of<00:07:12.029> like<00:07:12.149> your<00:07:13.019> dad<00:07:13.229> or<00:07:13.259> your

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
Superman's kind of like your dad or your

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:15.529

grandpa's<00:07:14.459> favorite<00:07:14.669> character<00:07:15.389> your
