00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
doing some paper piercing using the stem

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.810 
doing some paper piercing using the stem
part<00:00:11.580> met<00:00:12.240> peg<00:00:12.570> whether<00:00:13.530> or<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.340> Pearson

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
part met peg whether or not the Pearson

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.960 
part met peg whether or not the Pearson
could<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.120> done<00:00:15.470> was<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:16.710> oval<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> circle

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
could be done was it an oval or a circle

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.990 
could be done was it an oval or a circle
shape<00:00:18.180> after<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.500> little<00:00:19.710> experimentation<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
shape after a little experimentation I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.439 
shape after a little experimentation I
whipped<00:00:21.480> up<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:24.090> takes<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
whipped up that is you can that takes a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
whipped up that is you can that takes a
little<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.810> patient<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.550> will<00:00:26.699> just

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
little bit of patient and I will just

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.000 
little bit of patient and I will just
give<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.539> short<00:00:27.840> demonstration<00:00:28.109> here

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
give it a very short demonstration here

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.849 
give it a very short demonstration here
this<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> first<00:00:30.330> time<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:31.109> filmed

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
this is the first time I have filmed

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.830 
this is the first time I have filmed
anything<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.669> please<00:00:32.880> bear<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.239> me<00:00:33.420> with

anything but please bear with me with

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.590 
anything but please bear with me with
the<00:00:33.989> shaky<00:00:34.380> shots<00:00:34.730> anyway<00:00:35.730> let's<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.180> started

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the shaky shots anyway let's get started

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.479 
the shaky shots anyway let's get started
first<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.890> take<00:00:38.520> care<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.780> line<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.489> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
first of all take care to line up the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.470 
first of all take care to line up the
edge<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.120> match<00:00:42.690> Peck<00:00:43.320> grid<00:00:44.450> with<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
edge of your match Peck grid with the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.139 
edge of your match Peck grid with the
edge<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.620> shape<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.760> wanting

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
edge of the shape that you are wanting

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
edge of the shape that you are wanting
to<00:00:48.329> pierce<00:00:48.570> around<00:00:49.309> then<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> simply<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to pierce around then it's simply a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.529 
to pierce around then it's simply a
measure<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.800> poking<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.010> hole<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:57.270> first

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
measure of poking a hole in the first

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
measure of poking a hole in the first
one<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:59.570> then<00:01:01.430> moving<00:01:02.430> very<00:01:02.850> carefully<00:01:04.700> go

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
one is so then moving very carefully go

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
one is so then moving very carefully go
to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.030> next<00:01:06.210> hole<00:01:09.439> keep<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.280> time<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to the next hole keep in at all time the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.440 
to the next hole keep in at all time the
line<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> grill<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.520> line<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> edge

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
line of the grill and line with the edge

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
line of the grill and line with the edge
of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> paper<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.799> finger<00:01:20.189> getting<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
of the paper use my finger getting in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
of the paper use my finger getting in
the<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:20.850> via<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:24.119> continue<00:01:24.570> around<00:01:24.659> your

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the way via and you continue around your

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.240 
the way via and you continue around your
shape<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:27.979> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.260 

all<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.180> around<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.730> see<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
all the way around and you will see I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.320 
all the way around and you will see I
remove<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.280> starting<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.030> go

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
remove this that we are starting to go

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.860 
remove this that we are starting to go
around<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.780> curve<00:01:40.460> you'll<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.610> lovely<00:01:42.300> even

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
around a curve you'll get lovely even

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.859 
around a curve you'll get lovely even
spacing<00:01:44.120> and<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.040> worthwhile

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
spacing and it is really worthwhile

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.570 
spacing and it is really worthwhile
because<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> end<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:50.400> can<00:01:50.550> achieve

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
because at the end of it you can achieve

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.960 
because at the end of it you can achieve
a<00:01:51.240> look<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> project<00:01:53.400> like<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:55.970> hope

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
a look on a project like that I hope

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.030 
a look on a project like that I hope
that's<00:01:57.150> been<00:01:57.390> helpful<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.740> look<00:01:59.010> forward

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that's been helpful and I look forward

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.800 
that's been helpful and I look forward
to<00:01:59.369> sharing<00:01:59.610> again<00:02:00.030> soon<00:02:00.360> thanks<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.470> looking
