person I just should go over the quick I

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.550 
person I just should go over the quick I
and<00:03:10.549> then<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.819> gotta<00:03:10.970> pick<00:03:11.239> what<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.019> want<00:03:12.170> I

and then you gotta pick what you want I
just<00:03:12.980> got<00:03:13.159> a<00:03:13.190> survival<00:03:13.790> mode<00:03:13.970> now<00:03:14.659> did<00:03:14.900> the

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
just got a survival mode now did the

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.410 
just got a survival mode now did the
zombies<00:03:15.440> because<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.730> think<00:03:16.909> this<00:03:17.030> on<00:03:17.209> these

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
zombies because I think this on these

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.280 
zombies because I think this on these
are<00:03:17.599> probably<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.370> easiest<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:20.140> then<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
are probably the easiest and then you

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.339 
are probably the easiest and then you
shoot<00:03:21.560> use<00:03:22.549> your<00:03:22.760> arrow<00:03:23.000> keys<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.329> move<00:03:25.000> and

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
shoot use your arrow keys to move and

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.410 
shoot use your arrow keys to move and
don't<00:03:27.349> get<00:03:27.530> caught<00:03:27.590> by<00:03:27.920> them<00:03:28.040> because<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.209> can

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
don't get caught by them because you can

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.360 
don't get caught by them because you can
done<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:32.540> should<00:03:32.870> drop<00:03:33.109> guns<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.950> stuff<00:03:34.129> I

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370
