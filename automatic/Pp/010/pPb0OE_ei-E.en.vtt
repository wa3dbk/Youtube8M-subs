00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.980
 welcome again at pay tv now 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.290
 we have something really unique 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.670
 for them they listen to a bit under 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.860
 This sounds a bit like me 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.059
 So to speak, I'm the robocop 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.790
 because I make quite strange noises 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.850
 and what that is you see in here already 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.830
 3d and never mirrored on the side 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.289
 that overwhelms me now times 3d 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.550
 this is our topic and now 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.660
 i can tell you a thing we can tell you 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.250
 take a camera now here 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.550
 my colleague stands this is real that is 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.570
 no 3d but it must be the birch trees and what 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.110
 we have here for you is easy 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.730
 unique similar 3d printer is the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.380
 ready for immediate use here we have 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.820
 now no complicated kit like 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.379
 somewhere else but it is one 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.270
 closed housing is certainly stable 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.399
 and it is especially easy times 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.149
 really high quality technology and what that 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.860
 good piece can 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.600
 I have to hand over the ball now 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.690
 to my colleagues because that is yes 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.370
 extremely 3d printer wants everything 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.809
 expressing in 3d where I say to it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.219
 I do not have to know right now 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.469
 really where to start 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.180
 because basically you can do almost anything 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.829
 expression with a 3d printer times 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.239
 apart from food and even 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.369
 that works for the very special 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.600
 day but that's a totally different 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.909
 history what you are here of course 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.830
 printing is what you can 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.119
 usually not so elsewhere 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.680
 can buy more than that can times 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.060
 An old gentleman knopp from your janker 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.740
 jacket, for example, if you are 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.390
 just do not get new then 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.619
 Do you just take the model here and 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 pressure system off again and works 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.490
 the colleague Anne always says she prints 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.500
 It's your own sales 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.180
 their fans for their high heels off that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.250
 Everything is possible or just asks 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.020
 for a a drawer in the kitchen 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.939
 a handle for example this 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740
 stories because it is as stable as 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.930
 actually almost like a normal one 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.090
 animal bones and that works by 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.710
 we just liquefy plastic 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.990
 the role is in the back and this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.119
 fine nozzles spray them in the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.490
 Three-dimensional area on the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.549
 real element on it you have 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.229
 the nose of it you smell something like that 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.700
 but you lost me to janker 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.000
 jacket so again I'm hamburger 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.979
 and before we put on a jacket freezes 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.840
 the hell to grow 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.880
 that's about as if I were to you 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.680
 as düsseldorfer as kölner say there was 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.409
 the slip of the tongue wilson old beer 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.480
 there is nothing but so in the case of 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.520
 paragraphs 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.690
 understood by that said okay and now 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.550
 Let's get to the important one 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.360
 point when they're my generation 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.230
 then I can remember it 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.460
 I was very proud of elementary school 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.840
 when I sort my donors like that 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.490
 I was not only allowed to somehow 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.510
 Classically, so the pencils 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.700
 had I had right 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.260
 Typewriter and I have mine 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.820
 colleagues here from the technology simple 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.710
 described as this good piece 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 Said were loud little tubes there 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.070
 you could clean the eraser and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.690
 so on and so forth I have 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.610
 trying to get on ebay that's 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.140
 not to me and then have the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 Guys here said wait a minute 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.220
 a little bit here came the same 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.660
 we have this for you and now 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.400
 I have that and I think that's great 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.720
 within a short time was next 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.950
 printed on it they see that it 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.780
 Of course, the four also distinguished 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.160
 Colored plastics gives for this 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.470
 device basically we deliver to you 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.060
 this printer use finished that is 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.620
 So he is here like he is here now 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.270
 we are at home with you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.790
 just plug it in at the socket 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.440
 and you can gas them if you like 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.670
 because now with a computer like us 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.780
 here with the laptop here 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.060
 for example, with the appropriate 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.860
 provide information or whether they are 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.209
 just the corresponding data from the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.910
 what you want to print here on the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.800
 included a gigabyte sd card 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.660
 pack and work the device self-sufficient 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.790
 let that be completely up to you 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.010
 but you can basically do anything with it 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.360
 This 3d printer will print what you need 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.100
 Of course, that too can happen 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.630
 sometimes for the handicraft area 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.310
 especially if the railway is too far 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.350
 you like to be a little house yours 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.120
 own or a very special car 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.010
 with special wing doors or whole 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.020
 special tree or whatever that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 is also everyday objects can be 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.500
 excellent print and why 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.260
 because it is fast and because of this 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.459
 Plastic is extremely stable and 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.450
 this is the highlight 759 euro 99 cents 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.220
 the price for it 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.360
 that alone is great because 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.190
 we here a non-binding 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.459
 Price recommendation of the manufacturer of 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.709
 So you have to save almost 1800 euros 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.380
 here almost 60 percent and that's right 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.850
 this is just the point and the gravel 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.500
 for example, if you design students now 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.630
 are if you are architecture students 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.730
 then this device definitely is 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.140
 because the classic cuts 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.080
 the little tree, for example, around 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.190
 the planned house come around it 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.359
 that's exactly the point so one 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.650
 friend of mine has at that time 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.880
 studied architecture and we have 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.590
 once laughed because he somehow 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.750
 with this classic race of the 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.190
 railroad like bosch imitating the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.380
 he would not have to do all he could now 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.090
 could just about his computer 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.660
 dine the good piece and it would 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.150
 come out 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.639
 look again at the price 759 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.590
 euro 91 for a full 3d printing 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.870
 we are not talking about the kit 58 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.250
 percent discount that is announce 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.630
 Price this is a fight price 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.080
 You need an order number for it 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.430
 that the pv 86 00 56 9 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.540
 and the ladies and gentlemen ours 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.310
 call centers also know for example 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.140
 they have so much to say 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.690
 i just do not pay installment 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.180
 is of course also possible here 01 80 51 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.620
 51 three times the two it's the number and 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.570
 Let 's have a look at some janka 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.040
 buttons for bavaria düsseldorfer colleagues 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.040
 from the huge
