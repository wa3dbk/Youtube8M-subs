00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.160
 ah 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.090
 or the boys if very good today I want 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 answer a question that has made me 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 a user in the survey if you remember 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.199
 the survey that I did about 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 a month ago to be able to improve the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 videos and everything I do in the channel does not 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.470
 so I asked you a few questions 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.809
 If you have not answered, you can do it 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.120
 because it 's link in the description of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.059
 this video but hey there was a question 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 what I did in good plan to see what happens and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.809
 the question was the next one that I 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 I would say if you see me in the supermarket 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.789
 coincidence and I did not expect a big 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 answers but many of the answers 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.579
 they make a lot of sense and in a few 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.770
 videos I would like to be able to answer 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 many of those questions so after 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 of this then leave in the comments if 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.680
 you are interested if you want me to continue with 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.140
 these videos responding to these 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.200
 questions from totally anonymous people 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 because the survey is totally anonymous 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.759
 answer the survey questions 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.430
 is down in the description forget 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.620
 good 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.640
 then the question you want 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.310
 answer today is the following is that what 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.240
 I have here targeted 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.920
 It's also worth one of the first 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.960
 juliÃ¡n how can I give value to my 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 work 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.060
 and how can I believe more in myself 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.689
 Well the truth is that it is a question 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.670
 what have I done myself too long ago and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.689
 I would have liked someone to do 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 a video like the one I'm doing 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.009
 now because there is no information 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.810
 this and only those who have passed 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.579
 for all this and in the end have found 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.130
 the answer but they do not share it 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.350
 well it's super interesting first let's go 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.860
 to the first part of the question how 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.860
 give you value 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 the value of our work 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.810
 comes for the quality of it but the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.690
 quality I 'm not talking simply about 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.239
 the color correction of the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.790
 entity of the super objective that we use or 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.620
 the camera model this talking about 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.709
 the capacity of our photos 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.860
 to create sensation in the key to 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.530
 create feelings and some and to carry 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.470
 some kind of message not think 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.299
 the more photos we do the more 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 we practice if we reflect on the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.019
 theme we will learn over time to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.000
 express ourselves through photography 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.610
 we will learn to say vale 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.320
 something romantic and very fun like 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.420
 I get one with a photograph 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.190
 so with this frame with these colors 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.200
 with this focus and such with this day 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.940
 Forge with this objective over time 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.400
 you will learn to do something nostalgic 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.970
 something sad, well, that 's another objective 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.470
 I use another exposure even if you're in the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.300
 same situation but you can use another 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.360
 exhibition to create another kind of 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.580
 feelings that when you start to 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.560
 control all this people are going to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.600
 start feeling certain emotions 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.420
 when they see your photos and automatically 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.989
 this is what gives them the value of 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.430
 agreement this is my opinion does not have 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.940
 what is the most correct thing in the world but 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 is what I think the value of the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.890
 photos comes with the influence they have 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.250
 themselves to cause 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.250
 feelings or sensations and then like 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.770
 believe in me 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.930
 it 's okay that you see is two 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.570
 questions at once because it is that they are 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.000
 very related if you comply with what 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.190
 first I told you automatically 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.050
 people will start to tell you hey uncle 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.110
 love your photos is that they transmit 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.240
 something and I like how you express yourself with the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.209
 photography does not and when people start 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.550
 to tell you this you start to believe it is 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.810
 very wrong to start believing credit 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.940
 before the people of the univa 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.860
 It is also very wrong to believe that everything 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.080
 that people tell you but the best is 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.540
 find a balance when people 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.739
 start to value your photos value 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.840
 comes from giving value to these photos of 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.850
 agreement, it's not just you who give 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.180
 value but you cause the 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.400
 people give them the necessary value not 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.320
 I understand why the neighbor has decided 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.040
 right now 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.750
 change the layout of your furniture 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.330
 while I record the good video let's continue 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.330
 the client or the one who sees the photo is the one 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.950
 gives you the value in many of the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.620
 situations like there are many theories of 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.770
 This is what I think but then to 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.110
 that you can believe that people will start 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.880
 to give you opinions people will start 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.190
 say things start talking to him in time 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.110
 start to tell you hey I've seen your photos 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.220
 and they are a pass with time 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.430
 you will get 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.530
 impress different types of people 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.350
 and listening to that will motivate you and 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.350
 this will make you start 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.590
 Believe in your abilities in your 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.940
 capabilities of being a photographer 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.820
 express yourself through photography 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.480
 you will start to know how to feel it 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.950
 but but as important as in each 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.920
 thing related to photography is 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.990
 take pictures if you are at home reading 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.730
 forums or just watching my videos me 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.289
 love that you see my videos many 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.409
 thanks for that 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.559
 but if that's where your development comes 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.080
 photographic mauves you have to go out and 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.449
 you have to start taking pictures this is 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.460
 super important if you take pictures by 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.399
 at least once a week go out and 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.680
 take photos photos photos and not just 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.939
 shoot but think about what it is that 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.499
 you did well last week what is 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.809
 what you did wrong last week 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:46.509
 how can you improve it this week or this 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:49.210
 day this is what you're going to improve the 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.710
 improve the value of your photos will go up 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.949
 when uploading the value of your photos 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.689
 automatically you will start to believe in 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.219
 yourself because the people who smelled 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.990
 I hope that with this I could have 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.479
 respond not only to the person who has 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.819
 asked this question I do not know who is 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.709
 but it's that idea not knowing who he is and 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.270
 also many more because I 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:09.069
 personally yes I did this 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.629
 question a long time ago of 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.430
 agreement 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.399

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.520

 keep responding I'll do 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.039
 to questions from this series of people 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.949

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.740
 the questionnaire and I invite you again to

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.669
 will help improve my videos 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.349
 there are questions of type you seem very 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.150
 long ones that seem very short of what 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.650
 you want me to talk more and now all this 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.349
