00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.580
 how about brewers ready to follow 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.680
 talking about beer today we're going to 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.770
 talk about water water for 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.960
 make our beer in theory all 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.450
 we know that water is a liquid that does not 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.419
 It does not smell or taste, but the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.689
 reality if you have them we know what 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:24.169
 We have tried the water of the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.419
 faucet that a purified water and if you live 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.120
 in Mexico you will not let me lie that 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.680
 you can not drink tap water 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.050
 the water must have certain 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.510
 features to be able to be used 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 in beer Now if someone 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.450
 ask what brand I'm going to use to 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.270
 brewing beer I'm going to tell you that 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.820
 is the one that you most like the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.489
 water has certain composition is composed 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.530
 of mineral salts and those salts 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.050
 minerals will help us to elaborate 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.149
 beer 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.129
 depending on the mineral rooms that 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.170
 contain your water are the characteristics 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.740
 of the flavor you're going to get in the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.920
 beer 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.110
 that's why I tell them that when they use the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 water be one that you like 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.270
 they will find parameters like 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.090
 alkalinity and hardness in the water but that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.230
 can see it thoroughly in an analysis 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 physicist can ask your 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.700
 water provider if they are going to a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.240
 local purifier where they fill the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.120
 for a certain amount of money or also 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770
 see it on the label of your water can 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.110
 contact the provider directly and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 that will help us a lot to predict the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.400
 characteristics that will get the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.190
 beer although well we're going to see that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
 already specifically when we started 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.990
 understand a little more about chemistry 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.350
 Now we are more interested in knowing what is it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.910
 that water contains water too 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.119
 You may find that you have certain 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.910
 microorganisms but in boiling it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.770
 they will kill well do not have pending 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.960
 that someone asked me out there too 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.869
 that if the well water serves if it is 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.910
 well water you take it and have 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.240
 seen that nothing has ever happened to 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.430
 no one 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.990
 forward you can use it from all 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.149
 boiling modes are going to kill 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.860
 certain type of microorganisms and it's not 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.440
 that everyone and we are going to avoid too 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.420
 Too much to use chlorine a lot of people 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.040
 wants to purify the water by adding chlorine 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.620
 to make the color look does not work 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.959
 for nothing, take very good account 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 it was something very simple I hope it is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.800
 of utility remember that I am the backup 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.760
 to that the beer unites us we see ourselves in 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.760
