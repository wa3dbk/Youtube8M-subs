 but I wanted to make a special video 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.540

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.490
 slow totally shameless is fine 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.500

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.650

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.400
 ok is that you have a gift of destruction 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.610
 tell your mother they will see when you 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.720
 tell your mother and well let's go and a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.680
 a little bit faster because what I'm 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.390
 seeing that in the end all 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.799
 they're going to be like that talking and all this and I 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.900
 I'd love to try to get to a game 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.340
 at the end and good as saying means 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.269
 I hope you support that they leave four 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.680
 comments to know what has 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.909
 seemed like the game before fun is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.620
 liking the video if you're not liking 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.030
 although equally the video has just 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.920
 start but I'm going to try to do it 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
 as best as you can already know that this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.450
 gameplay months and I'm not 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.639
 exaggerating worth many months ago 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.139
 that I do not bring this game mode and I think 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.849
 that I'm going to die is worth it because I've lost 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.109
 a little practice but I'm going to 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.000
 try as I am doing do it what 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.469
 better than I can and good if you go how 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.670
 how are you I really wanted to 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.650
 play this game mode and want 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.329
 tell you one thing is fermin said of the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.010
 variety and I'll tell you in your good bed 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.939
 go to your women to their things that in your 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.939
 bed is my name 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.969
 very good but you are learning me the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.560
 things are very good then it's normal that 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.299
 I asked dissipated something happens to you because 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.299
 nothing is like that because it is that you padros 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.350
 fermin 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.850
 I love you so much 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.100
 you are big big 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.480
 to see fermín let's take things with 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.400
 a little bit more calm because I'm 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.710
 seeing that they are a little bit altered and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.180
 that I really do not like is that I'm 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.010
 starting to believe that these games is not 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.050
 a game for children and managers because 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.960
 well basically because fermin is a 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.490
 murderer kills people or is the killer is 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.710
 super violent 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.000
 and even having spoken the game I 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.470
 I take your map for example win the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.030
 good departure the map from before 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.000
 map of the heavens and it takes me to 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.650
 hell then it's worth after having me 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.370
 killed in and I have not been called to the era 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.200
 good of eden of the assisted pious and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.460
 it has taken me to the most complicated map 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.260
 because well you know that for this 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.720
 map is very very very but that very 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.690
 complicated voucher is quite difficult to 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.240
 win I have only won two or three 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.100
 sometimes I think super little because it's pretty 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.750
 complicated but good as it is already 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.600
 saying I'm going to try to play this 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.280
 map the best I can is perfect perfect 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 I'll stay here firm you can a 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.550
 bit slow if you want you can 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.540
 wait 12 junkets for what is more 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.820
 direct 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.590
 you can already already have a lot of perfect 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.450
 thanks for migration action has been 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.760
 had a love worth has been completely 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.940
 a ball and good to see we are going to go 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:32.490
 here with garlic under garlic 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.660
 - more less more than sharp out because it is 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.910
 if not 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.270
 do not let us write this complicated 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.270
 magno 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.760
 a real boy arrives at the end has 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.710
 dead dead all good fermin is the 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.180
 last game is worth trying 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.740
 Well right now it's very slow now 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.230
 you could go the whole game good I'm going to 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.520
 try to win the last game I hope 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.110
 that you liked all the games 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.760
 that you detracted tried to make the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.710
 best way in the most comical way 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.270
 possible already you know that to me then sometimes 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.470
 the attempt was a little head 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.410
 make the videos so the most fun 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.180
 What can I do but, well then, total 20? 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.919
 crazy too that take advantage of logics for 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.150
 say if I'm new to the channel and good 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.620
 I'm watching this video by pure 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.600
 surprise because to dollars that copied 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.340
 by good makeup I invite you who's worth 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.919
 trace to the channel is to see two more 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.300
 videos like this style you already know that 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.410
 I had a little break in the channel 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.610
 in which you have not been uploading video 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.080
 because I already said and now explain the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.510
 reason and the quad was because it was wrong or 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.860
 I was sick is wrong with vomiting and 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.270
 a theory yes a little bit so if so 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.220
 no but I'm already starting to find 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.600
 Now look at being good off Alava 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.820
 is starting to find a lot better 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.500
 so, well, I invite you, it's worth all the 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.880
 people that good that they have wanted that 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.169
 also disappeared on youtube or 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.389
 something because I was receiving so many 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.220
 plan and pop messages that has happened to you 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.229
 disappeared from youtube and the truth is 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.720
 I do not have no thought of leaving 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.940
 of youtube at the moment that is 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.130
 path so long is not so easy to 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.230
 leave it or it is a very long way 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.510
 traveled with all of you as to 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.550
 leave youtube that is to me so 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.740
 least I have a lot very much left 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.630
 life time still here on youtube 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.040
 while all of you I'm going to fit in and 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.410
 Someone who wants to follow me 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.720
 listening to my nonsense and me and my 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.010
 idiots and my day to day because I'm going to 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.900
 continue to be here uploading videos 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.880
 Even if only one person listens to me, it's worth 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.070
 so I think you 're having me 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.570
 a very good game let's see if 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.850
 we can finish the game in the way 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.040
 more epic possible is worth somehow 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.320
 it's clear we have to finish one of a 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.720
 epic way you stay including with the 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.530
 background project and nothing has been a 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.980
 epic game has been a game of 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:48.280
 happiness 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:48.280
 so they have water talking about what it is 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:58.050
 we left the next 70 trying 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.050
 from the neck goodbye
