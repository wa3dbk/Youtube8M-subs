00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 the chippie they still come 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.210
 lily was often in a different hippie suit 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.619
 the fight 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 spain you australia 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.009
 had something favorable can have a strong 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.170
 South African South American country and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.280
 the world champion and australia's now 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 it will be celebrating 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.250
 Spain has something more in the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 as as the Netherlands so I crawled up 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 the corpse spudgy but we danny that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.480
 had 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.660
 yes, people start calling again 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.370
 oh oh oh shoot in the spots we 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 have to weigh spain yes we have to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.059
 Spain 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.820
 bram is right but we also play the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.039
 gilia against australia so if you have that now 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.989
 maintenance then do not have to go 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.430
 lucy that head as she's the the surprising 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.610
 being old it becomes a bit Belgian 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.890
 south america young back very heeled 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.240
 talented somewhat difficult against chili 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.369
 we don't get easy we will ball 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.460
 but we don't get it easily 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.460
 William van de Kerkhof who thinks we are 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.220
 chile or afraid to australia 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.430
 is that you do of the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.740
 graveyard and tess of a nice pool 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.530
 pool is easy and i can do a lot 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.869
 better that you say blue 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.479
 but spain are nice pool and therefore one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.040
 easy prey and a spain and 2 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.970
 netherlands center ready 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 the number 2 from our poll bram 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770
 that game against the number 1 of the pool 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.630
 from Brazil in the eighth finals 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.130
 actual Brazil becomes number one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.810
 actually you also need spain among you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 let everything be right against that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.869
 that host country brazil that is it 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.610
 annoying from the draw that you 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.020
 probably big economy against 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 Brazil must go to in the second round 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.969
 are you hopeless? 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.259
 and eventually you're not in good 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.579
 so box actually ended up in it 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.590
 a tournament so box 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.939
 you are going to erase the first against spain and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 then you come across protection 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.039
 brazil so just go for it 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.259
 it can hans come on it can you come 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.120
 here to ask my opinion and you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.390
 are you OK 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.099
 no to say that the world champion 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 brand think we will become world champions 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.650
 and on stick for nothing and they are not
