00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
 well, here I have an iphone 5 s 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.980
 good because it has no battery 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.780
 came with this battery because that is the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.970
 original battery but it does not work for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 nothing and the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.090
 try to turn it on with a battery 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.590
 china of these 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.410
 of 3.7 volts and 2800 thousand but now and 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.900
 let's see what happens well I'm just going 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.840
 to check that the side is the earth with 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.760
 Multimeter support in measurement mode 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.920
 of continuity 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.620
 I know that this side is the positive in the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.280
 end of this side down the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:52.559
 plate then I imagine that the end 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.559
 it will be the earth we are going to look for it 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.170
 actively has continuity with the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.230
 metallic part of that part where the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.360
 sim card then for sure that's the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.820
 ground as the terminals are very 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.640
 small ones I put some alligators to the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.860
 battery and this one that I have like earth what 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.910
 I'm going to connect instead of the pin that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.090
 it's there I'm going to connect it directly 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.860
 on the metal plate that covers the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.630
 contact of the sim 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 and then the other 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 I will try to accommodate here 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.890
 now I'm going to press the button 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.890
 on and let's see if it turns on 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.270
 and if it actually turns on 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.680
 and it seems that you have to make a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.170
 restoration because 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.580
 I probably had some problem before 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 that I brought to him and good 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.920
 let's see then what we can do 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.210
 for good now I will try to adapt the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.210
 Chinese battery that I have here 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:07.360
 then to the original terminals of the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.630
 battery iphone 5 iphone 5 s 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.150
 sorry and good if you notice it then 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.530
 they are a little strange terminals and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.000
 very small to weld the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.220
 directly then what I will do is going to 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.220
 be cut the flexible 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.680
 and from there then draw the two lines that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.030
 they are going to go to the battery but I already have 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.990
 adapted in a very professional way 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.470
 the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.620
 the iphone 5 s battery connector 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 so I'm going to bring the iphone I'm going to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 check that it works 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.250
 and there it is 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.500
 I hope the connection is correct if not 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.500
 then I will have lost an iphone 5 s 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.390
 very well turn on 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.220
 it's funny that I turn on I did not believe 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.980
 that it was so easy to adapt a battery 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.190
 china to a clear iphone is that it is 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 too cumbersome to have the battery 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.170
 here but at least I can do it 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.170
 turn on
