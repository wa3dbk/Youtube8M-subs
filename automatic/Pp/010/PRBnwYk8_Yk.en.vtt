four stroke outboard x' have become by

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.160 
four stroke outboard x' have become by
far<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.429> most<00:00:08.550> popular<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.240> market<00:00:09.330> but

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
far the most popular on the market but

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.570 
far the most popular on the market but
there<00:00:10.349> are<00:00:10.410> some<00:00:10.530> differences<00:00:11.010> between<00:00:11.070> four

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
there are some differences between four

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.629 
there are some differences between four
strokes<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.120> two<00:00:12.450> strokes<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.799> those<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
strokes and two strokes one of those is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.160 
strokes and two strokes one of those is
winterizing<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.570> there's<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> lot<00:00:16.080> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
winterizing and there's a lot of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.510 
winterizing and there's a lot of
confusion<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> properly

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
confusion about how to properly

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
confusion about how to properly
winterize<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.060> fourth<00:00:18.390> stroke<00:00:18.600> let's<00:00:19.320> end<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
winterize a fourth stroke let's end it

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.599 
winterize a fourth stroke let's end it
right<00:00:20.220> now

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
right now

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.849 
right now
the<00:00:21.600> first<00:00:21.840> thing<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.140> need<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.830> course

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the first thing you need to do of course

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.429 
the first thing you need to do of course
is<00:00:23.400> give<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> motor<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.539> good<00:00:24.869> freshwater

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
is give the motor a good freshwater

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470 
is give the motor a good freshwater
flush<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:26.849> cases<00:00:27.090> you'll<00:00:27.330> need<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
flush now in some cases you'll need a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.929 
flush now in some cases you'll need a
pair<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> ear<00:00:27.900> muffs<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.349> some<00:00:29.340> others<00:00:29.640> you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
pair of ear muffs and some others you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.620 
pair of ear muffs and some others you
can<00:00:30.090> thread<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> hose<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:32.510> let<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
can thread the hose right in and let the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
can thread the hose right in and let the
water<00:00:33.750> flow<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> good<00:00:34.500> five<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:34.710> ten

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
water flow for a good five or ten

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.569 
water flow for a good five or ten
minutes<00:00:36.649> now<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.860> she's<00:00:38.010> flushed<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.399> we're

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
minutes now that she's flushed out we're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
minutes now that she's flushed out we're
going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> remove<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> Cal<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.739> we're<00:00:40.890> going

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
going to remove the Cal and we're going

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.869 
going to remove the Cal and we're going
to<00:00:41.100> search<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.760> any<00:00:42.329> salt<00:00:42.719> buildup<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to search for any salt buildup that we

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.830 
to search for any salt buildup that we
can<00:00:45.030> find<00:00:45.329> inside<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.250> rinse<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.430> away<00:00:47.840> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
can find inside and rinse it away the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
can find inside and rinse it away the
next<00:00:49.140> step<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> change<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> lower<00:00:50.460> unit

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
next step is to change the lower unit

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
next step is to change the lower unit

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
oil now even if it's fresh you still

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
oil now even if it's fresh you still
want<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> change<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.579> case<00:00:53.610> any<00:00:53.969> water

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
want to change it just in case any water

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
want to change it just in case any water
got<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.870> course<00:00:55.140> water<00:00:55.469> freezes<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
got in there of course water freezes it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.740 
got in there of course water freezes it
expands<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.910> freezes<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.600> can

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
expands when it freezes and that can

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
expands when it freezes and that can
cause<00:00:57.870> serious<00:00:58.170> damage<00:00:58.770> watch<00:00:59.430> our<00:00:59.640> boats

through<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> motor<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> very

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
through the motor now this is very

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
through the motor now this is very
important<00:01:23.400> afterwards<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.570> need<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> tilt<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
important afterwards you need to tilt it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340 
important afterwards you need to tilt it
all<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.570> down<00:01:27.600> you

all the way up and all the way down you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
all the way up and all the way down you
want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> make<00:01:28.619> absolutely<00:01:29.430> sure<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.820> every

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
want to make absolutely sure that every

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
want to make absolutely sure that every

many tech heads myself included believe
that<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> four-stroke<00:01:52.979> motor<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.520> best

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that with a four-stroke motor the best

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
that with a four-stroke motor the best
way<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.060> winterize<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.079> simply<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> use<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
way to winterize it is simply to use it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.850 
way to winterize it is simply to use it
if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.180> start<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.719> motor<00:01:57.990> every<00:01:58.530> three

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
if you start your motor every three

if you start your motor every three
weeks<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.509> need<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> fog
