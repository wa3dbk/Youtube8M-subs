00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 then first of all you must have 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.850
 these green bananas that you can't 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 eating raw is that they make wines and bad 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.039
 in the belly and even die 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.900
 then they are very hard and they are not either 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.539
 good to eat this would be the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.520
 banana cheat male instead of banana 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.719
 that we eat normal and the band there 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.270
 female 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 however you have to cut them you cut of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.700
 followed by the part there is a kind of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.629
 spike that you can no longer peel 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 but it is more easily because it also peels 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.629
 it is not easy then it also puts the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 lemon all in the day otherwise 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.640
 become black that is classic ass 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.460
 which makes the banana because it contains 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:04.129
 potassium potassium oxidizes immediately a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 contact with oxygen is enough for 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.909
 see if hot oil needs to be made 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.200
 afraid of the spoon frying spoon 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:19.130
 if it makes bubbles it means that hot a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.439
 next place we cook bananas 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.439
 as they are cut 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 watch over at the moment 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.509
 ok take out the dna pot cook them 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.650
 a little because in the next step 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.380
 they must be quite soft 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.380
 be crushed with a special one 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.390
 automatic spiker that now you 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.390
 we will explain in detail 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.050
 Now 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.739
 ok now we will prepare the bananas there 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.090
 we will crush with this practical 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:03:00.200
 accessory called schiaccia bananas 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:04.370
 allow them to break all but crushed but 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.269
 come to come this looks like apple 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.580
 banana year above if the back of the 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.700
 banana the side and then comes overalls 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.739
 crush so very beautiful 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.739
 now you have to fry them 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:46.370
 now they will be going to fry these 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.370
 these banana balls and they will come 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.370
 extremely crisp 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.520
 put your finger inside normal did 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.670
 see a mythbuster that doesn't happen 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.670
 anything 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.410
 here now we are going to remove the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:19.120
 oil fritters and we will get these 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.770
 magic sim pancakes and banana banana 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.540
 and just above we will go to put some salt 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.070
 because the banana fritters do 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.070
 they eat little salt 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.840
 here this is a vegan dish us friends 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.389
 we can become vegan 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.770
 solissimi to with liver problems 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:05:02.330
 i eat dagan stuff because of banana e 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:06.310
 vegan and oil and salt ato3 vega 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.310
 let's start immediately with the tasting 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:31.419
 to every banana they have nothing 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.699
 obviously nothing then 7 if you want 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:39.310
 eat you eat stephen of these 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:47.409
 things and they asked you if fruit is that is 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:54.310
 you would never say banal but rather not abuse 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:06:03.610
 of nothing there was a cup of resta 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:05.770
 potato chips can be made if because the 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:11.069
 vega people did not eat these things 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.069
 framework a good comment 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:27.680
 then friends don't take the next one 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:33.910
 vegan recipe fried fish not me 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.910
 I remember more, though, like that 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:48.990
 if it takes now for home burns kind of 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.990
 mayonnaise and spicy 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:13.680
 I 'm focused I'm focused I don't know 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:26.339
 the review is only at home then not 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.339
 I could see if I focused no 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:37.379
 and I the seventh day that the banana 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:37.379
 fried 

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:45.759
 seems like a little bit to me now if you do 

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:50.649
 they asked what fruit you will say 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:54.520

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:57.689
