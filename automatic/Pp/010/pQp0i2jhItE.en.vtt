not<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.530> easy<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.980> convert<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.059> format

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
not that easy to convert from one format

not that easy to convert from one format
to<00:00:51.660> another<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:53.210> like<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.420> any<00:00:54.570> conversion

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
information it's just the nature of the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.619 
information it's just the nature of the
game<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:00.960> part<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:03.480> know

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
game for the most part and you know

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.850 
game for the most part and you know
we're<00:01:04.500> still<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.369> new<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.409> zoom<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
we're still very much new in the zoom is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
we're still very much new in the zoom is
no<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.600> over<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:09.810> things<00:01:10.290> should<00:01:10.560> improve

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
no so over time things should improve

no so over time things should improve
but<00:01:11.270> there<00:01:12.270> should<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> workaround<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.409> let

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
but there should be a workaround so let

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
that very simple and for some reason

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.229 
that very simple and for some reason
even<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:11.660> very<00:02:11.900> simple<00:02:12.290> format<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:13.400> not

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
even that very simple format is not

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.949 
even that very simple format is not
consistent<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:16.099> what<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:17.540> are<00:02:17.599> we<00:02:17.690> supposed

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
consistent so what what are we supposed

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.570 
consistent so what what are we supposed
to<00:02:18.080> do<00:02:18.230> how<00:02:18.470> how<00:02:18.769> are<00:02:18.890> we<00:02:19.010> supposed<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.370> work

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
to do how how are we supposed to work

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.530 
to do how how are we supposed to work
with<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:22.069> were<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.280> create<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
with this if you were to create the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.210 
with this if you were to create the
power<00:02:23.750> points<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.349> your<00:02:24.379> zoom<00:02:24.739> you're

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
power points on your zoom you're

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
power points on your zoom you're
actually<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.910> quite<00:02:26.209> luck<00:02:26.420> because<00:02:26.630> since<00:02:26.989> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
actually in quite luck because since you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.960 
actually in quite luck because since you
create<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.470> there<00:02:27.650> there's<00:02:28.160> no<00:02:28.310> conversion

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
create it there there's no conversion

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.960 
create it there there's no conversion
and<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.269> just<00:02:29.450> works<00:02:30.489> however<00:02:31.489> if<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.790> were<00:02:31.849> to

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
and it just works however if you were to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
and it just works however if you were to
create<00:02:32.180> them<00:02:32.360> off<00:02:32.540> site<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.079> load<00:02:33.290> them

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
create them off site and then load them

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.800 
create them off site and then load them
in<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.130> want<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> quick<00:02:34.640> meeting<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.269> you

probably<00:02:37.730> by<00:02:37.910> how<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.239> presents<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.120> thought

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
probably by how it presents so I thought

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.970 
probably by how it presents so I thought
okay<00:02:41.480> well<00:02:41.690> maybe<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.140> convert<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.739> into<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
okay well maybe we can convert it into a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.940 
okay well maybe we can convert it into a
PDF<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:43.730> view<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.049> PDF<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.739> that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
PDF and then view it on a PDF and that

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.650 
PDF and then view it on a PDF and that
works<00:02:46.190> fairly<00:02:46.459> well<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:46.790> there's<00:02:47.209> no<00:02:47.360> full

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
works fairly well but there's no full

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.330 
works fairly well but there's no full
screen<00:02:47.930> PDF<00:02:48.319> viewer<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.769> found<00:02:49.069> any

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
screen PDF viewer that I found any

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.369 
screen PDF viewer that I found any
viewers<00:02:50.329> out<00:02:50.510> there<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.900> know<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.200> one

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
viewers out there that know of one

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.229 
viewers out there that know of one
please<00:02:51.799> up<00:02:52.099> pass<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.700> because<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.090> would

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
please up pass it on because that would

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.110 
please up pass it on because that would
be<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> great<00:02:53.720> solution<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:55.280> we<00:02:55.819> can<00:02:56.000> then

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
be a great solution and we can then

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.020 
be a great solution and we can then
start<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:56.599> using<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.930> PDF<00:02:57.319> viewer<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.100> pop<00:02:59.000> it

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
start just using a PDF viewer and pop it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.789 
start just using a PDF viewer and pop it
in<00:02:59.269> full<00:02:59.450> screen<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.989> then<00:03:00.049> go<00:03:00.230> from<00:03:00.410> slide<00:03:00.769> to

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
in full screen and then go from slide to

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.170 
in full screen and then go from slide to
slide<00:03:01.989> but<00:03:02.989> my<00:03:03.139> solution<00:03:03.680> actually<00:03:04.340> goes<00:03:04.850> even

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
slide but my solution actually goes even

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.780 
slide but my solution actually goes even
a<00:03:05.420> little<00:03:06.260> bit<00:03:06.410> more<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:06.950> extreme<00:03:07.519> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
a little bit more to the extreme and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.410 
a little bit more to the extreme and
there's<00:03:08.690> basically<00:03:08.900> an<00:03:09.350> option<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:10.609> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
there's basically an option in a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.780 
there's basically an option in a
PowerPoint<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.950> lot<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.340> your<00:03:13.609> readers

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
PowerPoint and in a lot of your readers

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.020 
PowerPoint and in a lot of your readers
and<00:03:14.150> I'll<00:03:14.269> pull<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.319> pull<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:16.100> plug<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
and I'll pull it pull the plug the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.680 
and I'll pull it pull the plug the
computer<00:03:17.209> back<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.489> if<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.579> go

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:33.540 

to<00:03:25.690> file<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:31.360> can<00:03:31.569> save<00:03:32.020> as<00:03:32.350> pictures<00:03:32.890> what

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
to file you can save as pictures what

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.160 
to file you can save as pictures what
does<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:37.270> turns<00:03:37.510> every<00:03:37.870> single

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
does that do that turns every single

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.060 
does that do that turns every single
slide<00:03:38.410> into<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.800> picture<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.490> you<00:03:40.300> know<00:03:40.420> what

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
slide into a picture and you know what

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.910 
slide into a picture and you know what
you<00:03:42.070> happen<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.520> have<00:03:42.670> an<00:03:43.770> application<00:03:44.770> on

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
you happen to have an application on

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.820 
you happen to have an application on
your<00:03:45.010> zoom<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.480> can<00:03:46.660> view<00:03:46.870> pictures<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.500> full

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
your zoom that can view pictures in full

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.160 
your zoom that can view pictures in full
screen<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:49.720> exactly<00:03:49.990> what<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.350> did<00:03:52.170> so

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
screen so that is exactly what I did so

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.530 
screen so that is exactly what I did so
if<00:03:53.290> we<00:03:53.410> go<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.620> gallery<00:03:54.550> I'm<00:03:54.880> gonna<00:03:55.060> blur<00:03:55.300> the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
if we go to gallery I'm gonna blur the

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.750 
if we go to gallery I'm gonna blur the
screen<00:03:56.230> just<00:03:56.260> slightly<00:03:56.770> because<00:03:57.070> I<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.459> some

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
screen just slightly because I have some

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.330 
screen just slightly because I have some
private<00:03:58.420> photos<00:03:58.780> here<00:03:59.020> are<00:03:59.590> actually<00:03:59.860> it

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
private photos here are actually it

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.780 
private photos here are actually it
loads<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:00.940> actually<00:04:01.450> loaded<00:04:02.370> directly<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.670> my

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
loads it actually loaded directly to my

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.720 
loads it actually loaded directly to my
powerpoint<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.410> see<00:04:05.620> oh<00:04:05.800> here's<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.850> slide

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
powerpoint you can see oh here's a slide

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.400 
powerpoint you can see oh here's a slide
now<00:04:09.730> it's<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.180> backwards<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.260> can

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
now it's in backwards because you can

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.860 
now it's in backwards because you can
think<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.739> as<00:04:11.830> you're<00:04:11.980> taking<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.430> camera

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
think of it as you're taking a camera

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.440 
think of it as you're taking a camera
you're<00:04:13.870> taking<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.680> with<00:04:15.580> respect<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.359> the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
you're taking it with respect so the

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.509 
you're taking it with respect so the
last<00:04:16.690> picture<00:04:16.930> taken<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.680> Lex<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.310> last

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
last picture taken so the Lex the last

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.230 
last picture taken so the Lex the last
slide<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.269> now<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:19.989> first<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:21.150> there's<00:04:22.150> a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
slide is now the first and there's a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.670 
slide is now the first and there's a
workaround<00:04:22.600> for<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:23.050> too<00:04:23.919> but<00:04:24.480> as<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:26.560> can

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
workaround for that too but as you can

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.940 
workaround for that too but as you can
see<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:28.120> slides<00:04:28.390> render<00:04:28.810> perfectly<00:04:29.350> they

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
see the slides render perfectly they

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.540 
see the slides render perfectly they
load<00:04:30.220> fast<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.780> can<00:04:31.930> swipe<00:04:32.169> through<00:04:32.550> very

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
load fast and you can swipe through very

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.719 
load fast and you can swipe through very
very<00:04:33.910> cool<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.750> pictures<00:04:35.169> load<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:36.430> can

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
very cool the pictures load and you can

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.540 
very cool the pictures load and you can
now<00:04:36.850> deliver<00:04:37.410> powerpoint<00:04:38.410> on<00:04:38.620> your<00:04:39.310> zoom

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
now deliver powerpoint on your zoom

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.400 
now deliver powerpoint on your zoom
without<00:04:40.240> worrying<00:04:40.630> about<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.990> format

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
without worrying about the format

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.590 
without worrying about the format
because<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:42.220> go<00:04:42.370> back<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.880> basics<00:04:43.360> you

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
because you go back to the basics you

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.890 
because you go back to the basics you
save<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.020> as<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.169> picture<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.890> then<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.669> just

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
save it as a picture and then you just

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.020 
save it as a picture and then you just
use<00:04:46.900> gallery<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.770> flick<00:04:48.010> through<00:04:48.220> there's

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
use gallery to flick through there's

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.630 
use gallery to flick through there's
another<00:04:49.360> there's<00:04:49.930> another<00:04:50.260> app<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:51.610> just

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
another there's another app that just

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.390 
another there's another app that just
without<00:04:52.450> going<00:04:52.720> through<00:04:53.020> any<00:04:53.050> extreme<00:04:56.400> will

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
without going through any extreme will

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.200 
without going through any extreme will
just<00:04:57.610> display<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.300> as<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:59.050> time<00:04:59.260> goes<00:04:59.530> in<00:04:59.770> and

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
just display it as the time goes in and

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.950 
just display it as the time goes in and
so<00:05:01.890> I'll<00:05:02.890> go<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.130> slide<00:05:03.430> one<00:05:03.750> it's<00:05:04.750> called
