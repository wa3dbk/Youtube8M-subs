00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello we are all here the companies are 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.660
 of all the jobs that happened to you 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.500
 do so far what is that 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.930
 artistically you feel more on yourself 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.930
 well then surely 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.800
 when that period is spoken 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.920
 no 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.480
 for me the first time his new one 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.700
 you see it 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.910
 when it puts the extreme in our case 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 in particular 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.360
 you had 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.900
 how can inspiring you even before 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.470
 start this band is connected 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.780
 of inspiration above all 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.030
 the wine stop because in the context 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.719
 metal 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.900
 this was already cold for me to have at 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.900
 this result it was definitely 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.579
 the house 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:18.049
 because I left the distant city 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.539
 together we searched for others 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.429
 components having as much as some 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.530
 live need to record that we have 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:31.759
 just produced our first year 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:36.439
 that Italian football in the depths e 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.469
 nothing I had the opportunity to be able to 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.130
 going to extremes will be fun 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.369
 as a word prof 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:51.600
 the extreme attempt therefore surely 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.990
 I represent clouding and a part 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:01.170
 of me there is not only that but I would say that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:13.230
 be a big garrison today square 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:15.630
 but what we propose today I propose that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.480
 as well as with this song, however, I have seen 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.480
 this context we have terms are here 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.040
 interesting to propose to the public trot 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.030
 which are the three disks from yours 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.590
 point of view in a library of a 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.519
 drummer must not miss 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.840
 well then since i'm talking about 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.870
 however metal definitely advice of 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.340
 amos thesis of whose mood I am trying 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.290
 however to put extreme then 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:03:01.799
 next speed from 200 250 e 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:05.849
 then and then level 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.040
 let's say so emotional then putting a 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.470
 moment by moment the technique was like this 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.470
 certainly 13 favorite garments 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.260
 neither warm nor metallic but for how much 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.800
 so many zero because they sang it that way 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.090
 as a commercial thief however second 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.800
 me is really representative of metals 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.580
 I 'm not doing that thrash metal anymore 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.930
 so a middle ground that in my opinion 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.970
 the one that came out to conquer everything 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.770
 the public, however, for me when i 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.430
 metallic sound live are unique in 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.709
 sense they are one of the few bands that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.990
 we also prepare bishop from time to 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:57.390
 put something to the whole audience 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.950
 everything therefore definitely black album 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.520
 I think it's an album that deserves to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:08.550
 be heard and then the other album 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:12.209
 let's see if they would ever band a son 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.709
 his maybe with the friend outside are 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.570
 those from the chest to maybe even i 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.570
 porcupine tree or 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:27.680
 take away other bands and it would be a list 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:32.470
 quite infinite I am elisa e 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.470
 follow us on the next ilike
