that<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> main<00:01:04.290> idea<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.010> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that was the main idea and then in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.100 
that was the main idea and then in
during<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.120> shooting<00:01:06.480> we<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.810> actually

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
during the shooting we would actually

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.289 
during the shooting we would actually
play<00:01:07.230> with<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.620> idea<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.850> started<00:01:09.149> out

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
play with the idea so we started out

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
play with the idea so we started out
first<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.840> scouting<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> model<00:01:11.280> who

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
first of all scouting for a model who

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
first of all scouting for a model who
was<00:01:11.610> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> slim<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.659> fit<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.229> well<00:01:13.259> they

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
was kind of slim very fit as well they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.789 
was kind of slim very fit as well they
trained<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> obviously<00:01:15.270> black<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.869> well<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
trained and obviously black as well so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
trained and obviously black as well so
we<00:01:16.920> found<00:01:17.189> unless<00:01:17.520> Salahi's<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.360> model<00:01:18.659> here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we found unless Salahi's also model here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.660 
we found unless Salahi's also model here
from<00:01:18.960> South<00:01:19.110> Africa<00:01:19.590> pretty<00:01:19.950> fit<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> his

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
from South Africa pretty fit and his

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
from South Africa pretty fit and his
awesome<00:01:21.119> model<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> was<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> right

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
awesome model and was for me the right

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
awesome model and was for me the right
person<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.189> project<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.659> well

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
we also this time shut the whole project

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
we also this time shut the whole project
in<00:01:28.290> studio<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.610> rented<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.119> small

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
studio space and we also added a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.240 
studio space and we also added a
background<00:01:33.899> so<00:01:34.140> basically<00:01:34.649> just<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.950> fifty

percent<00:01:35.579> black<00:01:35.820> background<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.600> works<00:01:37.289> only

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
percent black background and works only

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
percent black background and works only
with<00:01:37.890> three<00:01:38.280> lights<00:01:38.579> first<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
with three lights first of all we
started<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.289> just<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:41.009> strip<00:01:41.369> lights

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
started out just with two strip lights

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.569 
started out just with two strip lights
left<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> right<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.110> had<00:01:43.560> first<00:01:44.369> we

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
left and right we actually had first we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
left and right we actually had first we
do<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.939> grid<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.350> we

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
do have grid on here right now but we

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130 
do have grid on here right now but we
actually<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:47.039> just<00:01:47.369> two<00:01:47.579> lights<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.329> just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
actually use just two lights with just

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050 
actually use just two lights with just
the<00:01:49.320> diffusing<00:01:49.799> material<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.460> left<00:01:50.789> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the diffusing material from left and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
the diffusing material from left and
right<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> place<00:01:52.500> them<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.859> little

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
right and kind of place them a little

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
right and kind of place them a little
bit<00:01:53.280> behind<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:54.090> model<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.990> literally

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bit behind the model so not literally

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
bit behind the model so not literally
next<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> model<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.789> little<00:01:57.000> bit<00:01:57.090> behind

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
next to the model a little bit behind

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330 
next to the model a little bit behind
the<00:01:57.719> model<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.710> room<00:01:58.920> light<00:01:59.100> would

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the model so the room light would

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.550 
the model so the room light would
actually<00:01:59.670> spill<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.210> bit<00:02:00.479> over<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
actually spill a little bit over to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.940

LaSala
and<00:02:03.159> also<00:02:03.579> on<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> background<00:02:04.659> so<00:02:04.840> we<00:02:04.960> kind

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
and also on to the background so we kind

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.870 
and also on to the background so we kind
of<00:02:05.259> have<00:02:05.469> a<00:02:05.500> little<00:02:05.860> bit<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.189> 50-percent

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
of have a little bit of a 50-percent

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.059 
of have a little bit of a 50-percent
gray<00:02:07.180> as<00:02:07.390> well<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.319> background<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.890> we

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
gray as well on the background and we

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.889 
gray as well on the background and we
have<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> bit<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.580> detail<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.149> there<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.750> it's

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
have a bit of detail on there so it's

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.050 
have a bit of detail on there so it's
easier<00:02:11.200> for<00:02:11.260> comping<00:02:11.800> again<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.310> also<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.910> we

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
easier for comping again and also if we

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.610 
easier for comping again and also if we
would<00:02:13.300> have<00:02:13.330> added<00:02:13.629> some<00:02:14.050> leaves<00:02:14.349> or

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
would have added some leaves or

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.559 
would have added some leaves or
something<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.220> there<00:02:15.400> but<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:16.360> throughout

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
something in there but then throughout

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.449 
something in there but then throughout
the<00:02:16.810> process<00:02:17.019> we<00:02:17.410> thought<00:02:17.650> okay<00:02:17.890> well<00:02:18.099> maybe

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
the process we thought okay well maybe

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.890 
the process we thought okay well maybe
scratch<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:19.090> idea<00:02:19.239> what<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.720> leaves

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
scratch that idea what the leaves

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.330 
scratch that idea what the leaves
