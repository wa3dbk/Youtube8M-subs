00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
first Rick or Richard well I think this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.510 
first Rick or Richard well I think this
is<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.440> easy<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> think<00:00:41.160> Richard

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
is an easy one right I think Richard

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
is an easy one right I think Richard
without<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> doubt<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> Sun<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> more

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
without a doubt I think the Sun is more

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
without a doubt I think the Sun is more
likely<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> leave<00:00:43.739> first<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.399> simply

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
likely to leave first and it's simply

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
likely to leave first and it's simply
because<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> don't<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.750> Minnesota<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
because I don't think Minnesota is the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.650 
because I don't think Minnesota is the
end-all<00:00:47.370> be-all<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.059> great<00:00:48.300> coach<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
end-all be-all for any great coach and

one<00:01:04.080> again<00:01:04.379> Edwin's<00:01:05.129> enit<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:06.390> guy's<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
one again Edwin's enit this guy's one of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.030 
one again Edwin's enit this guy's one of
the<00:01:06.960> hottest<00:01:07.140> names<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> game<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:07.979> now

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the hottest names in the game right now

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.679 
the hottest names in the game right now
and<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.340> think<00:01:08.700> Minnesota<00:01:09.180> doesn't<00:01:09.600> have

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and I just think Minnesota doesn't have

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
and I just think Minnesota doesn't have
the<00:01:09.780> facilities<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> keep<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.890> hard

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the facilities to keep them it's a hard

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.560 
the facilities to keep them it's a hard
sell<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.640> people<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.180> north<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sell to get people to go up north and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
sell to get people to go up north and
coach<00:01:12.780> their<00:01:13.080> IRA<00:01:13.950> play<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.490> don't

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
coach their IRA play there and I don't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.710 
coach their IRA play there and I don't
think<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> place<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.509> stays
