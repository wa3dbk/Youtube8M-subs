00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 among the range of disciplines 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.270
 proposed this weekend at the dog show 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.220
 agility is more about gymnastics 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.349
 for dogs than the traditional parade 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 of beauty for the master as for his 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 animal training is mandatory 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.699
 these four-legged sportsmen are 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 full-fledged athletes about 18 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 months of preparation for dogs 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.300
 can start making contests 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.010
 we know a lot 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.010
 drive but like the dog he 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.529
 also takes a lot of fun 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 it's a nice workout sure he 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.100
 must be done in security for the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 dog and then teach him the rules 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 we are complying with a regulation against a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.360
 sports discipline a little more 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 fanciful the parade a harmony 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.010
 back in the past a historical page 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 the use of the dog by their tone 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.239
 when the dog was little cemetery of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 work so in small spots 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.860
 transport of wood transport of cans of 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.890
 milk 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.690
 these are the people who did not have 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.620
 the means to buy a horse was a 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:12.520
 fact afford to have a dog 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.200
 cart carried different thing 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.850
 everything is done in this exhibition 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.460
 canine for all these disciplines 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.200
 is going on at best these parades where these 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.270
 sports must be a show for the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 public but not just the dog has to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.520
 also be comfortable here on the expo 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.280
 like here their loved ones their loved ones and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.570
 the college sealed at the size of the rings 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.220
 is true they are really small 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.180
 that's a little bit of me that's something 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.400
 something we see more and more 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.380
 unfortunately in the expos we think 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.690
 the organizers people think not 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.970
 always to dogs they tend to 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.800
 keep ring really very small that me 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.399
 we race ourselves as noted by the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.960
 Bordeaux coach 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.820
 me especially my dog who is 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.649
 that a rather dynamic dog that she put 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.330
 to run so that they like this 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.500
 morning he was not comfortable what he 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.430
 was stressed but they were they 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 were not comfortable because he 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.690
 could not find his rhythm so 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.700
 after I do not know if it's because of his 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.820
 voice me personally I he did 3rd 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.720
 this morning I can not say that but in 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.150
 anyway what is certain is that at 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.930
 level of paces the dog was not 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.799
 compared to the size of the cold he 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.989
 was not in his element 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.290
 so far the public has not shunned his 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.330
 pleasure 2650 visitors were able to admire 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.070
 his doggies and for some they are 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.290
 not left not empty but with 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.230
 a first place on the podium 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.870
 a Tibetan spanish won the best 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.220
 in show in front of an American cocker spaniel and a 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 terrier fox terrier
