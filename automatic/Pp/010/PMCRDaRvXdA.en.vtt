00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello friends that such a treat to greet them 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.700
 this time we solve a problem 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.830
 with the windows 8 update and it 's 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.870
 that basically this is a problem of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.150
 configuration as the message says 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 good when we download the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 updates and we can install them 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 once the process starts after 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 that restarts shows us a message 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 which says configuration error of the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.310
 windows updates reversing 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 the changes 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 well come on we give windows e in the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.260
 keyboard we go to configuration panel 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.260
 control search and correct problems 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.210
 ok now we seek to correct problems with 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 windows update let's go to options 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.160
 advanced we see that the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.050
 box and execute as administrator 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.960
 once we see everything we give in 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.560
 next and we hope it solves the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.890
 problems this process is not so delayed 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.900
 it takes basically a few seconds or it can 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.650
 take a minute but it can not take 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.820
 much more once the problem is 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 solve 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 is to proceed to solve the problems and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 once as I said once it was 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 solve the problems we can already 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.690
 close the window in this case the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690
 windows 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.180
 and we can install again the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.000
 updates normally when 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.930
 close where it has been corrected 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.520
 we close 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 we search for windows update 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 but they 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.320
 the difference is that this is the one of the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.830
 metro screen and this is not there although there 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.180
 look for updates and we learn to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.120
 look for the areas that look for them 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 we install with normality and that's it 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.850
 all 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.510
 practically everything good says goodbye 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.510
 greetings bai
