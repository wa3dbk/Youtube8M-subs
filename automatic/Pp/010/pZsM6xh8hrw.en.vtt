00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.220
 apply by the heat of my finger and 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.930

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.670
 to take the tones without sidecar that are 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.890

 to do is apply right in the corner 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.590
 outside and with it I will create a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.700
 sort of tail as an eyeliner but 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.180

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.219

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.930
 slim catch this tone here that is a tone 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.359

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.870

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.019
 I'm going to unite with the corner that I have 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.019

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.530
 Now I'm going to take a brown pencil and 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.100
 delineate the upper and lower ring 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.100
 of water 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.850

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.240
 made to the tabs and apply 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.240

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.200
 t 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.610
 let's go to the face you can clean 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.889
 the area if you have seen that you have fallen 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.260
 the product if you do not go directly to 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.410
 apply the base 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.410
 do not 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.870
 I have decided to apply a base of one 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.850
 very light coverage but if you think that 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.819
 you need it or you just want it 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.430
 What you want is to apply a base with greater 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.009
 coverage as a proofreader continues to apply 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.080
 one with more cosmetic scene coverage and 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.210
 total excell and transforming concealer 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.430
 that then you always ask me everything 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.319
 transform it into concealer is a 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.280
 awesome product so let's go to 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.280
 apply where you need it 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.960
