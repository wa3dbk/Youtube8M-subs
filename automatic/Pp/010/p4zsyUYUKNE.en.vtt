and then you do left and right and it

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.160 
and then you do left and right and it
just<00:02:06.729> goes<00:02:06.909> up<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.299> down<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.869> alarm

clock<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.649> then<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:09.670> timer<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.209> same<00:02:10.450> way

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
clock and then the timer is the same way

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.400 
clock and then the timer is the same way
that's<00:02:12.220> about<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:13.420> works<00:02:13.750> very<00:02:13.989> well<00:02:14.079> is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
that's about it all works very well is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:24.710 
that's about it all works very well is
very<00:02:14.620> easy<00:02:14.829> very<00:02:15.660> logical<00:02:16.660> system

there<00:02:27.079> are<00:02:27.260> sensors<00:02:27.709> around<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:28.340> all<00:02:28.879> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
there are sensors around here all the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.789 
there are sensors around here all the
way<00:02:29.209> around<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> other<00:02:29.959> side<00:02:30.200> also<00:02:30.439> back

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
way around on the other side also back

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.880 
way around on the other side also back
here<00:02:31.159> there's<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:31.939> camera<00:02:32.180> up<00:02:32.420> here<00:02:32.750> which<00:02:33.530> maps

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
here there's a camera up here which maps

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.520 
here there's a camera up here which maps
your<00:02:34.329> ceiling<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.870> here<00:02:36.200> there's<00:02:36.409> an

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
your ceiling and in here there's an

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.380 
your ceiling and in here there's an
infrared<00:02:36.890> sensor<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.579> I<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:37.939> talks<00:02:38.180> to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
infrared sensor that I think talks to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.349 
infrared sensor that I think talks to
this<00:02:38.590> talks<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.890> remote<00:02:40.159> as<00:02:40.700> well<00:02:43.359> and

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
this talks to the remote as well and

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.390 
this talks to the remote as well and
then<00:02:44.659> do<00:02:44.870> if<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:45.769> want<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.129> to<00:02:46.159> go

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
then do if you just want it to go

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.190 
then do if you just want it to go
you<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:46.879> either<00:02:46.970> push<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.390> button<00:02:47.659> here<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
you can either push the button here and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.899 
you can either push the button here and
it<00:02:48.560> will<00:02:48.590> start<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.129> or<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.459> can<00:02:49.579> push<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
it will start going or you can push the

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.020 
it will start going or you can push the
button<00:02:49.939> here<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.750> that's<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:52.030> will

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
button here and that's it it just will

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:03.240 
button here and that's it it just will
take<00:02:53.060> off<00:02:53.390> by<00:02:53.629> itself<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.769> all<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.010> way<00:02:55.159> there

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.750 

she<00:03:04.250> goes

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.760 

you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.820 

this<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.070> dustbin

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
this is the dustbin

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.050 
this is the dustbin
the<00:03:13.360> 989<00:03:14.360> 20<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.490> push<00:03:16.490> this<00:03:16.730> pull

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
the 989 20 and you just push this pull

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.120 
the 989 20 and you just push this pull
it<00:03:17.150> out<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:18.460> it<00:03:19.460> opens<00:03:19.820> here<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:21.130> as

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
it out and it opens here like this as

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.560 
it out and it opens here like this as
far<00:03:22.340> as<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.520> can<00:03:22.580> tell<00:03:22.790> it's<00:03:22.940> got<00:03:23.060> about<00:03:23.270> three

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
far as I can tell it's got about three

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.630 
far as I can tell it's got about three
elements<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:24.710> going<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.100> get

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
elements to it it's going to get

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.270 
elements to it it's going to get
well<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.750> main<00:03:26.930> bin<00:03:27.230> back<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.010> keeps

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
well the main bin back here that keeps

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.080 
well the main bin back here that keeps
the<00:03:28.430> dust<00:03:28.660> it's<00:03:29.660> got<00:03:29.960> this<00:03:30.790> screen<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.060> a

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
the dust it's got this screen it's a

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.380 
the dust it's got this screen it's a
very<00:03:32.300> fine<00:03:32.630> screen<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.000> got<00:03:35.210> this

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
very fine screen and then it's got this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.890 
very fine screen and then it's got this
I<00:03:35.690> think<00:03:36.050> they<00:03:36.230> call<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.620> HEPA<00:03:37.750> filter<00:03:38.750> that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
I think they call it a HEPA filter that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.110 
I think they call it a HEPA filter that
pops<00:03:39.200> out<00:03:40.120> looks<00:03:41.120> like<00:03:41.240> it's<00:03:41.860> something<00:03:42.860> to

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
pops out looks like it's something to

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.580 
pops out looks like it's something to
clean<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.270> until<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:44.690> no<00:03:45.080> good<00:03:45.320> then<00:03:45.530> you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
clean it until it's no good then you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:04:05.500 
clean it until it's no good then you
throw<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:45.950> away<00:03:46.040> type<00:03:46.460> thing<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:51.260> that's<00:03:51.470> it

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.569
