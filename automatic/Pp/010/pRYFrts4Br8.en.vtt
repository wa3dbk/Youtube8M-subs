 physical with all the troy arrives 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.719
 for frankly it's Islamism in the same station 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:13.669
 these practices 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.579
 it's really handy 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.070
 the title edf that protect itself is really good because it avoids 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.070
 to have one all the teams around him he says 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.199
 our standardized contracts what besides if you have no station

 pretty well worked with the architect a protective mask 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.270
 a gas mask 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.390

 not done a lot of the office 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.510
 it's very very important 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.889
 when you have a very long session of your country 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.600
 m or so of an extraction system 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.449
 that makes it possible to have a vapors happens to create 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.449
 in an apartment it's not possible you do not have to go 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.610
 on the outside 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.999
 to settle another 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.720
 his center 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.800
 I went in his direction 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.440
 because I know that when I see what we hear in the hÃ©rault 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.960
 after as long as we elected and Swiss who do not even have to throw the mask 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.450
 almost for a moment as long as we love and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.940
 here are some moments in my tribe over one 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.760
 the tactics for now to follow 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.100
 if we go behind him 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.470
 things like that we have to protect ourselves this sector 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.830
 it's essential legrand is the name where you do not have to have too much 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.910
 painting on the skin with alcohol because it's so difficult it's more 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.750
 hard to pick

 it's done this more 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.980
 but to summarize that is that it's important 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.069
 the arrest of m 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.369
