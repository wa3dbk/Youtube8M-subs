00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.480
 This video is especially good for seniors and women 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.320
 We will tell you why the flight distance can not be extended and how to solve it. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.190
 Then we introduce practice drill 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 Head efficiency is the cause of the lack of distance 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.810
 I have not used it 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.080
 I think you should raise it the most 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 This time 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.640
 Split hand grip 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.640
 We will continue to use the clip to live talk between of Te' 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.050
 Holding the head like this makes the head big 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.079
 I think you can feel the turn coming 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 Small swing is fine, even if you don't want to fly the ball 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.740
 Address the split- up ball with the split-hand energy firmly 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.970
 It's okay if you come back a little bit 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.890
 from here 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.400
 The back swing 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.120
 It is an image that stretches out the right hand 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.820
 Firmly in the line of follow 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.390
 And if Ikere stretched out his right hand 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.020
 In this way, we hit it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.109
 Head accelerates from impact water 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.710
 We will increase the head speed and lead to distance increase 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.710
 Please follow this practice and try it . 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.240
