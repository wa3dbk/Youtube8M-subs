the first half but I wasn't following

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.589 
the first half but I wasn't following
the<00:00:17.040> way<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> trained<00:00:17.759> if<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.119> trained<00:00:18.420> at

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
the way that I trained if I trained at

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.010 
the way that I trained if I trained at
all

all

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.749 
all
I<00:00:19.050> was<00:00:19.560> running<00:00:20.009> pretty<00:00:20.130> much<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.550> whole<00:00:20.700> time

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.839 
I was running pretty much the whole time
and<00:00:21.329> I<00:00:22.020> didn't<00:00:22.770> train<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.489> I<00:00:23.520> figured

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
and I didn't train for that so I figured

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.690

easy and follow the way I trained and
just<00:00:29.099> enjoy<00:00:29.399> it<00:00:29.460> instead<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.910> pushing<00:00:30.239> myself
