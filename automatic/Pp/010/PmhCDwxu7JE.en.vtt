bits and pieces front drive units not
much<00:00:25.289> use<00:00:25.590> might<00:00:25.890> grab<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> wheels<00:00:26.369> they're

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
much use might grab the wheels they're

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.019 
much use might grab the wheels they're
kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> big<00:00:28.490> yeah<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.580> gonna<00:00:29.699> pull<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
kind of big yeah I'm gonna pull this

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
kind of big yeah I'm gonna pull this
engineer<00:00:30.650> start<00:00:31.650> probably<00:00:31.830> start<00:00:32.160> today<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.579> I

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
engineer start probably start today if I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.979 
engineer start probably start today if I
can<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> lift<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.420> off<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> top

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
can get them to lift this off the top

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.209 
can get them to lift this off the top
it's<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.800> attached<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.309> anything<00:00:36.800> that's<00:00:37.800> why

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's not attached to anything that's why

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
it's not attached to anything that's why
I'm<00:00:38.460> one-eighth<00:00:39.390> 6d<00:00:42.469> everything's<00:00:43.469> pretty

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I'm one-eighth 6d everything's pretty

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.330 
I'm one-eighth 6d everything's pretty
much<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:48.350> sort<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> ran<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> memory<00:00:49.950> there

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
much the sort of ran out of memory there

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.200 
much the sort of ran out of memory there
but<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:50.730> good<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:52.350> said<00:00:52.559> 79<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
but it's all good that said 79 a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
but it's all good that said 79 a
biofilter<00:00:54.210> I've<00:00:54.930> checked<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> oil<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
biofilter I've checked the oil on it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.080 
biofilter I've checked the oil on it
that's<00:00:55.920> good<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:56.940> there's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that's good I don't know if there's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
that's good I don't know if there's
coolant<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.690> no<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> radio<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.920> looks

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
coolant in it no the radio it looks

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.510 
coolant in it no the radio it looks
stuffed<00:01:00.289> it's<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> good<00:01:01.649> starter<00:01:02.070> motor<00:01:02.280> on

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
stuffed it's got a good starter motor on

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.710 
stuffed it's got a good starter motor on
it<00:01:04.460> yeah<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> logical<00:01:06.330> thing<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.600> do

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it yeah that's the logical thing to do

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.920 
it yeah that's the logical thing to do
see<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> does

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.020 

janab<00:01:12.650> steppin<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.370> hydraulic<00:01:13.820> oil

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
janab steppin this is hydraulic oil

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.940 
janab steppin this is hydraulic oil
everywhere<00:01:14.690> made<00:01:15.110> us<00:01:15.230> spill<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.620> other<00:01:15.740> day

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
everywhere made us spill the other day

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.200 
everywhere made us spill the other day
so<00:01:16.010> we're<00:01:16.370> still<00:01:16.550> in<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.730> process<00:01:16.850> of

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
so we're still in the process of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:02:21.320 
so we're still in the process of
cleaning<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.630> up

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.900 

they<00:02:22.330> don't<00:02:22.510> do<00:02:22.600> for<00:02:22.750> now

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
they don't do for now

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.950 
they don't do for now
hydraulics<00:02:24.910> still<00:02:25.180> work<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.690> I'm<00:02:25.780> just

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
hydraulics still work but I'm just

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.330 
hydraulics still work but I'm just
pumping<00:02:26.260> fluid<00:02:26.650> through<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.890> drum<00:02:27.160> at<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
pumping fluid through a drum at the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.070 
pumping fluid through a drum at the
moment<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.060> not<00:02:28.180> particularly<00:02:28.540> good<00:02:28.870> for

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
moment so it's not particularly good for

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.660 
moment so it's not particularly good for
it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.230 
it
yeah<00:02:31.210> what<00:02:31.420> else<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.780> say<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.020> works<00:02:33.240> our

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
yeah what else can I say it works our

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.430 
yeah what else can I say it works our
ofy<00:02:34.720> nautical<00:02:35.410> filter<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:37.230> hydraulic<00:02:38.230> oil

ofy nautical filter for hydraulic oil

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.050 
ofy nautical filter for hydraulic oil
that's<00:02:38.740> easy<00:02:38.980> enough<00:02:39.130> about<00:02:39.580> when<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
that's easy enough about when I'm on the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.080 
that's easy enough about when I'm on the
Shelf<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.830> hydraulic<00:02:42.340> lines<00:02:42.610> going<00:02:42.940> back

Shelf the hydraulic lines going back
down<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.330> here<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:45.490> main<00:02:45.670> problem<00:02:45.970> with<00:02:46.000> this

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
down to here the main problem with this

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.580 
down to here the main problem with this
was<00:02:46.360> they<00:02:46.510> couldn't<00:02:46.810> get<00:02:46.930> parts<00:02:47.350> for<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
was they couldn't get parts for the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.680 
was they couldn't get parts for the
transmission<00:02:48.070> or<00:02:48.310> something<00:02:48.700> they<00:02:49.510> just

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
transmission or something they just

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.880 
transmission or something they just
couldn't<00:02:49.840> find<00:02:50.050> them<00:02:50.260> or<00:02:50.350> couldn't<00:02:50.530> get<00:02:50.770> them

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
couldn't find them or couldn't get them

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.610 
couldn't find them or couldn't get them
and<00:02:51.070> they<00:02:51.220> ended<00:02:51.400> up<00:02:51.520> parting<00:02:51.910> most<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:52.330> out

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
mmm definitely needs an oil change but

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.259 
mmm definitely needs an oil change but
it's<00:03:20.519> there

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.369 

typical<00:03:24.269> I'll<00:03:24.390> again<00:03:24.629> while<00:03:24.870> they<00:03:24.989> get<00:03:25.079> really

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
typical I'll again while they get really

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.360 
typical I'll again while they get really
clattering<00:03:25.859> when<00:03:25.980> they<00:03:26.069> get<00:03:26.189> old<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
clattering when they get old but that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.099 
clattering when they get old but that
should<00:03:29.670> unbolt<00:03:29.969> straight<00:03:30.359> there<00:03:30.689> through<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
should unbolt straight there through the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.839 
should unbolt straight there through the
bell<00:03:31.290> housing<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.129> just<00:03:32.280> unbolt<00:03:32.549> that

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
bell housing and just unbolt that

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.780 
bell housing and just unbolt that
separate<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.569> motor<00:03:36.079> separate<00:03:37.670> it's<00:03:38.670> like

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
separate the motor separate it's like

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.759 
separate the motor separate it's like
front<00:03:39.120> end<00:03:39.299> bolts<00:03:39.599> there<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.379> a<00:03:40.409> bit<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.650> work

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
front end bolts there it's a bit of work

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.629 
front end bolts there it's a bit of work
to<00:03:40.829> get<00:03:41.099> it<00:03:41.189> out<00:03:42.109> but<00:03:43.109> yeah<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:45.480> hard<00:03:45.750> just<00:03:46.639> a

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
to get it out but yeah not hard just a

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.339 
to get it out but yeah not hard just a
bit<00:03:47.760> time-consuming<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.840> want<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.200> get<00:03:49.290> a

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
bit time-consuming so I want to get a

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.250 
bit time-consuming so I want to get a
start<00:03:49.680> on<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.859> today<00:03:50.810> then<00:03:51.810> I'll<00:03:51.930> resume

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
start on it today then I'll resume

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.140 
start on it today then I'll resume
tomorrow<00:03:52.680> which<00:03:52.919> is<00:03:52.950> Saturday<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.730> hopefully

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
tomorrow which is Saturday and hopefully

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:09.520 
tomorrow which is Saturday and hopefully
trailer<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.629> home<00:04:02.299> blew<00:04:03.299> up<00:04:03.859> that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.249 

it's<00:04:10.530> probably<00:04:11.430> only<00:04:11.579> part<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.060> carnage

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.379 

comes<00:04:16.259> out<00:04:16.440> here<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:17.310> drive<00:04:17.579> flange<00:04:18.000> for<00:04:18.269> one

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
comes out here to drive flange for one

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.659 
comes out here to drive flange for one
of<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.539> rear<00:04:18.690> wheels<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.250> blinding<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
of the rear wheels so it's blinding the

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.600 
of the rear wheels so it's blinding the
death<00:04:20.850> up<00:04:22.070> probably<00:04:23.070> get<00:04:23.220> all<00:04:23.310> these<00:04:23.430> bits

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
death up probably get all these bits

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.750 
death up probably get all these bits
with<00:04:23.820> every<00:04:24.000> ridiculously<00:04:24.509> expensive
