00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
instead of just holding it in the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.970 
instead of just holding it in the
trigger<00:05:14.830> come<00:05:15.130> look<00:05:15.250> at<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.610> trigger<00:05:16.050> then<00:05:17.050> it

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
trigger come look at the trigger then it

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.390 
trigger come look at the trigger then it
works<00:05:18.160> out<00:05:18.310> good<00:05:18.550> oh<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:20.170> clip<00:05:20.470> is<00:05:20.620> long

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
works out good oh the clip is long

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.730 
works out good oh the clip is long
enough<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.910> get<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.420> free<00:05:22.870> piece<00:05:23.110> I've<00:05:23.380> gotten<00:05:23.710> a

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
enough to get a free piece I've gotten a

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.310 
enough to get a free piece I've gotten a
couple<00:05:23.890> three<00:05:24.160> pieces<00:05:24.400> with<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.960> maybe<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.200> you

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
couple three pieces with it maybe if you

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.010 
couple three pieces with it maybe if you
get<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.470> headshot<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:27.040> can<00:05:27.160> get<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.280> full<00:05:27.490> piece

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.650 
get a headshot you can get a full piece
but<00:05:29.020> it's<00:05:29.380> definitely<00:05:29.800> not<00:05:30.280> like<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:31.030> AK<00:05:31.450> I

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660

but it's definitely not like the AK I
don't<00:05:31.840> think<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.170> good<00:05:32.200> zik<00:05:32.650> I<00:05:32.980> wouldn't

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
don't think it's a good zik I wouldn't

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.740 
don't think it's a good zik I wouldn't
go<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.460> far<00:05:33.550> because<00:05:33.910> yeah<00:05:34.270> okay<00:05:34.480> you<00:05:34.540> can

because one we we pretty much three
captain<00:06:09.970> the<00:06:10.060> whole<00:06:10.180> time<00:06:10.390> of<00:06:10.420> this<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:10.960> so

captain the whole time of this and so

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.780 
captain the whole time of this and so
the<00:06:11.200> game<00:06:11.350> in<00:06:11.530> pretty<00:06:11.830> quickly<00:06:12.070> I<00:06:12.250> was<00:06:12.490> playing

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
the game in pretty quickly I was playing

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.050 
the game in pretty quickly I was playing
with<00:06:12.970> people<00:06:13.480> that<00:06:13.630> know<00:06:14.010> so<00:06:15.010> you<00:06:15.070> know<00:06:15.430> there

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
with people that know so you know there

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.340 
with people that know so you know there
were<00:06:16.150> other<00:06:16.270> people<00:06:16.600> on<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.750> team<00:06:16.930> like

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
were other people on the team like

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.330 
were other people on the team like
someone<00:06:17.530> else<00:06:17.710> got<00:06:17.860> dogs<00:06:18.130> and<00:06:18.550> beware

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
someone else got dogs and beware

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.800 
someone else got dogs and beware
copters<00:06:19.669> and<00:06:19.790> all<00:06:19.850> that<00:06:19.940> stuff<00:06:20.060> so<00:06:20.210> obviously

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
copters and all that stuff so obviously

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.990 
copters and all that stuff so obviously
that<00:06:21.020> makes<00:06:21.230> it<00:06:21.440> harder<00:06:22.400> to<00:06:22.460> kill<00:06:22.790> people

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
that makes it harder to kill people

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.720 
that makes it harder to kill people
there's<00:06:23.570> less<00:06:23.720> people<00:06:24.050> kill<00:06:24.290> on<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.470> map<00:06:24.730> and

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
there's less people kill on the map and

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.900 
there's less people kill on the map and
yeah<00:06:26.330> but<00:06:26.710> this<00:06:27.710> isn't<00:06:27.889> like<00:06:28.160> one<00:06:28.639> of<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:28.790> best

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
yeah but this isn't like one of the best

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.230 
yeah but this isn't like one of the best
game<00:06:29.150> times<00:06:29.389> I<00:06:29.479> couldn't<00:06:29.810> come<00:06:29.990> up<00:06:30.110> with

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
game times I couldn't come up with

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.879 
game times I couldn't come up with
mainly<00:06:32.240> because<00:06:32.389> of<00:06:32.570> people<00:06:33.199> using<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.680> game

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
mainly because of people using the game

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.520 
mainly because of people using the game
you<00:06:34.370> know<00:06:34.460> you<00:06:35.150> get<00:06:35.360> a<00:06:35.389> good<00:06:35.690> gameplay<00:06:36.139> going

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
you know you get a good gameplay going

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.890 
you know you get a good gameplay going
and<00:06:37.280> so<00:06:37.699> you<00:06:37.760> have<00:06:37.970> like<00:06:38.120> 60<00:06:38.419> kills<00:06:38.720> and

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
and so you have like 60 kills and

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.330 
and so you have like 60 kills and
everyone<00:06:39.169> just<00:06:39.199> leaves<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:39.620> game<00:06:39.770> and<00:06:40.100> it's

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
everyone just leaves the game and it's

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.969 
everyone just leaves the game and it's
just<00:06:40.490> I<00:06:40.610> was<00:06:41.000> kind<00:06:41.270> of<00:06:41.300> going<00:06:41.449> I<00:06:41.979> think

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
just I was kind of going I think

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.890 
just I was kind of going I think
honestly<00:06:43.550> think<00:06:43.790> treyarch<00:06:44.120> should<00:06:44.330> put<00:06:44.630> in<00:06:44.810> a

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
honestly think treyarch should put in a

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.810 
honestly think treyarch should put in a
penalty<00:06:45.320> people<00:06:45.830> even<00:06:46.010> again<00:06:46.340> would<00:06:46.550> make<00:06:46.729> it

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
penalty people even again would make it

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.310 
penalty people even again would make it
where<00:06:46.940> they<00:06:47.000> can't<00:06:47.210> play<00:06:47.419> for<00:06:47.870> another<00:06:48.050> 30

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
where they can't play for another 30

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.170 
where they can't play for another 30
minutes<00:06:48.560> you<00:06:49.010> can't<00:06:49.190> rage<00:06:49.400> quit<00:06:49.669> and<00:06:49.880> go<00:06:49.970> into

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
minutes you can't rage quit and go into

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.110 
minutes you can't rage quit and go into
another<00:06:50.330> game<00:06:50.650> what<00:06:51.650> that<00:06:52.400> is<00:06:52.610> a<00:06:52.639> discussion
