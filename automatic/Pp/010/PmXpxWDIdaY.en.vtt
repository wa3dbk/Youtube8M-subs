00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
electrostatic discharging but now that I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.720 
electrostatic discharging but now that I
have<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> more

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

and more and more actual physical course

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.020 
and more and more actual physical course
material<00:02:17.319> in<00:02:17.440> front<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.799> me<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.370> all<00:02:18.670> coming

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
material in front of me it's all coming

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.589 
material in front of me it's all coming
together<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.569> big<00:02:20.159> jigsaw<00:02:21.159> puzzle<00:02:21.640> so
