what<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.550> did<00:01:44.760> here<00:01:45.090> let's<00:01:46.050> put<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.260> bit<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
what we did here let's put a bit of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
what we did here let's put a bit of
fitting<00:01:47.010> at<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> very<00:01:47.430> end<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.970> could

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
fitting at the very end and I could

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.930 
fitting at the very end and I could
stack<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.690> with<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.930> three<00:01:49.229> inch<00:01:49.470> vent<00:01:49.940> because

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
stack out with a three inch vent because

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.900 
stack out with a three inch vent because
you<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.330> have<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:52.220> air<00:01:53.220> movement<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
you got to have more air movement with a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.000 
you got to have more air movement with a
septic<00:01:54.330> tank

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
I've used the equipment shelter so we

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.020 
I've used the equipment shelter so we
bought<00:02:58.500> brought<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.220> vent<00:02:59.459> out<00:02:59.640> from<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
bought brought the vent out from that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.150 
bought brought the vent out from that
three-inch<00:03:00.570> trunk<00:03:00.900> line<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.040> went

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
three-inch trunk line and we just went

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.340 
three-inch trunk line and we just went
up<00:03:02.340> through<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.519> top<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.900> way<00:03:04.079> all<00:03:04.110> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
up through the top and that way all that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.569 
up through the top and that way all that
stuff's<00:03:04.680> covered<00:03:04.980> up<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.220> don't<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
stuff's covered up you don't have to

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.610 
stuff's covered up you don't have to
look<00:03:05.700> at<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.090> or<00:03:06.650> waste<00:03:07.650> space<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:09.500> think<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
look at it or waste space I think the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.819 
look at it or waste space I think the
whole<00:03:10.769> system<00:03:10.980> came<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.519> really<00:03:11.730> well<00:03:11.970> and

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
whole system came out really well and

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.530 
whole system came out really well and
then<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.920> washing<00:03:14.220> machine<00:03:14.519> comes<00:03:14.790> down<00:03:15.060> here

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
then the washing machine comes down here

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.050 
then the washing machine comes down here
and<00:03:15.860> it'll<00:03:16.860> blow<00:03:16.980> out<00:03:17.220> right<00:03:17.430> there<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.880> may

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and it'll blow out right there that may

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.340 
and it'll blow out right there that may
in<00:03:18.239> three-inch<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.900> go<00:03:19.019> down<00:03:21.170> all<00:03:22.170> right<00:03:22.290> I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
in three-inch and go down all right I

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.660 
in three-inch and go down all right I
got<00:03:22.470> one<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.709> sidewalls<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:25.430> these<00:03:26.430> four

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
got one of the sidewalls on these four

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.960 
got one of the sidewalls on these four
piece<00:03:26.880> tubs<00:03:27.209> install<00:03:27.660> really<00:03:27.959> easy<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.970> pulled

that I want to line the plumbing up on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.229 
that I want to line the plumbing up on
it<00:03:36.150> wasn't<00:03:36.600> centered<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.370> thought<00:03:38.610> but

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
it wasn't centered like we thought but

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.050 
it wasn't centered like we thought but
that's<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> good<00:03:39.720> thing<00:03:39.780> about<00:03:39.959> pecs<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.940> can
