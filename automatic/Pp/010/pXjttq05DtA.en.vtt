awkward<00:01:55.560> though<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:57.030> lead<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> getting

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
awkward though as it can lead to getting

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.770 
awkward though as it can lead to getting
stuck<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.409> places<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.399> try<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.299> jump

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
stuck in places like if you try and jump

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
stuck in places like if you try and jump
to<00:02:01.049> someone<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.770> trees<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.310> something<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to someone over trees or something it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
to someone over trees or something it
may<00:02:03.030> teleport<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.869> dump<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
may teleport and just dump you in the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.819 
may teleport and just dump you in the
trees<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.329> does<00:02:06.630> also<00:02:06.930> teleport<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
trees but it does also teleport the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.040 
trees but it does also teleport the
target<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.580> same<00:02:08.849> location<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.750> offset

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
target to the same location then offset

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
target to the same location then offset
them<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.709> slightly<00:02:10.950> closer<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.640> CK's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
them to be slightly closer to CK's

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.309 
them to be slightly closer to CK's
original

which<00:02:13.739> means<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.760> potentially<00:02:15.450> jump<00:02:15.720> out

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
which means you can potentially jump out

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.679 
which means you can potentially jump out
of<00:02:16.230> trees<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.769> something<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:18.269> someone

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
of trees or something and get someone

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.770 
of trees or something and get someone
stuck<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.319> them<00:02:19.650> or<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.150> jump<00:02:21.420> over<00:02:21.689> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
stuck in them or you know jump over the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.449 
stuck in them or you know jump over the
trees<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.079> someone<00:02:22.650> gets<00:02:22.829> stuck<00:02:23.099> right<00:02:23.310> in

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
trees and someone gets stuck right in

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.699 
trees and someone gets stuck right in
the<00:02:23.640> edge<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:24.000> them<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.530> be

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the edge of them and that so it can be

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.460 
the edge of them and that so it can be
kind<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.980> cool<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.629> ability<00:02:27.930> will<00:02:28.140> also

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
kind of cool but the ability will also

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.399 
kind of cool but the ability will also
grant<00:02:28.680> seek<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.069> bonus<00:02:29.489> damage<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.090> 25<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.900> 100

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409

for<00:02:31.620> 1.2<00:02:32.189> seconds<00:02:32.640> or<00:02:32.849> phase<00:02:33.060> next<00:02:33.569> attack<00:02:33.959> so

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
for 1.2 seconds or phase next attack so

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.970 
for 1.2 seconds or phase next attack so
you<00:02:35.189> do<00:02:35.459> get<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.909> pretty<00:02:36.689> hard<00:02:37.049> hit<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.620> next

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you do get a pretty hard hit on the next

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.440 
you do get a pretty hard hit on the next
hit<00:02:38.159> as<00:02:38.310> well<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:41.489> third<00:02:41.790> ability<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.269> a

hit as well this third ability is a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
passive this is chaos strike which gives

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.020 
passive this is chaos strike which gives

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
to 300 percent damage this is basically

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.449 
to 300 percent damage this is basically
the<00:02:51.329> highest<00:02:51.569> crit<00:02:52.200> damage<00:02:52.409> sort<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.069> increase

the highest crit damage sort of increase

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.270 
the highest crit damage sort of increase
in<00:02:53.730> games<00:02:54.090> oh<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.109> at<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.920> lowest

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
in games oh it is at like the lowest

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.789 
in games oh it is at like the lowest
percentage<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.510> only<00:02:57.689> 10<00:02:58.049> percent

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
percentage because it's only 10 percent

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.910 
percentage because it's only 10 percent
it's<00:02:59.579> about<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:02.030> his<00:03:03.030> ultimate<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.920> phantasms

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
it's about it his ultimate is phantasms

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.610 
it's about it his ultimate is phantasms
and<00:03:05.159> this<00:03:05.549> causes<00:03:05.819> CK<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.510> create<00:03:07.049> 1<00:03:07.319> 2<00:03:07.470> 3

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
and this causes CK to create 1 2 3

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.990 
and this causes CK to create 1 2 3
illusions<00:03:08.159> on<00:03:08.310> himself

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
illusions on himself

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.670 
illusions on himself
kinda<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.389> manta<00:03:09.689> or<00:03:10.019> an<00:03:10.200> illusion<00:03:10.349> room

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
kinda like manta or an illusion room

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.559 
kinda like manta or an illusion room
however<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.370> illusions<00:03:11.790> will<00:03:11.970> actually<00:03:12.329> deal

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
however the illusions will actually deal

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.929 
however the illusions will actually deal
a<00:03:12.599> hundred<00:03:13.139> percent<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.829> damage<00:03:14.040> CK<00:03:14.670> deals

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
a hundred percent of the damage CK deals

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.039 
a hundred percent of the damage CK deals
but<00:03:15.720> will<00:03:15.870> take<00:03:16.109> double<00:03:16.500> damage<00:03:16.919> so<00:03:18.049> they'll

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
but will take double damage so they'll

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.110 
but will take double damage so they'll
go<00:03:19.230> down<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.470> lot<00:03:19.709> faster<00:03:19.769> but<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:20.400> deal<00:03:20.699> full

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
go down a lot faster but they deal full

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.839 
go down a lot faster but they deal full
damage<00:03:21.180> which<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.230> main<00:03:22.530> point<00:03:22.889> this

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
damage which is the main point this

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.670 
damage which is the main point this
ability<00:03:24.329> should<00:03:24.389> really<00:03:24.959> be<00:03:25.079> cast<00:03:25.349> near<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
ability should really be cast near the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.680 
ability should really be cast near the
start<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.310> fight<00:03:26.579> as<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.060> will<00:03:27.359> remove

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
