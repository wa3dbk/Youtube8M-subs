00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
sticks here again um I know I said I do

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.860 
sticks here again um I know I said I do
a<00:00:04.350> couple<00:00:04.680> videos<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:06.210> helicopter

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
a couple videos of the the helicopter

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.110 
a couple videos of the the helicopter
here<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.170> Connor<00:00:07.350> bought<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.770> QR<00:00:08.309> 350

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
here that Connor bought the QR 350

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.820 
here that Connor bought the QR 350
whatever<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.599> thousand-dollar<00:00:10.019> one<00:00:10.320> he's

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
whatever the thousand-dollar one he's

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.560 
whatever the thousand-dollar one he's
doing<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.250> return<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> home<00:00:11.880> now<00:00:12.090> he<00:00:12.150> had<00:00:12.420> it

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
doing a return to home now he had it

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.829 
doing a return to home now he had it
about<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:12.990> high<00:00:13.460> he<00:00:14.460> had<00:00:14.790> about<00:00:14.969> 120<00:00:15.690> foot

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
about how high he had about 120 foot

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.019 
about how high he had about 120 foot
here<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.710> probably<00:00:16.949> half<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.730> right

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
here so it's probably half that right

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.670 
here so it's probably half that right
now<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.510> probably<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.840> 60<00:00:19.289> foot<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.650> he

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
now it's probably about 60 foot so he

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.230 
now it's probably about 60 foot so he
just<00:00:19.920> hit<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> return<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.640> home<00:00:20.789> button<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
just hit the return to home button and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.859 
just hit the return to home button and
what<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> does<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.220> um<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.760> spot<00:00:24.210> where<00:00:24.539> he

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
what it does is um the spot where he

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.769 
what it does is um the spot where he
took<00:00:25.080> off<00:00:25.289> from<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.250> lands<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:27.359> within<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
took off from it lands like within a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.800 
took off from it lands like within a
couple<00:00:27.960> meters<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.099> actual<00:00:29.820> spot<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.720> he

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
couple meters of the actual spot that he

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.290 
couple meters of the actual spot that he
took<00:00:31.019> off<00:00:31.199> from<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.120> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
took off from so as you can see it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
took off from so as you can see it's
it's<00:00:33.570> leveling<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.739> slowing<00:00:35.130> down

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it's leveling out and it's slowing down

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
it's leveling out and it's slowing down
is<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.910> getting<00:00:36.149> closer<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> ground<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
is it's getting closer to the ground to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
is it's getting closer to the ground to
you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> safe<00:00:38.550> landing<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.329> that's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you know be a safe landing so that's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
you know be a safe landing so that's
pretty<00:00:39.690> cool<00:00:39.930> yeah<00:00:40.710> he's<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> he's<00:00:41.160> not

pretty cool yeah he's not he's not
touching<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.790> controller<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:42.600> it's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
touching the controller right now it's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
touching the controller right now it's
just<00:00:43.320> returning<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.010> home<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.850> was
