00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.819
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.229
 If I'm 12 I'm sergio again 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.090
 I'm replacing what has been 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.280
 returned to march good already there will be you 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.080
 spoken this is a video as you see it is 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 a screenshot because I'm going to 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.600
 teach'll make chops chops 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.040
 for the class for exams for it 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.440
 you need a program on your computer 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.550
 because it is an odd way I 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.030
 I think it 's the best one I found 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.820
 so far then open the program and it's 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.650
 seemed like a word pretty much 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.110
 you have to do to make the chop 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.380
 is to write how good this has is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.720
 that for example 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.460
 has this that are templates that 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.940
 you can do it on your own 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.710
 but here you have this and you can put the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.690
 chop where the instructions would go 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.930
 for example in this in this box 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.140
 here, the one that I use the most, I think 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.670
 is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.670
 I think it is the most credible 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.969
 here 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 will go out in the ibex as you see the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.250
 right you can change the zoom that is the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 size of the key that is huge 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.860
 up to a size that you can barely read 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.350
 the internet is not what space there is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.090
 between each letter one so a little 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.560
 credible would be because you are the one that I have 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.690
 but with 90 with this depends what 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 ye get but of course is that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.960
 be credible if they look at you page 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.440
 teacher 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440
 that is credible 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.900
 make it good to write here 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.900
 Even though I 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 anything in this case then 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.970
 you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.220
 the class agenda 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.770
 but I have written a good example here 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.690
 desktop you pasted another text that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.150
 I found myself in your case well 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.070
 what you want to put then here comes a 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.870
 little the hard so to speak because 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.910
 Of course it will not always be normal text 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.220
 you can put capitals and all good 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.990
 I imagine that in bold italics and all 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.480
 those things and colors will be seen expose of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.760
 word or some similar program but for 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.640
 example an equation then click here 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.620
 where it says equations I leave all the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.000
 odds and ends this is that some understand 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.490
 others do not know what will be good if 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.090
 you know then you know because they are the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.430
 these rare alpha letters and that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.410
 graphics tables keyword I do not know what 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.380
 it will be good you leave everything and I tell you 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.180
 here you can put what you want then 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.459
 to print it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.100
 this program goes as connected by so 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.390
 say it with internet then when I 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.410
 Guardian asks us here for some data 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.410
 I am going to put 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.510
 example of incorrect data then 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.080
 for example if here in this text you have 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.909
 more than 50% of fouls or whatever 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.099
 any word that does not work in 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.310
 proper names as it goes for internet 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.319
 lets us put in the good if everything would be 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.410
 well choose the language course to everything 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.129
 dais to continue and you can keep it 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.049
 in this case desktop equal then 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.410
 we would have it here saved that is 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.210
 this 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.819
 It is worth once saved what you are going to 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:18.010
 print is this the typox template 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.200
 and not save it here print 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.870
 good in print as you can 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.549
 put more quality you can start not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.829
 I understand a lot of what I know 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.420
 liza first and now you are going to see I'm going to 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.140
 put the camera so you can see what 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.660
 remains 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.640
 Well this would be what 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.130
 what would be this reaction printed 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.810
 this is according to what you would now 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.940
 I will teach how to put it what 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.430
 you remember whole everything and put it in a 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.960
 tÃ­pex i the example i will not do 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.370
 with this one that is the most credible more than 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.130
 nothing because I do not have tip is what I'm going to 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.420
 do with a bottle of font vella I think 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.540
 that there is a template I will try 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.270
 well that's good one thing that I know 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.580
 forget to tell you 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.470
 these leaves I do not know how much they will cost are 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.630
 photographic sheets that theoretically 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.460
 print better now I'm going to show you the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.530
 difference then with them and you 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.840
 we print instead of a normal sheet 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.850
 if we do not print in this, it would be 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.290
 much better would it be then so that 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.980
 catch them if we're in the front row 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.570
 because logically it is if you look at it from 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.220
 near by far it would not be noticed but if 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.350
 you look closely you start noticing the 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.450
 failures the definition of these letters 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.650
 they're a little bad but I tell you if I 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.260
 you do with this now I'm going to teach you 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.570
 it is good, good, what next 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.120
 you need apart from the program 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.860
 computer is an ex tip of these pot 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.680
 and well I will show you here the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.789
 difference between 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.139
 the normal paper in this case this and the 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.850
 laminated paper the role of 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.919
 photography is the one that was taught before 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.740
 you see that it seems more credible then good 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.250
 the only thing we have to do 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.050
 is we cut this we take away the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.150
 sticker to this that we have here with 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.220
 hot water whatever and paste this 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.770
 here, well, I'm going to do it and see 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.780
 how is it 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.150
 well this is the boat as I have 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.860
 bought me according to factory state what 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.210
 bad is that it's another brand and well 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.740
 we will be able to notice the difference but 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.050
 you see the size of the letter more or less 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.230
 a definition that has the good color 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.310
 more or less it 's almost like this 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.090
 and this is the after 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.800
 I have stuck it with glue stick and 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.500
 well you see that like all glue of 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.090
 bar then not stuck but good where 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.460
 is to make very fuse pablo then clear 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.380
 that you can paste it or you have to put it 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.820
 very good anyway to see 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.830
 the minimum teacher will be at a 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.680
 metro and this if you put it like that it's 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.150
 credible and it's a tip is that it works 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.820
 we have not modified it more 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.310
 that the label and you have here the letter 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.700
 in which written here fits a lot 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.380
 information and good I hope you have 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.240
 liked good that has served you more 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.240
 that nothing and this is all for today
