00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.140
 improvisation that I structured for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.410
 controversy of doors to the field but 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.720
 direct that are first part questions 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.700
 that he asks us to each other 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 things that we do not know surprisingly 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.020
 face the second part of each other 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 expressly less than today is 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.259
 one correct since we yearned and that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.349
 we thought I could have a translation 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.690
 theater that has happened and who 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.950
 it's from our vision belongs so 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.620
 He assured that every day the show 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.739
 different that we finished a cançó 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 because we all have a potential 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.840
 musical if little explore but as a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.250
 Brilliant Future 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.160
 as a guitarist we have a song 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.260
 we will try 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.390
 those concepts that is me 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.090
 working at the moment of being clear to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.090
 a town and the third is the questions 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.950
 the audience fills the entrance 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.160
 will ask a question will write the 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.690
 put in an urn and then we 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.380
 we will answer that good me a little 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.090
 vulgar is my fault for the people and 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.240
 There may be a situation of such risk 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.600
 for the comedians because we will have in 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.990
 this life of being able to give a show 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.610
 this power to see comics 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
 that are not in each other to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.470
 pass the ball to play it for 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.810
 fail and be subject to the violence of 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.550

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 stimuli like improvisation is a
