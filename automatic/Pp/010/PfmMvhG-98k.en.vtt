00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
screwed lee experiment and this time

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.799 
screwed lee experiment and this time
we're<00:00:08.220> gonna<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.400> checking<00:00:08.760> out<00:00:08.970> how<00:00:09.389> big<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.630> a

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
we're gonna be checking out how big of a

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.620 
we're gonna be checking out how big of a
cannon<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.620> can<00:00:10.800> make<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.429> big<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> gauge<00:00:11.940> can

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
cannon we can make how big the gauge can

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.419 
cannon we can make how big the gauge can
just<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.679> there<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:13.980> diminishing

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
just get up to there are diminishing

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.570 
just get up to there are diminishing
returns<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.750> question<00:00:16.109> remains<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:17.369> big

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
returns but the question remains how big

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.950 
returns but the question remains how big
will<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.789> get<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.150> there<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> graphical

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
will it get is there like a graphical

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.929 
will it get is there like a graphical
limit<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> how<00:00:19.410> big<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> look<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.520> first<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
limit to how big it a look so first and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000 
limit to how big it a look so first and
foremost<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.570> got<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> build<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.109> cannon<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.619> hang

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
foremost I got to build a cannon so hang

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:50.900 
foremost I got to build a cannon so hang
tight

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.700 

alright<00:00:51.910> ladies<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.300> gentlemen<00:00:52.719> cannon<00:00:53.530> has

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
alright ladies and gentlemen cannon has

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.490 
alright ladies and gentlemen cannon has
been<00:00:53.890> built<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:55.090> what<00:00:55.239> I<00:00:55.269> did<00:00:55.360> was<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:56.019> added<00:00:56.170> one

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
been built so what I did was I added one

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.460 
been built so what I did was I added one
elevation<00:00:56.980> barrel<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.989> thirty<00:00:58.989> motor-driven

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
elevation barrel and thirty motor-driven

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.710 
elevation barrel and thirty motor-driven
barrels<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.220> in<00:01:00.309> 30<00:01:00.550> recoiled<00:01:01.180> barrels<00:01:01.510> which

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
barrels and in 30 recoiled barrels which

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.350 
barrels and in 30 recoiled barrels which
put<00:01:02.019> us<00:01:02.050> at<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.559> perfect<00:01:02.980> 80<00:01:03.250> elevation<00:01:03.909> zero

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
put us at a perfect 80 elevation zero

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.140 
put us at a perfect 80 elevation zero
recoils<00:01:05.050> zero<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.590> accuracy<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.280> means<00:01:06.460> we

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
recoils zero and accuracy that means we

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.240 
recoils zero and accuracy that means we
have<00:01:07.300> no<00:01:07.450> kickback<00:01:07.720> we're<00:01:08.320> 100%<00:01:08.710> accurate

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
have no kickback we're 100% accurate

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.889 
have no kickback we're 100% accurate
right<00:01:09.400> now<00:01:09.580> so<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.119> just<00:01:10.390> want<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.720> make<00:01:10.869> sure

the<00:02:01.119> real<00:02:01.239> test<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:01.750> wanted<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.080> see<00:02:02.259> what

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
the real test we wanted to see what

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.430 
the real test we wanted to see what
gauge<00:02:02.739> increases<00:02:03.399> will<00:02:03.700> do<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.780> this<00:02:05.050> cannon

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
gauge increases will do to this cannon

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.719 
gauge increases will do to this cannon
so<00:02:05.679> let's<00:02:05.860> take<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.069> look

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
so let's take a look

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.770 
so let's take a look
we<00:02:07.239> have<00:02:08.250> 455<00:02:09.250> kinetic<00:02:09.759> damage<00:02:10.179> right<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:10.420> so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
we have 455 kinetic damage right now so

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.240 
we have 455 kinetic damage right now so
that's<00:02:10.869> what<00:02:11.080> we<00:02:11.140> want<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.349> look<00:02:11.470> at<00:02:11.620> because

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
that's what we want to look at because

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
that's what we want to look at because
damage<00:02:13.060> will<00:02:13.209> increase<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:13.780> long<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
damage will increase as long as the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.940 
damage will increase as long as the
gauge<00:02:14.349> increases<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:15.129> working<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.950> let's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
gauge increases are working and let's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.880 
gauge increases are working and let's
just<00:02:18.099> start<00:02:18.250> piling<00:02:18.520> some<00:02:18.879> on<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:22.170> okay<00:02:23.170> it's

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
just start piling some on here okay it's

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.000 
just start piling some on here okay it's
pretty<00:02:24.099> big<00:02:24.310> let's<00:02:24.700> see<00:02:24.849> what<00:02:24.970> we're<00:02:25.090> at<00:02:26.010> 2287

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
pretty big let's see what we're at 2287

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.890 
pretty big let's see what we're at 2287
kinetic<00:02:27.640> damage

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.890 

all<00:02:32.900> right<00:02:33.080> let's<00:02:33.290> take<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.470> look

have stopped so let's remove two sets

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.830 
have stopped so let's remove two sets
and<00:02:57.380> see<00:02:57.560> if<00:02:57.650> we're<00:02:57.800> still<00:02:57.980> at<00:02:58.070> 2607<00:03:01.570> 2605<00:03:02.570> oh

and see if we're still at 2607 2605 oh
look<00:03:03.140> at<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.520> yeah<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.820> think<00:03:04.910> like<00:03:05.300> one<00:03:05.540> more

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
look at that yeah I think like one more

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.980 
look at that yeah I think like one more
and<00:03:06.110> we'll<00:03:06.350> be<00:03:06.380> maxed<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:10.490> here<00:03:11.270> we<00:03:11.360> go<00:03:11.570> twenty

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
and we'll be maxed so here we go twenty

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.910 
and we'll be maxed so here we go twenty
six<00:03:12.170> oh<00:03:12.260> six<00:03:12.560> okay<00:03:14.020> so<00:03:15.020> wait<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.350> minute<00:03:15.710> hang<00:03:15.830> on

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
six oh six okay so wait a minute hang on

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.020 
six oh six okay so wait a minute hang on
let<00:03:16.130> me<00:03:16.160> try<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.490> then<00:03:18.610> let's<00:03:19.610> see<00:03:19.820> if<00:03:19.910> it

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
let me try this then let's see if it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.750 
let me try this then let's see if it
goes<00:03:20.210> higher<00:03:20.630> than<00:03:21.620> twenty<00:03:22.160> six<00:03:22.370> oh<00:03:22.490> seven

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
goes higher than twenty six oh seven

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.220 
goes higher than twenty six oh seven
that<00:03:23.150> would<00:03:23.270> tell<00:03:23.510> us<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.960> still<00:03:24.200> going

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
that would tell us that it's still going

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.010 
that would tell us that it's still going
up<00:03:24.650> 2609<00:03:25.340> alright<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.510> what<00:03:26.690> we're<00:03:26.840> seeing

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
up 2609 alright so what we're seeing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.300 
up 2609 alright so what we're seeing
here<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.590> were<00:03:27.710> seeing<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.130> huge

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
here you were seeing the huge

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.120 
here you were seeing the huge
diminishing<00:03:28.850> returns<00:03:29.440> we<00:03:30.440> can<00:03:30.650> actually<00:03:30.830> keep

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
diminishing returns we can actually keep

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.890 
diminishing returns we can actually keep
increasing<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.790> damage<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.300> now<00:03:32.510> it's<00:03:32.720> so

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
increasing the damage but now it's so

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.740 
increasing the damage but now it's so
minuscule<00:03:33.440> because<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.310> 10%<00:03:34.640> less<00:03:35.240> for

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
minuscule because of the 10% less for

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.560 
minuscule because of the 10% less for
each<00:03:35.900> one<00:03:36.170> that's<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> chain<00:03:37.300> it's<00:03:38.300> not

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
each one that's in a chain it's not

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.540 
each one that's in a chain it's not
really<00:03:38.870> giving<00:03:39.380> us<00:03:39.500> any<00:03:39.740> bonus<00:03:40.070> so<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.400> are

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
really giving us any bonus so we are

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.370 
really giving us any bonus so we are
about<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:40.940> big<00:03:41.150> as<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.570> barrels<00:03:41.900> gonna<00:03:42.050> get

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
about as big as the barrels gonna get

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.730 
about as big as the barrels gonna get
let's<00:03:43.340> try<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.700> out<00:03:43.850> oh<00:03:44.140> look<00:03:45.140> how<00:03:45.290> slow<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.680> is

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
let's try it out oh look how slow it is

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.280 
let's try it out oh look how slow it is
raising<00:03:46.510> let's<00:03:47.510> see<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:47.900> still<00:03:49.959> wow<00:03:50.959> look

to top it off so that feels like you
know<00:03:59.480> at<00:04:00.380> some<00:04:00.650> point<00:04:00.709> here<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.310> we<00:04:01.580> started<00:04:02.090> it

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
know at some point here we we started it

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.090 
know at some point here we we started it
just<00:04:02.660> became<00:04:02.930> pointless<00:04:03.500> let's<00:04:03.709> see<00:04:03.830> how<00:04:03.950> many

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
just became pointless let's see how many

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.069 
just became pointless let's see how many
we<00:04:04.280> added<00:04:04.580> on<00:04:04.700> here<00:04:05.110> let's<00:04:06.110> see

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.690 

that's<00:04:10.079> about<00:04:10.319> 10<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.860> bet<00:04:11.159> I<00:04:11.310> bet<00:04:11.519> we<00:04:11.610> have

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
that's about 10 I bet I bet we have

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.399 
that's about 10 I bet I bet we have
somewhere<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.150> range<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.569> like<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.930> hundred

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
somewhere in the range of like a hundred

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.039 
somewhere in the range of like a hundred
right<00:04:13.590> now<00:04:14.180> certainly<00:04:15.180> somewhere<00:04:15.510> between<00:04:15.659> 80

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
right now certainly somewhere between 80

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.699 
right now certainly somewhere between 80
and<00:04:16.169> 90<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:17.039> sure<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:19.199> didn't<00:04:19.590> feel<00:04:19.650> like

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
and 90 for sure I just didn't feel like

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.039 
and 90 for sure I just didn't feel like
counting<00:04:20.039> them<00:04:20.130> all<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:21.389> know<00:04:21.419> that's
