00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
there was nothing about it that seemed

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.110 
there was nothing about it that seemed
out<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.980> ordinary<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.459> know<00:02:25.610> as<00:02:25.819> far<00:02:26.000> as

crop<00:02:26.270> circles<00:02:26.660> go<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.830> seems<00:02:28.040> pretty<00:02:28.280> basic

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
crop circles go it seems pretty basic

and<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:29.060> kind<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.300> begs<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.750> question<00:02:30.200> you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
