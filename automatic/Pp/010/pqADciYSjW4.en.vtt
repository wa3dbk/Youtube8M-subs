engagement and to leadership as well I
think<00:00:31.720> there's<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.169> couple<00:00:32.469> of<00:00:32.529> key<00:00:32.829> things<00:00:32.859> in

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
think there's a couple of key things in

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.549 
think there's a couple of key things in
this<00:00:33.640> this<00:00:34.089> PowerPoint<00:00:34.809> that<00:00:35.079> that<00:00:35.409> we

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
this this PowerPoint that that we

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.239 
this this PowerPoint that that we
explore<00:00:36.100> one<00:00:37.059> is<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.449> concept<00:00:38.109> of

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
explore one is the concept of

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:41.579 
explore one is the concept of
interruption<00:00:39.480> schools<00:00:40.480> are<00:00:40.659> places<00:00:41.079> that<00:00:41.109> are

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
interruption schools are places that are

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.619 
interruption schools are places that are
very<00:00:41.980> typical<00:00:42.219> if<00:00:42.760> we<00:00:42.909> walk<00:00:43.120> into<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.449> school

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
very typical if we walk into a school

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.930 
very typical if we walk into a school
anywhere<00:00:44.260> it's<00:00:44.620> easy<00:00:44.979> to<00:00:45.190> tell<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.550> it's<00:00:45.760> a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
anywhere it's easy to tell that it's a

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.669 
anywhere it's easy to tell that it's a
school<00:00:46.300> because<00:00:46.719> of<00:00:46.749> the<00:00:46.899> way<00:00:47.079> it<00:00:47.229> looks<00:00:47.260> and

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
school because of the way it looks and

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.750 
school because of the way it looks and
the<00:00:47.739> kinds<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.069> things<00:00:48.129> that<00:00:48.460> we<00:00:48.550> see

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
the kinds of things that we see

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.939 
the kinds of things that we see
happening<00:00:48.940> there<00:00:49.479> as<00:00:50.019> we<00:00:50.229> begin<00:00:50.499> to<00:00:50.649> think<00:00:50.859> of

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
happening there as we begin to think of

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.369 
happening there as we begin to think of
a<00:00:51.039> place<00:00:51.339> for<00:00:51.699> parents<00:00:52.239> on<00:00:52.329> school<00:00:52.719> landscapes

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
a place for parents on school landscapes

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.739 
a place for parents on school landscapes
it<00:00:53.739> becomes<00:00:54.370> important<00:00:54.999> to<00:00:55.059> interrupt<00:00:55.690> that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
it becomes important to interrupt that

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.139 
it becomes important to interrupt that
old<00:00:56.079> story<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.829> school<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.370> typical<00:00:57.819> one<00:00:57.999> we

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
old story of school the typical one we

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.569 
old story of school the typical one we
all<00:00:58.299> know<00:00:58.329> so<00:00:58.780> well<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.229> put<00:00:59.799> a<00:00:59.829> new<00:01:00.039> story<00:01:00.429> in

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
all know so well and put a new story in

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.629 
all know so well and put a new story in
its<00:01:00.760> place<00:01:01.120> with<00:01:01.899> this<00:01:02.109> work<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:03.069> found<00:01:03.339> that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
its place with this work we found that

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.850 
its place with this work we found that
the<00:01:03.789> key<00:01:04.089> one<00:01:04.690> of<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.900> key<00:01:05.110> aspects<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.800> that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the key one of the key aspects of that

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.270 
the key one of the key aspects of that
is<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.720> start<00:01:07.720> by<00:01:07.990> looking<00:01:08.320> at<00:01:08.650> ourselves

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
is to start by looking at ourselves

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.250 
is to start by looking at ourselves
rather<00:01:09.520> than<00:01:09.640> looking<00:01:10.060> outward<00:01:10.510> at<00:01:10.690> parents

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
rather than looking outward at parents

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.040 
rather than looking outward at parents
so<00:01:12.010> often<00:01:12.340> when<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.610> talk<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.880> educators<00:01:13.630> they

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
so often when we talk to educators they

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.680 
so often when we talk to educators they
will<00:01:14.260> say<00:01:14.650> these<00:01:15.490> parents<00:01:15.940> don't<00:01:16.180> care<00:01:16.420> if

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
will say these parents don't care if

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.020 
will say these parents don't care if
only<00:01:17.110> these<00:01:17.290> parents<00:01:17.770> would<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.370> there's<00:01:18.970> a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
only these parents would and there's a

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.790 
only these parents would and there's a
lot<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> judgments<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.050> assumptions<00:01:20.560> made

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
lot of judgments and assumptions made

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.020 
lot of judgments and assumptions made
about<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.160> parents<00:01:21.520> with<00:01:21.670> whom<00:01:21.700> they're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
about the parents with whom they're

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.090 
about the parents with whom they're
working<00:01:22.480> what<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.470> found<00:01:23.680> in<00:01:23.920> our<00:01:24.040> research

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
working what we found in our research

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.310 
working what we found in our research
was<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.700> really<00:01:25.210> critical<00:01:25.720> piece<00:01:25.900> was<00:01:26.110> to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
was the really critical piece was to

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.050 
was the really critical piece was to
look<00:01:26.470> inward<00:01:26.830> at<00:01:26.980> our<00:01:27.130> own<00:01:27.280> assumptions<00:01:27.880> and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
look inward at our own assumptions and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.420 
look inward at our own assumptions and
beliefs<00:01:28.390> how<00:01:28.930> do<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.200> see<00:01:29.410> parents<00:01:29.860> are<00:01:30.190> we

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
beliefs how do we see parents are we

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.580 
beliefs how do we see parents are we
working<00:01:30.880> from<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.210> strength-based<00:01:31.780> model<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
working from a strength-based model and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.400 
working from a strength-based model and
how<00:01:32.980> do<00:01:33.040> we<00:01:33.160> imagine<00:01:33.690> living<00:01:34.690> alongside<00:01:34.960> them

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
how do we imagine living alongside them

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
how do we imagine living alongside them
in<00:01:35.440> new<00:01:35.710> ways<00:01:35.980> we<00:01:36.640> also<00:01:36.790> explore<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:38.080> need<00:01:38.290> for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
in new ways we also explore the need for

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.100 
in new ways we also explore the need for
invitation<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.580> hospitality<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.660> begin<00:01:40.960> to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
invitation and hospitality to begin to

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.780 
invitation and hospitality to begin to
think<00:01:41.320> about<00:01:41.590> inviting<00:01:41.950> parents<00:01:42.250> into<00:01:42.670> our

think about inviting parents into our

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.970 
think about inviting parents into our
schools<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.360> new<00:01:43.540> ways<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.140> have<00:01:44.560> parents

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
schools in new ways to have parents

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.070 
schools in new ways to have parents
invite<00:01:45.700> each<00:01:45.850> other<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.360> become<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.720> part<00:01:47.020> of

invite each other to become a part of

invite each other to become a part of
the<00:01:47.230> community<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.700> build<00:01:48.910> trust<00:01:49.180> and

relationships with parents that's work

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.720 
relationships with parents that's work
that<00:01:51.850> takes<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:53.110> lot<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:53.890> listening<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.490> lot<00:01:54.670> of
