here<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.430> firing<00:01:02.850> range<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:04.460> really<00:01:05.460> like

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
here on firing range I really like

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.520 
here on firing range I really like
firing<00:01:06.150> range<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.780> too<00:01:06.900> big<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.380> small

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
firing range it's not too big or small

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.990 
firing range it's not too big or small
or<00:01:07.860> anything<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.729> perfect

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
or anything like that it's just perfect

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
or anything like that it's just perfect
size<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.390> stuff<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.860> she<00:01:11.010> said<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
size and stuff that's what she said but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
size and stuff that's what she said but
um<00:01:12.030> anyway<00:01:12.900> since<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> super<00:01:14.130> bowl<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
um anyway since the super bowl is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.940 
um anyway since the super bowl is
underway<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.360> guess<00:01:15.900> when<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.710> will<00:01:16.920> be

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
underway I guess when it will be

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.249 
underway I guess when it will be
underway<00:01:17.310> when<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> video<00:01:17.850> goes<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.210> who<00:01:19.140> do

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
underway when this video goes up who do

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.740 
underway when this video goes up who do
you<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> win<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.600> video

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you think is going to win if the video

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
you think is going to win if the video
is<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.140> before<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> end<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.890> don't<00:01:23.040> even<00:01:23.130> know

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is up before the end I don't even know

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
is up before the end I don't even know
this<00:01:23.430> could<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.299> relevant<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
this could be really relevant if the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.230 
this could be really relevant if the
game<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.590> already<00:01:25.740> over<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.549> believe<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
game is already over but I believe this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
game is already over but I believe this
will<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.659> before<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.530> don't<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
will go out before so I don't really I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
will go out before so I don't really I
don't<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.630> who's<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> win<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
don't really know who's going to win I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
don't really know who's going to win I
don't<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> favorite<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.970> will

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
