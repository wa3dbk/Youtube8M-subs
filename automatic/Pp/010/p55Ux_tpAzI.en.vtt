00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.209
 the herpetario of the faculty of sciences 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.390
 of the unam has been for more than 35 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.920
 years a learning observation site 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.040
 and preservation of animal species 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.679
 gathered in one place because of the 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.600
 under budget the herpetrator survives 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.360
 for volunteering and donations of 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.100
 other faculties thanks to this funge 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.590
 as a site that protects species 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.810
 endemic animals hurt and in 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.910
 danger of extinction its permanence 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.190
 contributes to research projects 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 and teaching the herpetario is about to 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.629
 be demolished without it still being disclosed 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 an adequate relocation within the 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.429
 faculty jeopardizing the continuity of the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.079
 shelter of various species 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.120
 academic obligations with 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.630
 students and diffusion work 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.850
 that you have with the public 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.710
 It is the first contact you have and not 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.150
 you only need to prevent it from 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.760
 close this place it is convenient 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.110
 that the students in general know what 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.180
 that can be faced in the exits of 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.980
 field if they decide to move it without their 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.720
 authorization would be falling in a 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.720
 legal crime not a crime 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.960
 I'm a retired academic teacher from the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.600
 medical school I'm a taxi driver 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.010
 herpetario of the faculties and we 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 we are doing a statistical study 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.850
 for our statistics class on 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.400
 the sexual dimorphism that exists in the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.140
 turtles of the park genre mya no longer 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.660
 we have to be biologists to conserve in 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.190
 jars in sitting in a laboratory not 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.409
 you have to keep what is there and I think that 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.119
 this is a way of learning and I have 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.619
 been working on snakes since 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.560
 we have enough years are cut 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.160
 snakes and it's the only place like that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.490
 really in this road that transmits to 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.720
 the students many factors 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.370
 important 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.490
 a subject is taught right here 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.280
 optional then the teaching is at 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.410
 a hundred then I took the handling stuff 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.940
 of amphibians and reptiles in captivity and 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.530
 has been one of the subjects that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.390
 I think I taught more things in the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 career because learning you get 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.780
 here is practical is applicable 100% and not 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.370
 you learn only from books not if you already 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.860
 you have these specimens here is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.690
 important that they continue to take us away 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520
 a tool to field trips 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.040
 It is highly recommended that you have that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.880
 basic information that will form them 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.290
 as future experimental biologists in 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.090
 the field area 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.430
 this collection is made of animals 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.160
 that they arrive that are hurt that this 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.930
 and will not be pushed back or 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.690
 seizures of the week or the prophecy 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.540
 they have an impressive diversity 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.740
 right now he has been entering and they have 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.310
 lizards from different parts of the world 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.660
 they have obviously all the snakes 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.270
 from here the ecological reserve of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.000
 pedregal of san angel and is a very good 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.020
 living collection that allows you to meet 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.540
 These animals 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.150
 -secretary has many specimens 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.209
 around 70 specimens 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.519
 this genre we can do with 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 ease the study of differences if 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.970
 we went to the field because it would cost us 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.870
 a lot of work being sampled and is 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.989
 coming back and we have to recognize that the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.760
 This unit has a function 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.370
 vital importance all the people who 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.769
 work here we have taken courses of 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.079
 basic support first aid 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.299
 we train firefighters we train 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.340
 gardeners because here in the reserve of 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.650
 rattlesnakes not then by 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.379
 that part of security at all times 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.180
 there are trained people trained to 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.650
 attend an accident the arguments that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.680
 are giving and that there is not an action that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.690
 you have humanly the animals do not 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.129
 there are animals that arrive here injured that 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.840
 They bring them because they no longer want houses 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.400
 because they are very large and they can see 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.079
 the specimens are healthy even 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.569
 reproduce right here would be a 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.799
 unfortunately that the animals died 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.200
 in a transfer I feel that they are animals 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.620
 very valuable I think it would be a 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.709
 lost 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.780
 well now that irreparable for the 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.780
 faculty and in general for 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.140
 I am very proud to be from the unam 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.370
 but decisions like these make me 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.620
 feel that they really are not 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.079
 worried about getting people out 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.790
 best possible participants participate 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.040
 actively in actions that are not said 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.979
 the professor but of such a researcher 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.669
 full time who has fought for 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.669
 problems 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.910
 and simply that they reconsider and that 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.500
 really get informed of the function that 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.930
 this unit of service has as such 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.400
 volume and participate because the time 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.880
 of the opportunity to take this matter 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.800
 is unique and should take advantage of it and should 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.479
 of preventing this place from closing 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.250
 that they can still have a 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.300
 opportunity like this to take out so much 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.300
 learning from this place 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.440
 and
