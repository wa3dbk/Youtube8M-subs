00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.979
 mall computing 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.419

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.100
 in addition length 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100

 the man in the photo 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.180
 because if you are not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.890
