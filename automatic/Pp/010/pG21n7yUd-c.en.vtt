and<00:00:06.150> here's<00:00:06.450> what<00:00:06.629> you're<00:00:06.779> doing<00:00:07.020> right<00:00:07.230> that

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and here's what you're doing right that

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.839 
and here's what you're doing right that
you<00:00:07.770> don't<00:00:07.919> need<00:00:08.040> help<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.700> are

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
you don't need help with is that you are

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.390 
you don't need help with is that you are
looking<00:00:09.030> at<00:00:09.360> something<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.469> complex

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
looking at something that is so complex

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
looking at something that is so complex
and<00:00:11.639> organic<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> counterintuitive

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and organic that it is counterintuitive

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.230 
and organic that it is counterintuitive
to<00:00:13.889> most<00:00:14.130> people<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> turn<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:14.940> something

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
to most people to turn it into something

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.830 
to most people to turn it into something
so<00:00:15.570> mechanical<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> planed<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.760> wind<00:00:18.119> for

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
so mechanical and planed up you wind for

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.260 
so mechanical and planed up you wind for
planes<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.800> much<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.490> went<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.850> forms<00:00:21.119> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
planes as much as you went for forms I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.320 
planes as much as you went for forms I
can<00:00:21.570> tell<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.920> thought<00:00:23.460> through<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:23.970> form

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
can tell this is thought through as form

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
can tell this is thought through as form
I<00:00:24.390> cannot<00:00:24.779> tell<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.920> thought

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
I cannot tell that this is thought

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.519 
I cannot tell that this is thought
through<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.550> form<00:00:27.000> yeah<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.320> means

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
through as form yeah and all this means

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.410 
through as form yeah and all this means
is<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.070> go<00:00:29.340> back<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> simplest

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
is that we go back to the simplest

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.669 
is that we go back to the simplest
things<00:00:30.570> let's<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> head<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.380> example

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
things let's take the head for example

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.380 
things let's take the head for example
if<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.949> know<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.160> sure<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.940> head<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
if we know for sure that this head is a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020 
if we know for sure that this head is a
box<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.989> head<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.860> box<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.610> this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
box now that head could be a box in this

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.049 
box now that head could be a box in this
position<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.290> could<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.950> box<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.910> would

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
position or it could be a box this would

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.310 
position or it could be a box this would
be<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> front<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.690> we'd<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.110> from

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
be the front so we'd have that from

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
be the front so we'd have that from
there<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.890> could<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.340> seems<00:00:41.820> more

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
there it could and it seems more

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
there it could and it seems more
sensible<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> make<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> box<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
sensible to make this a box in a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.979 
sensible to make this a box in a
position<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.480> drawing<00:00:45.780> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
position like this now I'm drawing this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
position like this now I'm drawing this
box<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.559> two<00:00:46.980> separate<00:00:47.340> positions<00:00:47.730> they

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
box in two separate positions they

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
box in two separate positions they
certainly<00:00:48.329> aren't<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> same<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.410> reason

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
certainly aren't the same and the reason

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
certainly aren't the same and the reason
I<00:00:49.770> chose<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.780> be

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I chose this one down here to be

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.450 
I chose this one down here to be
pointing<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.129> trying<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pointing down is that I'm trying to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
pointing down is that I'm trying to
figure<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.270> an<00:00:54.449> axis<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
figure that there is an axis of this

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
figure that there is an axis of this
thing<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.280> looks<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.640> its<00:00:56.789> face<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.300> pointing

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
thing it looks like its face is pointing

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.270 
thing it looks like its face is pointing
that<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.350> when<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> looked<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that way and so when I looked at that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
that way and so when I looked at that
axis<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.059> saw<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> direction<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
axis I saw that the direction in that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.110 
axis I saw that the direction in that
the<00:01:02.160> thing<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.430> pointing<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the thing is pointing would be the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.140 
the thing is pointing would be the
direction<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.960> z<00:01:04.439> line<00:01:05.159> okay<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:05.939> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
direction of my z line okay so because I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
direction of my z line okay so because I
saw<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.720> line<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.229> line<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.890> line

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
saw that this line this line this line

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
saw that this line this line this line
sort<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> aiming<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.540> helped<00:01:09.810> me

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
sort of aiming down there that helped me

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
sort of aiming down there that helped me
with<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> Z<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.680> X<00:01:10.890> X<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.310> no<00:01:11.460> problem<00:01:11.850> X

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
with a Z what about X X is no problem X

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
with a Z what about X X is no problem X
is<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.479> off<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:13.020> width<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.530> pretty

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
is going off that way width is pretty

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
is going off that way width is pretty
clear<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> pretty<00:01:14.790> consistent<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.540> mine<00:01:15.750> is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
clear and pretty consistent now mine is

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
clear and pretty consistent now mine is
not<00:01:16.049> white<00:01:16.350> tip<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.340> okay<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.759> if

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
not white tip that way that's okay we if

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.340 
not white tip that way that's okay we if
you're<00:01:18.090> drawing<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.689> fix<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.170> tip

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you're drawing it you can fix it and tip

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.690 
you're drawing it you can fix it and tip
it<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.860> more<00:01:20.009> consistent<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.640> also

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it so that it's more consistent and also

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
it so that it's more consistent and also
not<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.299> exaggerated<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> wide-angle

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
not so exaggerated with a wide-angle

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
not so exaggerated with a wide-angle
lens<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:23.640> why<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.150> saying<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.630> Marshall

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
lens now why are you saying use Marshall

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
lens now why are you saying use Marshall
watch<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.460> corner<00:01:26.759> here<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
watch this see this corner here see this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.170 
watch this see this corner here see this
corner<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.439> those<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.400> supposed<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
corner here those are supposed to be the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
corner here those are supposed to be the
same<00:01:30.360> corner<00:01:30.890> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> X<00:01:32.220> line<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
same corner on the X line you got the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.130 
same corner on the X line you got the
idea<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.210> they're<00:01:33.329> pointing<00:01:33.630> down<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
idea and they're pointing down like that

here those are supposed to be I'm making
it<00:01:38.369> worse<00:01:38.520> than<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> did<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.659> trying

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it worse than you did it but I'm trying

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.679 
it worse than you did it but I'm trying
to<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> point<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.820> consistency

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to make the point that the consistency

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
to make the point that the consistency
of<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.140> these<00:01:43.229> line<00:01:43.439> systems<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:44.009> mixed

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of some of these line systems got mixed

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850 
of some of these line systems got mixed
up<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.880> solution<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
up and the solution for that is to so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.899 
up and the solution for that is to so
embed<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.329> process<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.680> let's<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> box

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
embed the process of this let's do a box

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
embed the process of this let's do a box
that<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:51.630> contain<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.560> animal's<00:01:53.070> head<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that would contain this animal's head in

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.819 
that would contain this animal's head in
say<00:01:54.030> three<00:01:54.299> different<00:01:54.720> positions<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.619> one

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
say three different positions this one

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.050 
say three different positions this one
which<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.280> sort<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> first<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
which was sort of like the first one I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.490 
which was sort of like the first one I
did<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.420> gonna<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> front<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.320> one

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
did that's gonna be the front this one

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.929 
did that's gonna be the front this one
which<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.979> all<00:01:59.189> we're<00:01:59.340> doing<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.909> just

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
which is all we're doing here is just

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.760 
which is all we're doing here is just
pretty<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.390> tipping<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.990> thing<00:02:01.229> down<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
pretty much tipping this thing down and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
pretty much tipping this thing down and
revealing<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.820> top<00:02:03.149> plane<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
revealing more of that top plane that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
revealing more of that top plane that
I've<00:02:03.689> got<00:02:03.840> an<00:02:03.960> X<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.649> means<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I've got an X on which means that this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.920 
I've got an X on which means that this
plane<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.579> gonna<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.969> facing<00:02:06.180> down<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
plane is gonna be facing down more the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
plane is gonna be facing down more the
one<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.170> has<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.320> O<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.459> there<00:02:09.000> I've<00:02:09.090> got

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
one that has the O on it there I've got

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850 
one that has the O on it there I've got
I've<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.110> another<00:02:10.229> position<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I've got this in another position and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.290 
I've got this in another position and
then<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> third<00:02:11.910> position

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
then I can do it in a third position

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
then I can do it in a third position
let's<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> it's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
let's do it so that it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.670 
let's do it so that it's
animal<00:02:14.190> moves<00:02:14.400> its<00:02:14.610> head<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.230> so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
animal moves its head up a bit and so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.860 
animal moves its head up a bit and so
the<00:02:16.860> Oh<00:02:16.890> would<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.520> right<00:02:17.790> here<00:02:17.820> now<00:02:18.510> those<00:02:18.690> are

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the Oh would be right here now those are

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.030 
the Oh would be right here now those are
three<00:02:19.110> different<00:02:19.380> positions<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
three different positions for the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.330 
three different positions for the
animal's<00:02:20.340> head<00:02:20.460> now<00:02:20.820> when<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.530> part<00:02:23.070> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
animal's head now when we have a part to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.690 
animal's head now when we have a part to
carve<00:02:23.820> out<00:02:24.030> or<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> part<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.350> project<00:02:26.070> let's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
carve out or a part to project let's

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.190 
carve out or a part to project let's
just<00:02:26.940> say<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:27.570> muzzle<00:02:27.930> on

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
just say there's a little muzzle on

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.740 
just say there's a little muzzle on
there<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.370> put<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
there and we can put that on there and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.230 
there and we can put that on there and
then<00:02:31.080> pull<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.590> out<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.130> far<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.790> everything

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
then pull it out this far and everything

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.230 
then pull it out this far and everything
stays<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.800> consistent<00:02:35.430> say<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.880> that's<00:02:35.970> sort

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
stays so consistent say but that's sort

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.580 
stays so consistent say but that's sort
of<00:02:36.270> like<00:02:36.330> what<00:02:36.570> an<00:02:36.660> engineer<00:02:37.050> does<00:02:37.110> that's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
of like what an engineer does that's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.510 
of like what an engineer does that's
sort<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.800> like<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.100> person<00:02:38.310> who<00:02:38.400> designs

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
sort of like what a person who designs

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.730 
sort of like what a person who designs
an<00:02:38.820> automobile<00:02:39.390> does<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.930> don't<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.530> how<00:02:40.620> much

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
an automobile does I don't know how much

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.130 
an automobile does I don't know how much
that's<00:02:40.950> gonna<00:02:41.010> help<00:02:41.220> me<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.520> draw<00:02:41.730> animals<00:02:42.330> it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
that's gonna help me to draw animals it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.420 
that's gonna help me to draw animals it
will<00:02:43.560> help<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.730> draw<00:02:45.260> everything<00:02:46.430> because

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
will help you to draw everything because

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.630 
will help you to draw everything because
when<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.660> more<00:02:48.900> sophisticated

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
when you get to the more sophisticated

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.370 
when you get to the more sophisticated
forms<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.910> are<00:02:51.090> organic<00:02:51.510> let's<00:02:52.050> do<00:02:52.230> this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
forms that are organic let's do this

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.380 
forms that are organic let's do this
foot<00:02:52.650> let's<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> close-up<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.330> that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
foot let's just do a close-up of that

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.030 
foot let's just do a close-up of that
we've<00:02:54.840> got<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> four<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:55.320> coming<00:02:55.590> toward<00:02:55.860> us

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
we've got a four I'm coming toward us

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.010 
we've got a four I'm coming toward us
notice<00:02:56.670> I'm<00:02:56.820> thinking<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> as<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
notice I'm thinking of it as the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.260 
notice I'm thinking of it as the
simplest<00:02:58.590> thing<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.220> that's<00:02:59.489> precise<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
simplest thing I can that's precise the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.820 
simplest thing I can that's precise the
simplest<00:03:00.570> thing<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.750> can<00:03:00.900> think<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:01.770> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
simplest thing I can think of it as a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.350 
simplest thing I can think of it as a
piece<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.220> French<00:03:02.370> bread<00:03:02.459> there<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.150> coming

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
piece of French bread there it's coming

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.150 
piece of French bread there it's coming
toward<00:03:03.570> me<00:03:03.600> but<00:03:03.870> that's<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.530> also<00:03:04.980> not

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
toward me but that's so that's also not

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.260 
toward me but that's so that's also not
the<00:03:05.310> simplest<00:03:05.610> thing<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.090> keep<00:03:06.209> track

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
the simplest thing that I can keep track

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.090 
the simplest thing that I can keep track
and<00:03:06.720> make<00:03:06.870> precise<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.410> soon<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.709> switch<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
and make precise as soon as I switch to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.680 
and make precise as soon as I switch to
straight<00:03:08.340> lines<00:03:08.550> when<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.000> doubt<00:03:09.120> always<00:03:09.420> go

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
straight lines when in doubt always go

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.940 
straight lines when in doubt always go
for<00:03:10.020> straight<00:03:10.230> lines<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:10.590> straight

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
for straight lines because straight

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.040 
for straight lines because straight
lines<00:03:11.190> force<00:03:11.670> precision<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.660> has<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.020> be

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
lines force precision now it has to be

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.810 
lines force precision now it has to be
correct<00:03:13.560> or<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.890> look<00:03:14.100> wrong<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.730> have

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
correct or to look wrong and I just have

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
correct or to look wrong and I just have
to<00:03:14.910> keep<00:03:15.000> practicing<00:03:15.090> until<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.630> get<00:03:15.750> that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
to keep practicing until I get that

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.160 
to keep practicing until I get that
right

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
right

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.810 
right
now<00:03:16.380> let's<00:03:16.590> take<00:03:16.830> let's<00:03:17.130> take<00:03:17.250> one<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.700> these

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
now let's take let's take one of these

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
now let's take let's take one of these
things<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.780> set<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.230> toes<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:20.070> a

things with set of toes if you have a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.280 
things with set of toes if you have a
set<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.400> toes<00:03:20.640> watch<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.480> now<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:21.989> are<00:03:22.140> not

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
set of toes watch this now they are not

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
set of toes watch this now they are not
going<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:23.040> facing<00:03:23.250> toward<00:03:23.670> me<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.880> see

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
this one of them may go out like so with

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.500 
this one of them may go out like so with
a<00:03:31.920> very<00:03:32.400> foreshortened

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
a very foreshortened

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.080 
a very foreshortened

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
top plane and when you have a claw

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.699 
top plane and when you have a claw
coming<00:03:36.660> out<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.019> one's<00:03:37.200> gonna<00:03:37.320> be<00:03:37.470> going

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
coming out that one's gonna be going

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.750 
coming out that one's gonna be going
more<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> side<00:03:38.160> now<00:03:38.340> watch<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.610> watch

more to the side now watch this watch
this<00:03:38.820> next<00:03:39.120> one<00:03:39.239> when<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.690> clock

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
this next one when you have a clock

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.240 
this next one when you have a clock
coming<00:03:40.290> toward<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.739> it's<00:03:40.920> going<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.160> be

coming toward you it's going to be

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.530 
coming toward you it's going to be
coming<00:03:41.489> more<00:03:41.610> towards<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.180> have<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.330> claw

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
coming more towards you you have a claw

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.910 
coming more towards you you have a claw
coming<00:03:43.019> toward<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:43.530> way<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.830> it's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
coming toward you this way and it's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.470 
coming toward you this way and it's
coming<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.220> Morgan<00:03:44.459> toward<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.360> see

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
coming to Morgan toward you that you see

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.900 
coming to Morgan toward you that you see
all<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.650> looks<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.580> is

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
all of that that looks like this is

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.840 
all of that that looks like this is
coming<00:03:48.630> at<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.989> 3d<00:03:49.440> all<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.860> organic<00:03:50.280> stuff

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
coming at you 3d all that organic stuff

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.610 
coming at you 3d all that organic stuff
came<00:03:51.269> from<00:03:51.299> an<00:03:51.570> awareness<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:52.140> three<00:03:52.470> boxes

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
came from an awareness of three boxes

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.470 
came from an awareness of three boxes
and<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:53.340> don't<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.880> awareness<00:03:53.970> we

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
and if we don't have that awareness we

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.360 
and if we don't have that awareness we
may<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> great<00:03:55.140> eye<00:03:55.170> we<00:03:55.650> may<00:03:55.769> get<00:03:55.920> lucky<00:03:55.950> on

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
may have a great eye we may get lucky on

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.949 
may have a great eye we may get lucky on
things<00:03:56.670> but<00:03:57.090> we<00:03:57.239> don't<00:03:57.390> have<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.540> control

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
things but we don't have the control

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.170 
things but we don't have the control
over<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:58.920> do<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.100> we<00:03:59.160> go<00:03:59.280> for<00:03:59.400> number

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
over it that we do if we go for number

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.170 
over it that we do if we go for number
birch<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.750> want<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> mention
