explanation<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.750> votes<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.710> my

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
explanation because the votes on the my

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.040 
explanation because the votes on the my
video<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.340> made<00:00:20.550> previously<00:00:20.820> were<00:00:21.689> fairly

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
video that I made previously were fairly

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
video that I made previously were fairly
even<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.310> actually<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> leaders<00:00:24.180> were<00:00:24.359> not

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
even and actually the leaders were not

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.470 
even and actually the leaders were not
the<00:00:24.660> Cavs<00:00:24.900> they<00:00:25.260> were<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> kings<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.760> reason

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the Cavs they were the kings the reason

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.019 
the Cavs they were the kings the reason
that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.660> picked<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> Cavaliers<00:00:28.699> was<00:00:29.699> mainly

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that I picked the Cavaliers was mainly

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
that I picked the Cavaliers was mainly
because<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.410> Kings<00:00:31.679> already<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.250> their

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
because the Kings already have their

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389 
because the Kings already have their
nucleus<00:00:32.910> set<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.809> there<00:00:34.710> wouldn't<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.100> be

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
nucleus set up there wouldn't really be

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
nucleus set up there wouldn't really be
that<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.730> work<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.480> their<00:00:36.780> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
don't have it so I'm try to do this as

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
don't have it so I'm try to do this as
legit<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.829> possible<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.329> these

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
legit as possible so as you see these

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.760 
legit as possible so as you see these
players<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:45.990> throwing<00:01:46.170> away<00:01:46.350> aren't

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
players that I'm throwing away aren't

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.359 
players that I'm throwing away aren't
really<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.280> important<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:49.590> okay<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
really that important so it's okay so it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.719 
really that important so it's okay so it
all<00:01:50.490> works<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:51.170> anyways<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.950> Cavs<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> really

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
all works out anyways the Cavs I really

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
all works out anyways the Cavs I really
think<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.409> best<00:01:55.590> team<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
think that they're the best team to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859 
think that they're the best team to
rebuild<00:01:56.369> even<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.850> magic<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> magic<00:01:57.450> was

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
rebuild even the magic the magic was

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
rebuild even the magic the magic was
probably<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:58.860> third<00:01:59.070> place<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
probably that was third place in the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.209 
probably that was third place in the
votes<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.840> magic<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.890> even

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
votes and the magic you know when even

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
votes and the magic you know when even
if<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.460> traded<00:02:02.820> Dwight<00:02:03.180> Howard<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
if it traded Dwight Howard because that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.940 
if it traded Dwight Howard because that
would<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:03.960> been<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.170> scenario<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> wanted<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
would have been the scenario I wanted to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.600 
would have been the scenario I wanted to
play<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.360> was<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:07.619> trade<00:02:07.920> Dwight<00:02:08.280> Howard

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
play out was to trade Dwight Howard

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.070 
play out was to trade Dwight Howard
because<00:02:08.819> he<00:02:08.970> wanted<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.360> traded<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
because he wanted to be traded get a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.600 
because he wanted to be traded get a
bunch<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.319> assets<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> rebuild<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> team

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.860 
bunch of assets and rebuild the team
from<00:02:11.730> there<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.239> when<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.599> about<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
from there but when you think about it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.790 
from there but when you think about it

Thompson I just think the Cavaliers is a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.570 
Thompson I just think the Cavaliers is a
good<00:02:40.110> option<00:02:40.290> they<00:02:40.620> deserve<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.190> rebuilt

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
