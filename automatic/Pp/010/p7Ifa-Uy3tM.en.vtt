00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 do not 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.880
 how about friends how are they in this 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.460
 I'm going to teach you how to do these 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.430
 easy earrings that are filigree and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.470
 what are you going to be able to do with the earrings 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.230
 that you have what you missed and 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.390
 you have one piece left, those are going to be 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.400
 what you will be able to use and the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 materials that we will need are 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.940
 we're going to need two strips these are from 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.520
 Size of plus or minus 1 to 2 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.310
 centimeters depends on the size that you 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.730
 go to love all your earrings too 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.670
 another strip half a centimeter wide and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.240
 a pair of scissors we will also need 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.110
 silicon resistol either white or 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.150
 bar and this these earrings that you already 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 good in this case that I already stopped 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.460
 use because I missed the other pair 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.900
 we're going to need the back of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.630
 these earrings 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.880
 now we will begin we will take our 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.450
 pull 2 centimeters and we're going to put you 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.350
 resistol and we will stick it with the other one 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 make a much longer strip 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 since we hit well we're going to take 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.360
 our scissors and we're going to cut well 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.479
 this way we're going to do like a few 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.509
 cuts so tiny throughout this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.000
 strip without reaching the end 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.190
 leaving it still united let's say it like that and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.530
 we will cut as well as if we were 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.049
 cutting making a little skirt let's say it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 well since we did all that we'll do the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.549
 same step that we always do with the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.159
 filigree that will be coiled or rolled 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.259
 our paper so we are going to roll it up 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.649
 everything and we're going to match so they're 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.090
 to the same size ok so that it is not going to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.940
 leave the strip 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.250
 and from there we will hit it in this way 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.610
 since we hit like this now let's look 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.470
 the center of our of our figure and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.280
 let's start doing like that to the wings 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.680
 bandages to make it look and crush more 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.680
 since we did it well now what 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.319
 we will leave and we will take our strip the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.569
 skinny that is going to be the center and let's go 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.000
 to roll up like we do with the 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.910
 filigree if you do not know how below I leave you 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.370
 videos of how to do it because there are more 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.980
 figures that you can use already from there 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.500
 we will stick with resistol and what follows 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.250
 will be put resistol in the middle and paste 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.260
 there is right in the middle of our flower and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.720
 we will take our scissors and match 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.000
 we have like this to make a circle 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.500
 so that it looks straight and does not 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.020
 they give as well as that disheveled 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.420
 and ready we have our flower now 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.120
 we will take one of these pins that are 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.730
 that are for the earrings that I tell them 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.980
 I used those that of earrings that I have already 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.970
 lost we're going to put silicon and the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.970
 let's hit back 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.010
 since we hit in this way with a lot 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.610
 be careful because remember that you are 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.610
 hot 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.340
 let's take and put more silicone res 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.549
 a re around and over we're going to 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.849
 paste a little circle of the same color 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.159
 our of our flower so that it 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.430
 keep fixed what we're going to put right in 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.830
 means of ball earring piquito of 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.650
 earring so that it looks good and so we are going to 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.280
 to be able to strengthen it and not fall down so 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.459
 fast and ready with this let's finish 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.349
 our earrings remember that you can 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.180
 make different colors or equal 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.840
 different sizes we see each other until the
