00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 well hey love youtuber and remich do 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.870
 yes i am your geniki and i do 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.280
 again a video for months no 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.670
 topic made no for weeks 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 and yes, how can I get him to do that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.660
 looks like I have totally different this time 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.390
 So methods do not have such methods 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.699
 hey never talk to you about jobs 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.300
 and what do I know because then they pull 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.189
 certainly not out of it would be better 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 If he does not have too much friendship with 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 so the animals close to me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.680
 example on new drafted 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 do not remember moment date I have not 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:45.570
 the real one I have the 18 third the 23rd 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 and 8 not exactly yes fakt to 3 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 first of all, he will appeal to you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.840
 So he gets to know that too 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.840
 a requirement do not fear her 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.430
 I'll see that he's leaving 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 Just talk to us once 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.460
 it only appears very briefly and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 then do not let it bother you 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.150
 nothing just a response and then only 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 still ignore then you have to be careful 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.320
 that you are really new people so 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 that will be with you and nine people 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.299
 I have just moved out recently 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 that was shit so I have to first 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.799
 wait until another one moves in again 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.290
 and if he is re-drawn 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.610
 because maybe another week will wait 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 the need him again according 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.210
 would have to address a maximum of two times 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.210
 he ever moves away and yes 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.850
 so now we are back I have the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.400
 group four I also have several times 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.780
 two people were rewound earlier 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.450
 they are not raised 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.190
 should therefore be 1 should also 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.610
 Note that if you have this here 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.710
 For example, I want to get rid of you 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.070
 just play play games 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.580
 eight should just start playing 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.050
 then friends too are forgiven because of that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.200
 it would be better if you contacts 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.600
 So your friends is beating shortly before 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 talk to each other again and again 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.440
 a nice tree wet to big detours 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.780
 this stupid man so now if we 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.070
 want to keep eg image will hopefully 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.770
 they are still there that we are then 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.750
 We need to talk to you several times 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.270
 that's not where I read it just says 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.959
 actually butterflies even if he 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.640
 That does not just make me clear 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.160
 and well the stop with your friends 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.019
 Talk about not taking off and yes 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.840
 that we simply the best ideal 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.790
 possible idea for the possibility cola 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.760
 I just do not agree until first 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.980
 again in a week 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.390
 or just a few days and then 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:59.530
 let's see, and moment will be said 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.090
 beck this yes we have to move away there 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.140
 you say so oh no please do not 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.510
 no , not no 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.760
 I do not want to be like me 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.709
 thought that you care if 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.549
 if that's the case then i'll just stay 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.540
 in the reichstag 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.440
 hey why should I move away is me 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.260
 something noticed 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.410
 you were the one I ripped off 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.410
 to have 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.460
 he runs after that so well then do not care 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.310
 we'll see further 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.710
 oh yes we now have 10 27 04 again 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.790
 So far from the wind I've got that 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.580
 finally found 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.170
 better and now it is getting high 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.270
 time we talk again 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.570
 It would be best if you only him 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.950
 Talking about it with two times 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.930
 and now when these signs come 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.300
 Ignore this sign because that too 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.310
 if you are too curious to say what he says 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.310
 sometimes say I want to move away 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.140
 he says yes then rich away and then 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.570
 he immediately changes his opinion on 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.150
 for example not I stay away 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.530
 dear height 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.750
 then only the possibility helps 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.580
 internal turn on again 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.190
 and then you come back the same but 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:22.800
 do not ignore anymore then you are 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:27.420
 this time advantage and yes you shit 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.220
 now we have to wait for that hope 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.240
 At some point he will look again twice 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.330
 do not appeal in the apartment 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.610
 appeal to hope that their girlfriend 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:45.090
 still remain and see if I am 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:46.980
 really still 2 468 awaits 2 468 9 and 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.390
 just hope that someday 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.129
 pulls away because I also have slow 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.189
 really do not bother him 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.490
 and yes I play the whole month before 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.289
 it is enough for me 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.229
 people will i think i would have 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.210
 not believing now but I have 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.740
 he just plays me 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.630
 babbled because she is too lazy in the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.699
 That's it 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.050
 typical 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.730
 and yes I have to tell you the trick 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.170
 Unfortunately 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.120
 worked out exactly you just have two 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.480
 I'll be twelfth 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.740
 fifth worth more against the best tracks 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.750
 it would be if her after her husband 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.150
 save all your friends again 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.730
 so the best it would be 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.220
 all residents are here too 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.020
 chats and I'm totally happy that 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.160
 he has moved away believes he comes 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.830
 Anyway one more here 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.700
 It would be best if it only attracts 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.250
 even if you immediately mitigate immediately 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.440
 linda yes I believe you melinda is running 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.090
 going and somewhere here maybe 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.680
 already in place with project in doing so 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.420
 nobody can pull anymore 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.190
 I did that here, too 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.430
 unfortunately I have to hurry and that 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.660
 bike pay yes I hope it has 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.550
 I like you, I hope it has you 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.020
 helped 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.090
 Finally, I'll do one again 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.310
 general stuff then I write that 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.080
 just so on with music maybe too 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.880
 maybe not but yes i hope 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.540
 the video has you I am not like 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:14.310
 to the mega happy that this olaf finally 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.540
 way is so I find it really cool 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.660
 and do not be surprised why I do so much 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.610
 weed because I thought so 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.350
 neglect your city marl with it 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.620
 First, I get these medals when I am 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.720
 afterwards everything knows where this helios 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.030
 comes and secondly then I thought so 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.350
 hey if euro instead of if your city 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.780
 so is potthÃ¤sslich no one 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.630
 move in and want as fast as 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.670
 possible to move people away and yes that 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.490
 So my trick was only two times 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:45.340
 address with a tremendous distance 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.840
 because if it appeals to you on the first day 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.060
 and on the second day it will be again 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.890
 I do not think so 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.020
 and then if you give them the second time 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.820
 therefore appeal once only twice 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.070
 appeal and so that's nothing 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.510
 need to click 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.460
 and yes I hope you liked it 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.290
 I hope it helped you and me 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.620
 hope for more with you that the 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:08.070
 annoyed people that you finally 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.070
 Get rid of
