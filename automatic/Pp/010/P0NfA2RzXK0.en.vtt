00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to get a comparison between both models

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.240

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
little bit and other models trying to

little bit and other models trying to
ease<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.470> bit<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.770> Fridays<00:01:29.130> wins

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
ease back a little bit on Fridays wins

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.980 
ease back a little bit on Fridays wins
but<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.850> convinced<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.750> need<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
but I'm not convinced so we need to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.899 
but I'm not convinced so we need to
watch<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.560> too<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.400> into<00:01:32.640> next

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
watch that one too and then into next

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.789 
watch that one too and then into next
week<00:01:33.270> well<00:01:33.570> windy<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.259> well<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
towards the east I can see the reasoning

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.490 
towards the east I can see the reasoning
for<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.660> I've<00:02:39.780> got<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.020> be<00:02:40.080> honest<00:02:40.320> that

course a long way to go and trying to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.390 
course a long way to go and trying to
pin<00:03:24.840> down<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.110> details<00:03:25.290> pretty<00:03:25.769> tricky<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
pin down the details pretty tricky and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.060 
pin down the details pretty tricky and
what<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.299> interesting<00:03:27.900> from<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.200> run<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
what is interesting from this run of the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.130 
what is interesting from this run of the
GFS<00:03:29.580> vote<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.269> they<00:03:30.510> look<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.049> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
GFS vote is that they look this is the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.110 
GFS vote is that they look this is the
ridge<00:03:31.320> out<00:03:31.500> towards<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> East<00:03:32.519> which<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.880> what

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
ridge out towards the East which is what

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.180 
ridge out towards the East which is what
of<00:03:33.239> course<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.720> GM<00:03:34.200> was<00:03:34.410> doing<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> Canadian

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
of course the GM was doing the Canadian

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.370 
of course the GM was doing the Canadian
as<00:03:35.310> well<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.790> we've<00:03:36.600> just<00:03:36.630> got<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.989> watch<00:03:37.110> this

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
as well so we've just got to watch this

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.699 
as well so we've just got to watch this
one<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.820> CFS<00:03:39.330> he's<00:03:39.600> also<00:03:39.810> trying<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.470> hint

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
one and the CFS he's also trying to hint

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.410 
one and the CFS he's also trying to hint
at<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.040> change<00:03:41.430> taking<00:03:41.760> place<00:03:41.910> now<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.330> think

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
at a change taking place now I think

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210 
at a change taking place now I think
it's<00:03:42.690> probably<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.350> stay<00:03:43.440> unsettled

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
it's probably going to stay unsettled

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.500 
it's probably going to stay unsettled
through<00:03:44.610> into<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> beginning<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.420> new

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
through into the beginning of the new

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.750 
through into the beginning of the new
year<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> big<00:03:46.590> temperature<00:03:47.100> decrease<00:03:47.580> look

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
year but a big temperature decrease look

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.690 
year but a big temperature decrease look
showing<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.390> CFS<00:03:48.840> here<00:03:49.110> from<00:03:49.830> around

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
showing on the CFS here from around

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.490 
showing on the CFS here from around
about<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.000> sixth<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.450> January<00:03:51.900> I'm<00:03:52.080> wondering

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
about the sixth of January I'm wondering

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.350 
about the sixth of January I'm wondering
if<00:03:52.560> it's<00:03:52.650> more<00:03:52.920> around<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.280> 10th<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.000> 15

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
if it's more around the 10th to the 15

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.210 
if it's more around the 10th to the 15
that<00:03:54.840> we<00:03:54.959> see<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.170> temperature<00:03:55.590> drop<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.100> this

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
that we see a temperature drop but this

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.610 
that we see a temperature drop but this
would<00:03:56.400> make<00:03:56.580> sense<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.630> we'd<00:03:58.140> see<00:03:58.410> these

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
would make sense that we'd see these

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.199 
would make sense that we'd see these
really<00:03:58.980> strong<00:03:59.040> winds<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.640> for<00:03:59.820> several<00:04:00.180> weeks

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
really strong winds in for several weeks

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.120 
really strong winds in for several weeks
and<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.780> relatively<00:04:01.410> mild<00:04:01.709> temperatures

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
and the relatively mild temperatures

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.830 
and the relatively mild temperatures
here<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:02.880> we<00:04:02.970> see<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.269> drop<00:04:03.660> off

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
here but then we see this drop off

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.630 
here but then we see this drop off
taking<00:04:04.290> place<00:04:04.530> as<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.580> more

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
taking place as I so I think it's more

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.330 
taking place as I so I think it's more
around<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.450> 10th<00:04:06.690> 15th<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:07.620> sort<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.010> period

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
around the 10th 15th that sort of period

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.740 
around the 10th 15th that sort of period
that<00:04:08.459> would<00:04:08.549> see<00:04:08.700> cooler<00:04:09.000> cooling<00:04:09.450> down

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
that would see cooler cooling down

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.630 
that would see cooler cooling down
taking<00:04:10.049> place<00:04:10.350> but<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.040> see<00:04:11.220> here<00:04:11.489> how

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
taking place but you see here how

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.460 
taking place but you see here how
temperatures<00:04:12.060> fall<00:04:12.239> off<00:04:12.420> from<00:04:12.660> maximums<00:04:13.110> of

sort of 12s over the next few days down

winter cold weather but interesting that

to do this and why is it well

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.719 
to do this and why is it well
if<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:28.050> look<00:04:28.199> at<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.530> weekly<00:04:28.979> chance<00:04:29.430> from<00:04:29.610> the

for<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.790> south<00:04:51.470> but<00:04:52.470> then<00:04:52.650> weeks<00:04:52.889> three<00:04:53.669> which

you would call it the second third of

January now CFS is the CFS he just does
jump<00:05:44.639> around<00:05:44.910> all<00:05:45.060> over<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.360> place<00:05:45.419> but<00:05:45.900> at

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
jump around all over the place but at

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.260 
jump around all over the place but at
times<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.919> makes<00:05:47.099> logical<00:05:47.370> decisions<00:05:48.150> and

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
times it makes logical decisions and

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.719 
times it makes logical decisions and
this<00:05:48.479> seems<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.260> be<00:05:49.289> logical<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:50.039> seems<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.700> be

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
this seems to be logical it seems to be

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.490 
this seems to be logical it seems to be
a<00:05:50.849> progression<00:05:51.060> that<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.900> weather<00:05:52.080> could

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
a progression that the weather could

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500 
a progression that the weather could
take<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:53.070> there<00:05:53.220> may<00:05:53.400> be<00:05:53.430> some<00:05:53.729> hints<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.000> some

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
take so there may be some hints of some

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.020 
take so there may be some hints of some
cold<00:05:54.780> weather<00:05:54.960> coming<00:05:55.440> through<00:05:55.919> of<00:05:56.729> course

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
cold weather coming through of course

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.189 
cold weather coming through of course
we'll<00:05:57.180> watch<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.539> over<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.840> coming<00:05:57.960> days

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
we'll watch that over the coming days

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.629 
we'll watch that over the coming days
keep<00:05:58.500> you<00:05:58.590> updated<00:05:58.949> and<00:05:59.190> we'll<00:05:59.340> look<00:05:59.460> for

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
signs of that as well building through

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.529 
signs of that as well building through
the<00:06:01.740> numerical<00:06:02.669> models<00:06:02.970> over<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.360> coming
