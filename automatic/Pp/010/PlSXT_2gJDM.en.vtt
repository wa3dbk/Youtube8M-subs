here she is in all her splendor
it's<00:00:05.220> our<00:00:05.600> solar-powered<00:00:07.340> hydroponic<00:00:08.340> garden

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
it's our solar-powered hydroponic garden

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.690 
it's our solar-powered hydroponic garden
let<00:00:10.230> me<00:00:10.320> walk<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.559> through<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.160> process<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
let me walk you through the process and

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.749 
let me walk you through the process and
show<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.389> how<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.599> works<00:00:13.370> well<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> all

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
show you how it works well first of all

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.630 
show you how it works well first of all
the<00:00:14.910> process<00:00:15.089> starts<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.890> solar<00:00:17.340> cell

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the process starts with this solar cell

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
the process starts with this solar cell
right<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:17.970> when<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> Sun<00:00:19.230> hits<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> cell

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
right here when the Sun hits the cell

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.960 
right here when the Sun hits the cell
well<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> powers<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.949> small<00:00:22.949> water<00:00:23.340> pump<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
well it powers a small water pump that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.230 
well it powers a small water pump that
we<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.859> inside<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.099> plastic<00:00:26.640> bin<00:00:26.789> I'll

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
we have inside this plastic bin I'll

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.480 
we have inside this plastic bin I'll
take<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> out<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.340> going

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
take it out but if I do then it's going

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.139 
take it out but if I do then it's going
to<00:00:29.550> stop<00:00:29.730> pumping<00:00:30.679> we<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.830> clear<00:00:32.309> restraint

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
to stop pumping we will clear restraint

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.830 
to stop pumping we will clear restraint
but<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.590> leave<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.160> part<00:00:35.809> through<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
but then I leave this part through a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.950 
but then I leave this part through a
garden<00:00:37.170> hose<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.590> piece<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> PVC<00:00:38.780> which<00:00:39.780> I've

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
garden hose to a piece of PVC which I've

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
garden hose to a piece of PVC which I've
got<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.730> suspended<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.840> both<00:00:43.410> our<00:00:43.649> our

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
got and suspended on top of both our our
growing<00:00:44.789> tubes<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> couple<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.350> spares

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
growing tubes got a couple of spares

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
growing tubes got a couple of spares
over<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.640> dealing<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.059> those

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
over here I'm going dealing with those

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.779 
over here I'm going dealing with those
in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> next<00:00:48.510> couple<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> days<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.379> now

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
in the next couple of days but for now

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
in the next couple of days but for now
these<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.940> our<00:00:50.969> tubes<00:00:51.329> which<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.960> filled

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
these are our tubes which are filled

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 
these are our tubes which are filled
with<00:00:52.399> Spanish<00:00:53.399> muffs<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:54.960> top

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
with Spanish muffs all the way from top

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.569 
with Spanish muffs all the way from top
to<00:00:55.170> bottom<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.160> we've<00:00:56.399> got<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to bottom and you can see we've got a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.360 
to bottom and you can see we've got a
really<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.239> good<00:00:57.390> stream<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.109> there

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
really really good stream right there

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
really really good stream right there
good<00:00:59.370> stream<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> water<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.620> each<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.340> our

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
good stream of water in each one of our

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.830 
good stream of water in each one of our
tubes<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> we've<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:08.939> plenty<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.600> water

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
tubes so we've got plenty of water

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.620 
tubes so we've got plenty of water
plenty<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.560> oxygen<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> water<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.360> some

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
plenty of oxygen in the water and some

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.230 
plenty of oxygen in the water and some
fertilizer<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.470> also

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
fertilizer in there also

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.740 
fertilizer in there also
and<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.950> each<00:01:16.950> tube<00:01:17.430> has<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:20.280> each<00:01:20.430> hole<00:01:20.750> we

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and so each tube has in each hole we

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
and so each tube has in each hole we
have<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:23.780> well<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.020> we've<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.970> tomato

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
have a well here we've got a a tomato

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.280 
have a well here we've got a a tomato
plant<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.759> other<00:01:30.020> areas<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> even

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
plant but in the other areas and even

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
plant but in the other areas and even
the<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.680> drain<00:01:32.220> pipe<00:01:32.490> over<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> I'm

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the the drain pipe over here that I'm

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.819 
the the drain pipe over here that I'm
losing<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.200> I'll<00:01:34.290> show<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> how<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> works

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
losing and I'll show you how that works

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.800 
losing and I'll show you how that works
in<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.130> moment<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> minute<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.240> each<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
in a moment in a minute so each of the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
in a moment in a minute so each of the
tube<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.799> hole<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.250> inside<00:01:38.850> each<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
tube has a hole and inside each of the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
tube has a hole and inside each of the
holes<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.650> plinth<00:01:41.119> right<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.240> we've

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
holes we have a plinth right now we've

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.920 
holes we have a plinth right now we've
got<00:01:42.600> squash<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.390> we've<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:46.250> peppers<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
got squash in here we've got peppers and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.340 
got squash in here we've got peppers and
tomatoes<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.680> each<00:01:50.040> two<00:01:50.399> drips<00:01:51.200> into<00:01:52.200> our

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
tomatoes and so each two drips into our

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
tomatoes and so each two drips into our
drain<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.700> well

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
drain right there and this one as well

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.959 
drain right there and this one as well
it's<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> slow<00:01:57.810> drip<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.700> is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's a slow drip and then this now is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.380 
it's a slow drip and then this now is
then<00:02:00.509> led<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.020> our<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:02.100> drain<00:02:02.430> pipe<00:02:02.670> okay

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
then led to our other drain pipe okay

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990 
then led to our other drain pipe okay
which<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.960> angle<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.469> put<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> couple<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.759> holes

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
which is angle I put a couple of holes

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.160 
which is angle I put a couple of holes
in<00:02:06.119> there<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.509> sure<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.899> drains

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
in there to make sure that it drains

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.470 
in there to make sure that it drains
properly<00:02:07.640> see<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.080> then<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:11.480> drain

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
properly see this and then in this drain

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.230 
properly see this and then in this drain
over<00:02:12.629> here

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
over here

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.100 
over here
we've<00:02:14.599> got<00:02:14.810> some<00:02:15.530> more<00:02:15.709> squash<00:02:16.099> celery<00:02:17.110> celery

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
we've got some more squash celery celery

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.630 
we've got some more squash celery celery
they're<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.830> couple<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.130> days<00:02:19.280> ago<00:02:19.550> and

they're just a couple of days ago and
it's<00:02:19.730> sprouting<00:02:20.180> already<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.190> this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's sprouting already and then this

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.640 
it's sprouting already and then this
drain<00:02:23.230> completes<00:02:24.230> our<00:02:24.580> circuit<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.650> drips

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
drain completes our circuit and drips

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.449 
drain completes our circuit and drips
right<00:02:27.860> back<00:02:28.069> into<00:02:28.340> our<00:02:28.640> bin<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:31.870> complete

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
right back into our bin to complete

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.880 
right back into our bin to complete
perfect<00:02:34.459> circus<00:02:35.620> self<00:02:36.620> watering<00:02:36.940> garden<00:02:37.940> and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
perfect circus self watering garden and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850 
perfect circus self watering garden and
we<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.100> have<00:02:40.250> sprouted<00:02:40.610> those<00:02:41.000> seeds<00:02:41.860> about

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
we just have sprouted those seeds about

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.729 
we just have sprouted those seeds about
a<00:02:43.010> week<00:02:43.310> ago<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.440> we're<00:02:45.440> really<00:02:45.560> looking

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
a week ago so we're really looking

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.920 
a week ago so we're really looking
forward<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.220> somewhere<00:02:47.650> some<00:02:48.650> growth<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
forward to somewhere some growth and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.150 
forward to somewhere some growth and
vegetable<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:52.330> some<00:02:53.330> fruit<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.980> then<00:02:54.980> we're

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
vegetable and some fruit and then we're

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.720 
vegetable and some fruit and then we're
going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.430> using<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> other<00:02:55.940> tubes<00:02:56.360> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
going to be using the other tubes to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.170 
going to be using the other tubes to
extend<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.819> garden<00:02:59.150> by<00:02:59.830> another<00:03:00.830> 15<00:03:01.670> or<00:03:01.790> 20

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
extend the garden by another 15 or 20

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.690 
extend the garden by another 15 or 20
plants<00:03:03.140> in<00:03:03.260> there<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.620> then<00:03:04.430> we'll<00:03:04.580> keep

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
plants in there and then we'll keep

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.150 
plants in there and then we'll keep
building<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.600> listen<00:03:05.959> um<00:03:06.140> pretty<00:03:06.860> simple

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
building so listen um pretty simple

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.420 
building so listen um pretty simple
process<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.060> use<00:03:08.330> some<00:03:08.480> two<00:03:08.630> by<00:03:08.780> fours<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:10.010> to

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
process so use some two by fours to to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.330 
process so use some two by fours to to
build<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.760> base<00:03:11.140> but<00:03:12.140> ultimately<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:13.220> all

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
build the base but ultimately it all

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.000 
build the base but ultimately it all
starts<00:03:13.700> with<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.600> really<00:03:15.290> really<00:03:15.680> neat<00:03:15.860> little
