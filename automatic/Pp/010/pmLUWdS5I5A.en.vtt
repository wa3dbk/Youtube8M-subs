00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
you haven't watched the first three then

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.430

guess<00:06:51.610> and<00:06:52.610> also<00:06:52.850> Rio<00:06:53.470> which<00:06:54.470> is<00:06:54.620> about<00:06:54.890> a<00:06:54.950> an

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
guess and also Rio which is about a an

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.150 
guess and also Rio which is about a an
animation<00:06:56.270> talking<00:06:57.260> parrot<00:06:57.500> or<00:06:57.620> whatever<00:06:57.920> i

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
animation talking parrot or whatever i

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.040 
animation talking parrot or whatever i
guess<00:06:58.520> it<00:06:58.670> was<00:06:58.700> made<00:06:58.910> feeling<00:06:59.150> people<00:06:59.270> that

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
guess it was made feeling people that

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.960 
guess it was made feeling people that
made<00:07:00.320> ice<00:07:00.500> age<00:07:00.770> so<00:07:00.980> if<00:07:01.070> you<00:07:01.160> have<00:07:01.250> kids<00:07:01.550> i<00:07:01.820> guess

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
made ice age so if you have kids i guess

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.880 
made ice age so if you have kids i guess
it's<00:07:02.150> good<00:07:02.330> for<00:07:02.510> them<00:07:04.480> but<00:07:05.480> the<00:07:06.170> movie<00:07:06.590> i<00:07:06.620> will
