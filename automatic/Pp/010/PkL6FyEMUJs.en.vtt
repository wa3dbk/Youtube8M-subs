either use a silicone brush because that
won't<00:01:44.140> melt<00:01:44.380> or<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.460> can<00:01:45.670> put<00:01:46.330> some<00:01:46.360> olive<00:01:46.810> oil

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
towel over this so you're going to place

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.430 
towel over this so you're going to place
the<00:01:53.860> chicken<00:01:53.890> on<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.580> grill<00:01:55.170> breast<00:01:56.170> side

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the chicken on the grill breast side

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.370 
the chicken on the grill breast side
down<00:01:56.740> first<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:58.720> you're<00:01:59.020> going<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.170> let<00:01:59.350> it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
down first and you're going to let it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.109 
down first and you're going to let it
cook<00:01:59.680> there<00:01:59.979> for<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:02.740> 15<00:02:03.039> minutes

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 

and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.869> you're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> turn<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and then you're going to turn the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.919 
and then you're going to turn the
chicken<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> whole<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
chicken and the whole thing is going to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
chicken and the whole thing is going to
take<00:02:10.080> about<00:02:10.259> an<00:02:10.379> hour<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.800> cook<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.700> three

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
take about an hour to cook for a three

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.759 
take about an hour to cook for a three
to<00:02:12.030> four-pound<00:02:12.300> chicken<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.560> you're<00:02:13.650> going

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
to four-pound chicken and you're going

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.970 
to four-pound chicken and you're going
to<00:02:13.830> want<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> flip<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.250> every<00:02:14.849> 15<00:02:15.480> minutes<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
to want to flip it every 15 minutes the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.400 
to want to flip it every 15 minutes the
internal<00:02:17.580> temperature<00:02:17.700> should<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.180> about<00:02:18.410> 165

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
internal temperature should be about 165

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.229 
internal temperature should be about 165
degrees<00:02:19.800> or<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.550> also<00:02:20.670> if<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:20.940> cut<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
degrees or you can also if you cut the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.400 
degrees or you can also if you cut the
thickest<00:02:21.540> part<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.810> chicken<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.230> juice

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
thickest part of the chicken the juice

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.229 
thickest part of the chicken the juice
should<00:02:22.590> should<00:02:22.950> run<00:02:23.160> clear<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.120> I'm

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
should should run clear in it so I'm

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.780 
should should run clear in it so I'm
going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.450> let<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.780> sit<00:02:25.049> for<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.349> bit

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
going to let that sit for a little bit

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:38.449 
going to let that sit for a little bit
and<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.120> we'll<00:02:27.720> come<00:02:27.930> back<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.230> it

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.339 

okay<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:40.329> checked<00:02:40.689> the<00:02:40.750> temperature<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
okay so I checked the temperature of the

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.410 
okay so I checked the temperature of the
chicken<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.709> little<00:02:41.950> while<00:02:42.069> ago<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.430> was<00:02:42.549> at<00:02:42.640> 165

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
chicken a little while ago it was at 165

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.119 
chicken a little while ago it was at 165
this<00:02:44.200> chicken<00:02:44.470> actually<00:02:44.590> had<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.950> cook<00:02:45.099> for

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
this chicken actually had to cook for

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.410 
this chicken actually had to cook for
about<00:02:45.430> an<00:02:45.549> hour<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.819> 10<00:02:45.970> minutes<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.299> it's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
about an hour and 10 minutes so it's

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.610 
about an hour and 10 minutes so it's
good<00:02:46.599> that<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.840> check<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.409> if<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.530> have

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
good that you check to see if you have

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.080 
good that you check to see if you have
to<00:02:47.709> leave<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.099> at<00:02:48.280> all<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.879> when<00:02:49.000> you're

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
to leave it on at all and when you're

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.819 
to leave it on at all and when you're
using<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.420> meat<00:02:49.599> thermometer<00:02:49.750> make<00:02:50.319> sure<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
using a meat thermometer make sure the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.410 
using a meat thermometer make sure the
end<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.670> thermometer<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.060> not<00:02:52.150> hitting

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
end of the thermometer is not hitting

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.699 
end of the thermometer is not hitting
the<00:02:52.510> bone<00:02:52.689> because<00:02:53.019> that's<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.379> affect

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
the bone because that's going to affect

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.000 
the bone because that's going to affect
the<00:02:54.220> reading<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.939> it<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:55.659> now<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.859> the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the reading of it so now that the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.920 
the reading of it so now that the
chicken<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.430> done<00:02:57.459> I'm<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.030> going<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.599> set<00:02:58.840> it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
chicken is done I'm just going to set it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.300 
chicken is done I'm just going to set it
on<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.200> platter<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.799> I'm<00:02:59.950> going<00:03:00.099> to<00:03:00.159> let<00:03:00.280> it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
on this platter and I'm going to let it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.460 
on this platter and I'm going to let it
rest<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.760> little<00:03:00.879> so<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.629> absorb<00:03:01.810> some

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
rest a little so that it can absorb some

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.809 
rest a little so that it can absorb some
of<00:03:02.500> its<00:03:02.739> natural<00:03:03.579> juices<00:03:03.970> before<00:03:04.859> we<00:03:05.859> cut<00:03:06.640> into

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
of its natural juices before we cut into

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.690 
of its natural juices before we cut into
it<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:09.430> grille<00:03:09.730> off<00:03:11.010> okay<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.159> while<00:03:12.400> that's

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
it this grille off okay and while that's

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.509 
it this grille off okay and while that's
resting<00:03:12.940> I'm<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.379> make<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.799> very<00:03:15.250> simple

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
resting I'm going to make a very simple

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.640 
resting I'm going to make a very simple
coleslaw<00:03:16.480> now<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> lot<00:03:17.139> of<00:03:17.200> people<00:03:17.379> think<00:03:17.560> they

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
coleslaw now a lot of people think they

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.809 
coleslaw now a lot of people think they
don't<00:03:17.739> like<00:03:17.859> coleslaw<00:03:18.129> but<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:18.609> really<00:03:18.730> just

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
don't like coleslaw but it's really just

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.539 
don't like coleslaw but it's really just
the<00:03:19.060> dressing<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.629> they<00:03:19.780> don't<00:03:19.959> like

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
the dressing that they don't like

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.160 
the dressing that they don't like
cabbage<00:03:21.549> itself<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.599> know<00:03:22.720> doesn't<00:03:23.049> have<00:03:23.109> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
cabbage itself you know doesn't have a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.599 
cabbage itself you know doesn't have a
lot<00:03:23.379> of<00:03:23.409> flavor<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:23.859> way<00:03:23.980> or<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.220> other<00:03:24.250> so

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
lot of flavor one way or the other so

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.979 
lot of flavor one way or the other so
it's<00:03:24.730> really<00:03:24.849> kind<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> what<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.480> add<00:03:25.659> to<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
it's really kind of what you add to it

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
it's really kind of what you add to it
and<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.439> is<00:03:26.560> such<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.829> cheap<00:03:27.250> meal<00:03:27.549> because

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and it is such a cheap meal because

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.289 
and it is such a cheap meal because
cabbage<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:28.659> inexpensive<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:31.269> to

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
cabbage is so inexpensive so I like to

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.960 
cabbage is so inexpensive so I like to
actually<00:03:31.599> take<00:03:32.260> my<00:03:32.739> cabbage<00:03:33.159> and<00:03:33.340> slice<00:03:33.700> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
actually take my cabbage and slice it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.610 
actually take my cabbage and slice it
like<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.510> gives<00:03:34.689> me<00:03:34.870> bigger<00:03:35.109> chunks<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
like this it gives me bigger chunks and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.979 
like this it gives me bigger chunks and
it's<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:35.950> much<00:03:36.129> quicker<00:03:36.370> than<00:03:36.519> grading<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.299> so

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
it's so much quicker than grading it so

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.990 
it's so much quicker than grading it so

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
but you can just use all of one color if

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.619 
but you can just use all of one color if

ahead of time so that the flavors

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.069
