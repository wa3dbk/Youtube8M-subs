the RPF just here to do another video
showing<00:00:10.830> off<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.670> progress<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.960> on

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
showing off the progress that I have on

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.540 
showing off the progress that I have on
the<00:00:14.309> boot<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> Iron<00:00:15.990> Man<00:00:16.230> suit<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the boot for the Iron Man suit and to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.080 
the boot for the Iron Man suit and to
give<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> little<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.840> how-to<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.910> way

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
give a little bit of a how-to on the way

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.099 
give a little bit of a how-to on the way
that<00:00:21.330> I've<00:00:21.480> done<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.740> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
that I've done it just kind of a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.080 
that I've done it just kind of a
unorthodox<00:00:25.109> way<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> end<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
unorthodox way but I think in the end it

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.040 
unorthodox way but I think in the end it
will<00:00:27.269> pay<00:00:27.900> off<00:00:27.930> quite<00:00:28.320> well<00:00:29.150> this<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
will pay off quite well this is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
will pay off quite well this is
partially<00:00:31.859> using<00:00:32.360> Stefano's<00:00:33.360> design<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.550> his

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
partially using Stefano's design of his

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000 
partially using Stefano's design of his
foam<00:00:35.880> templates<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.989> order<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.770> toe

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
foam templates in order to do the toe

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
foam templates in order to do the toe
section<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.670> well<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> back<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
section as well as the back here which I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.069 
section as well as the back here which I
still<00:00:40.170> need<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> complete<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> idea<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
still need to complete the idea of this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.940 
still need to complete the idea of this
basically<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:45.420> give<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.920> more

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
basically is to give a bit more

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.360 
basically is to give a bit more
stability<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.969> foot<00:00:48.329> by<00:00:49.110> having<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
stability for a foot by having the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.450 
stability for a foot by having the
interior<00:00:50.910> section<00:00:51.360> done<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.199> order<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.710> slip

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
interior section done in order to slip

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
interior section done in order to slip
in<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.350> shoes<00:00:55.640> like<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.510> by

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
in a shoes like this and I think that by

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.050 
in a shoes like this and I think that by
doing<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:01.829> give<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:03.320> more<00:01:04.320> stable

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
doing this it will give a more stable

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.200 
doing this it will give a more stable
comfortable<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> fit<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.369> will

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
comfortable sort of fit to it that will

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700 
comfortable sort of fit to it that will
give<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> nice<00:01:09.689> look<00:01:10.140> once<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.590> all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
give it a nice look once it's all

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.730 
give it a nice look once it's all
completed<00:01:11.750> basically<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> idea<00:01:13.229> behind<00:01:13.380> this

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
completed basically the idea behind this

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.109 
completed basically the idea behind this
is<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.880> modify<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:16.439> files<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.640> peppercorn

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is to modify the files the peppercorn

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.050 
is to modify the files the peppercorn
files<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.630> order<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> include<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:20.460> foot

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
files in order to include this foot

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
files in order to include this foot
section<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> completed

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
section here that it's the completed

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.719 
section here that it's the completed
main<00:01:23.400> foot<00:01:23.640> section<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:25.159> not<00:01:26.159> too<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.520> more

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
main foot section it's not too much more

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.620 
main foot section it's not too much more
to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:28.799> gives<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> good<00:01:29.250> stable<00:01:29.939> base<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to do and it gives a good stable base to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.760 
to do and it gives a good stable base to
work<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:32.030> then<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:34.439> simply

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
work off of then from there it's simply

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.819 
work off of then from there it's simply
just<00:01:34.829> adding<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:36.299> pieces<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.590> well

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
just adding on these pieces here as well

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
just adding on these pieces here as well
as<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> back<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.240> underneath<00:01:39.570> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
as the back and then underneath just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
as the back and then underneath just
kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.650> filling<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.430> foam<00:01:41.850> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
kind of filling it in with a foam in

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.319 
kind of filling it in with a foam in
order<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.110> give<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.880> some<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:44.909> stability

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
order to give it some more stability

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.990 
order to give it some more stability
rather<00:01:45.659> than<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.170> having<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.579> big

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
rather than just having this like a big

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.990 
rather than just having this like a big
gaping<00:01:48.869> area<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.920> kind<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.430> collapse<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
gaping area that kind of collapse and I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120 
gaping area that kind of collapse and I
need<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> when<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> walk<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> same<00:01:52.950> idea

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
need to when you walk so the same idea

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280 
need to when you walk so the same idea
will<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.610> added<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> back<00:01:54.630> here<00:01:54.930> once<00:01:55.170> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
will be added on to the back here once I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.670 
will be added on to the back here once I
have<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> section<00:01:56.159> done<00:01:56.899> it's<00:01:57.899> looking<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
have that section done it's looking a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.679 
have that section done it's looking a
little<00:01:58.799> rough<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.640> moment<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.240> extra

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
little rough at the moment with extra

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.819 
little rough at the moment with extra
glue<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.229> pretty<00:02:01.380> sure<00:02:01.590> we'll<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.799> able

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
glue but I'm pretty sure we'll be able

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
glue but I'm pretty sure we'll be able
to<00:02:02.040> clean<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.280> off<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.939> painting<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to clean that off and painting and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.539 
to clean that off and painting and
sealing<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.259> definitely<00:02:04.829> cover<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.399> lot

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
sealing will definitely cover up a lot

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.679 
sealing will definitely cover up a lot
of<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
of the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.930 
of the
the<00:02:07.200> lines<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.099> mistakes<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> I've

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the lines and little mistakes that I've

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.510 
the lines and little mistakes that I've
made<00:02:09.170> but<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.349> think<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> first<00:02:11.190> attempt

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
made but I think for a first attempt

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
made but I think for a first attempt
working<00:02:11.880> with<00:02:12.030> foam<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.959> come<00:02:13.650> out

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
