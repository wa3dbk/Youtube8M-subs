hey<00:00:00.420> guys<00:00:00.659> Michael<00:00:01.199> from<00:00:01.290> copper<00:00:01.469> vs<00:00:01.860> glass

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey guys Michael from copper vs glass

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys Michael from copper vs glass
and<00:00:02.700> let's<00:00:02.879> compare<00:00:03.149> two<00:00:03.419> cases<00:00:03.929> for<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.350> g3

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
and let's compare two cases for the g3

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.270 
and let's compare two cases for the g3
this<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.879> spigen<00:00:06.420> ultra<00:00:06.569> fit<00:00:07.140> versus<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
this is the spigen ultra fit versus the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.240 
this is the spigen ultra fit versus the
rinky<00:00:08.700> slim

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.049 

starting<00:00:15.250> off<00:00:15.280> with<00:00:15.430> the<00:00:15.550> design<00:00:15.850> of<00:00:15.880> the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
starting off with the design of the

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.340 
starting off with the design of the
cases<00:00:16.480> we're<00:00:16.720> going<00:00:16.840> to<00:00:16.900> start<00:00:17.140> with<00:00:17.230> the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
cases we're going to start with the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.740 
cases we're going to start with the
rinky<00:00:17.860> slim<00:00:18.189> now<00:00:18.880> I've<00:00:18.939> got<00:00:19.090> several<00:00:19.360> videos

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
rinky slim now I've got several videos

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.690 
rinky slim now I've got several videos
which<00:00:19.990> will<00:00:20.230> link<00:00:20.439> down<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.710> description<00:00:20.890> for

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
which will link down the description for

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.640 
which will link down the description for
a<00:00:21.730> reviews<00:00:22.060> for<00:00:22.240> both<00:00:22.420> these<00:00:22.599> cases<00:00:22.810> so<00:00:23.529> be

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
a reviews for both these cases so be

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.589 
a reviews for both these cases so be
sure<00:00:23.680> to<00:00:23.830> check<00:00:23.950> those<00:00:24.250> out<00:00:24.490> now<00:00:25.180> in<00:00:25.270> terms<00:00:25.450> of

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
sure to check those out now in terms of

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.910 
sure to check those out now in terms of
the<00:00:25.720> rink<00:00:25.960> you<00:00:26.080> seem<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.410> can<00:00:26.529> see<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:26.830> it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
the rink you seem you can see that it's

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.380 
the rink you seem you can see that it's
slightly<00:00:27.160> different<00:00:27.640> in<00:00:27.669> terms<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.150> snap

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
slightly different in terms of the snap

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.570 
slightly different in terms of the snap
on<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.600> back<00:00:28.750> style<00:00:29.050> case<00:00:29.350> as<00:00:29.920> it<00:00:30.130> covers<00:00:30.310> both

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
on the back style case as it covers both

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.519 
on the back style case as it covers both
the<00:00:30.789> top<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.420> bottom<00:00:31.750> of<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.290> phone

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
the top and the bottom of the phone

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.740 
the top and the bottom of the phone
which<00:00:33.040> is<00:00:33.220> slightly<00:00:33.430> unusual<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.390> does<00:00:34.570> give

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
which is slightly unusual and does give

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.420 
which is slightly unusual and does give
a<00:00:34.780> unique<00:00:34.989> look<00:00:35.290> to<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.590> actual<00:00:35.680> case<00:00:36.040> itself

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
a unique look to the actual case itself

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.640 
a unique look to the actual case itself
because<00:00:37.059> it<00:00:37.180> does<00:00:37.360> still<00:00:37.570> keep<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.900> thin<00:00:38.260> form

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
because it does still keep the thin form

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.619 
because it does still keep the thin form
factor<00:00:39.129> but<00:00:39.580> it<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:39.820> also<00:00:39.970> quite<00:00:40.239> protective

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
factor but it is also quite protective

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.150 
factor but it is also quite protective
if<00:00:40.870> you<00:00:40.989> want<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.230> drop<00:00:41.379> on<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.620> top<00:00:41.860> and<00:00:42.010> the

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
if you want to drop on the top and the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.240 
if you want to drop on the top and the
bottom<00:00:42.309> which<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.180> speaking<00:00:43.600> currently<00:00:44.019> say

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
bottom which the speaking currently say

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.950 
bottom which the speaking currently say
also<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.400> ports<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:45.760> cutouts<00:00:46.180> are<00:00:46.360> perfect

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
also the ports and cutouts are perfect

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.600 
also the ports and cutouts are perfect
and<00:00:47.199> just<00:00:47.739> in<00:00:47.830> general<00:00:47.890> where<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.370> case<00:00:48.580> is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
and just in general where the case is

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.180 
and just in general where the case is
built<00:00:48.970> is<00:00:49.210> very<00:00:49.510> high<00:00:49.690> quality<00:00:49.989> has<00:00:50.860> made<00:00:51.040> of<00:00:51.129> a

built is very high quality has made of a
nice<00:00:51.400> soft<00:00:51.940> touch<00:00:52.089> material<00:00:52.780> moving<00:00:53.500> on<00:00:53.710> to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
nice soft touch material moving on to

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.770 
nice soft touch material moving on to
the<00:00:53.860> ultra<00:00:54.309> fit<00:00:54.549> from<00:00:54.760> spigen<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:55.540> pretty

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the ultra fit from spigen it's pretty

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.750 
the ultra fit from spigen it's pretty
much<00:00:55.930> made<00:00:56.170> of<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.320> same<00:00:56.650> type<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.040> soft<00:00:57.489> touch

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
much made of the same type of soft touch

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.969 
much made of the same type of soft touch
plastic<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.809> definitely<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.350> fan<00:00:59.650> although

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
plastic and definitely a fan although

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.189 
plastic and definitely a fan although
both<00:01:00.309> cases<00:01:00.640> do<00:01:01.059> show<00:01:01.299> fingerprints<00:01:01.869> quite

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
both cases do show fingerprints quite

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.560 
both cases do show fingerprints quite
badly<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.400> speaking<00:01:03.760> ultrafit<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.299> more<00:01:04.479> of

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
badly of a speaking ultrafit is more of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.330 
badly of a speaking ultrafit is more of
a<00:01:04.629> classic<00:01:04.869> snap<00:01:05.440> on<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.650> back<00:01:05.799> style<00:01:06.070> case

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
a classic snap on the back style case

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.550 
a classic snap on the back style case
where<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.000> just<00:01:07.180> snaps<00:01:07.479> on<00:01:07.750> on<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.110> top<00:01:08.350> and

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
where it just snaps on on the top and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.890 
where it just snaps on on the top and
also<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.010> bottom<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.460> fully<00:01:09.729> exposed<00:01:10.240> now

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
also the bottom are fully exposed now

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.450 
also the bottom are fully exposed now
this<00:01:11.020> may<00:01:11.229> be<00:01:11.290> better<00:01:11.590> because<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.040> easier

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
this may be better because of easier

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.370 
this may be better because of easier
access<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:13.000> things<00:01:13.210> are<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.450> IR<00:01:13.780> ports<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
access of things are the IR ports and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.050 
access of things are the IR ports and
also<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.680> headphone<00:01:15.040> jack<00:01:15.070> but<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.909> does

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
also the headphone jack but it does

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060 
also the headphone jack but it does
offer<00:01:16.240> less<00:01:16.540> protection<00:01:16.960> one<00:01:17.770> thing<00:01:17.950> that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
offer less protection one thing that

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.530 
offer less protection one thing that
would<00:01:18.280> say<00:01:18.490> though<00:01:18.670> although<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.150> spigen

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
would say though although the spigen

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.930 
would say though although the spigen
ultra<00:01:19.660> fit<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.140> sort<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.440> thin<00:01:20.710> case<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.910> a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
ultra fit is sort of thin case it is a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.880 
ultra fit is sort of thin case it is a
slight<00:01:22.540> bit<00:01:22.780> thicker<00:01:23.110> than<00:01:23.620> what<00:01:23.770> you're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
slight bit thicker than what you're

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.830 
slight bit thicker than what you're
going<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.070> get<00:01:24.190> with<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.520> rinky<00:01:24.940> sim<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.720> it's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
going to get with the rinky sim so it's

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.360 
going to get with the rinky sim so it's
definitely<00:01:26.140> something<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.560> keep<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:26.860> mind<00:01:26.920> if

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
definitely something to keep in mind if

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.070 
definitely something to keep in mind if
you<00:01:27.490> are<00:01:27.640> looking<00:01:27.730> for<00:01:27.910> a<00:01:28.120> super<00:01:28.570> stem<00:01:28.810> case

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
you are looking for a super stem case

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.220 
you are looking for a super stem case
full<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.740> g3<00:01:30.420> inserting<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.510> phone<00:01:31.720> into<00:01:32.140> the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
full of g3 inserting the phone into the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.930 
full of g3 inserting the phone into the
actual<00:01:32.470> case<00:01:32.650> itself<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:33.280> very<00:01:33.490> simple

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
actual case itself is very simple

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.700 
actual case itself is very simple
although<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.690> do<00:01:34.810> have<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.140> make<00:01:35.290> sure<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.620> is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
although you do have to make sure it is

that fast focus and the LED flash now in
terms<00:01:51.880> of<00:01:52.060> protection<00:01:52.600> like<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> set<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.170> does

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
terms of protection like a set it does

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.200 
terms of protection like a set it does
offer<00:01:53.590> more<00:01:53.920> protection<00:01:53.950> than<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.730> spigen

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
offer more protection than the spigen

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.149 
offer more protection than the spigen
we're<00:01:55.630> both<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.930> top<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.170> bottom<00:01:56.380> covered

we're both the top and bottom covered

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.860 
we're both the top and bottom covered
now<00:01:57.610> one<00:01:57.790> thing<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.120> would<00:01:58.270> say<00:01:58.330> both

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
now one thing that I would say both

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560 
now one thing that I would say both
these<00:01:59.110> cases<00:01:59.350> do<00:01:59.710> have<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> top<00:02:00.310> exposed<00:02:00.909> ever

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
these cases do have the top exposed ever

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.380 
these cases do have the top exposed ever
so<00:02:01.870> slowly<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.620> right-hand<00:02:03.190> side<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:03.940> for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
so slowly on the right-hand side as for

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.700 
so slowly on the right-hand side as for
the<00:02:04.450> Korean<00:02:04.840> models<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.260> does<00:02:05.440> have<00:02:05.620> an

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
the Korean models it does have an

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.649 
the Korean models it does have an
antenna<00:02:06.010> that<00:02:06.159> comes<00:02:06.490> out<00:02:06.729> how's<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.420> save

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
antenna that comes out how's it a save

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.240 
antenna that comes out how's it a save
on<00:02:07.690> money<00:02:07.990> they've<00:02:08.409> just<00:02:08.590> basically<00:02:08.920> done<00:02:09.129> the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
on money they've just basically done the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.430 
on money they've just basically done the
same<00:02:09.429> case<00:02:09.729> all<00:02:09.970> over<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> world<00:02:10.629> be<00:02:11.379> in

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
same case all over the world be in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.259 
same case all over the world be in
general<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:12.129> case<00:02:12.400> definitely<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:13.030> very

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
general this case definitely is very

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.330 
general this case definitely is very
nice<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.989> feels<00:02:14.019> nice<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:15.190> does

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
nice it feels nice and it does

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.130 
nice it feels nice and it does
definitely<00:02:15.519> keep<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.030> form<00:02:16.450> factor<00:02:16.659> of<00:02:16.959> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
definitely keep the form factor of the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.830 
definitely keep the form factor of the
g3<00:02:17.709> with<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> being<00:02:18.489> safe<00:02:18.790> thin<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.330> also<00:02:19.720> it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
g3 with it being safe thin and also it's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.330 
g3 with it being safe thin and also it's
quite<00:02:20.049> light<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.800> it's<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:20.950> going<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.250> add

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
quite light so it's not going to add

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.460 
quite light so it's not going to add
much<00:02:21.550> bulk<00:02:21.880> or<00:02:22.060> anything<00:02:22.330> onto<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.750> phone<00:02:23.020> so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
much bulk or anything onto the phone so

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.000 
much bulk or anything onto the phone so
don't<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.040> worry<00:02:24.069> about<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
don't really have to worry about that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.000 
don't really have to worry about that
now<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.730> spigen<00:02:26.569> ultra<00:02:26.689> fit<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.530> again

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
now on to the spigen ultra fit and again

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.039 
now on to the spigen ultra fit and again
I<00:02:28.040> put<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> phone<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.269> actual<00:02:29.420> case<00:02:29.810> is

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
I put the phone on to the actual case is

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.990 
I put the phone on to the actual case is
very<00:02:30.349> simple<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.069> need<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.459> snap<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.849> in

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
very simple you just need to snap it in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.179 
very simple you just need to snap it in
now<00:02:32.569> one<00:02:32.720> thing<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.019> would<00:02:33.230> say<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.860> ultra

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
now one thing I would say is the ultra

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.220 
now one thing I would say is the ultra
fit<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.519> spigen<00:02:35.030> does<00:02:35.510> actually<00:02:35.720> feel<00:02:36.019> a<00:02:36.049> bit

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
fit from spigen does actually feel a bit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.660 
fit from spigen does actually feel a bit
more<00:02:36.409> secure<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:36.860> there's<00:02:37.159> a<00:02:37.220> tighter<00:02:37.489> fit

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
more secure and there's a tighter fit

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.979 
more secure and there's a tighter fit
than<00:02:38.090> what<00:02:38.209> you're<00:02:38.329> gonna<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.689> with<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
than what you're gonna get with the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.289 
than what you're gonna get with the
rinky<00:02:39.319> slim<00:02:39.620> now<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.549> mentioned<00:02:40.579> before<00:02:40.970> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
rinky slim now as I mentioned before the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.479 
rinky slim now as I mentioned before the
case<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.720> slightly<00:02:42.140> thicker<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.129> turns<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
case is slightly thicker so it turns the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.399 
case is slightly thicker so it turns the
dimple<00:02:43.909> on<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> back<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.629> access<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.170> power

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
dimple on the back to access the power

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.350 
dimple on the back to access the power
on<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.069> also<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.430> volume<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.940> down<00:02:46.970> is

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
on and also the volume up and down is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.089 
on and also the volume up and down is
solid<00:02:48.110> deeper<00:02:48.470> than<00:02:48.560> what<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.769> are<00:02:48.799> going<00:02:49.010> to

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
solid deeper than what you are going to

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.190 
solid deeper than what you are going to
get<00:02:49.220> on<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> rinky<00:02:49.730> slim<00:02:50.000> obviously<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.989> bomb

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
get on the rinky slim obviously the bomb

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.470 
get on the rinky slim obviously the bomb
and<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.590> top<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:51.980> case<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.430> fully<00:02:52.909> exposed

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
and the top of the case is fully exposed

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.990 
and the top of the case is fully exposed
so<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.079> do<00:02:54.200> get<00:02:54.349> easy<00:02:54.530> access<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:55.220> things<00:02:55.430> but

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
so you do get easy access to things but

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.580 
so you do get easy access to things but
one<00:02:56.120> thing<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.329> I<00:02:56.480> would<00:02:56.629> say<00:02:56.689> is<00:02:57.109> dropping

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
one thing that I would say is dropping

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.199 
one thing that I would say is dropping
the<00:02:57.709> case<00:02:57.859> on<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.220> floor<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.909> are<00:02:59.030> going<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the case on the floor you are going to

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.430 
the case on the floor you are going to
have<00:02:59.299> some<00:02:59.450> issues<00:02:59.629> if<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.079> going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> land

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
have some issues if it's going to land
