00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
little crappy so she just asked me if we

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.570 
little crappy so she just asked me if we
wanted<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.380> blocking<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.010> side<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.459> not

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
wanted to do blocking on the side or not

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.850 
wanted to do blocking on the side or not
basically<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.060> she<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.330> get<00:02:45.450> away<00:02:45.569> with<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
basically if she can get away with it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.940 
basically if she can get away with it
we<00:02:47.580> don't<00:02:47.790> usually<00:02:48.600> want<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.990> span<00:02:49.260> over<00:02:49.410> 24

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
we don't usually want to span over 24

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.979 
we don't usually want to span over 24
inches<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.700> don't<00:02:50.910> want<00:02:51.060> any<00:02:51.209> given<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.750> wood

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
inches we don't want any given that wood

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.680 
inches we don't want any given that wood
that<00:02:52.020> way<00:02:52.350> when<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.739> zap<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.550> when<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.360> fill<00:02:54.569> it

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that way when we zap it when we fill it

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.690 
that way when we zap it when we fill it
or<00:02:54.780> anything<00:02:55.200> it'll<00:02:55.500> crack<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.550> why<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
or anything it'll crack so that's why I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.130 
or anything it'll crack so that's why I
would<00:02:56.940> rather<00:02:57.060> put<00:02:57.300> blocking<00:02:57.750> there<00:02:57.900> take

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
would rather put blocking there take

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.900 
would rather put blocking there take
that<00:02:58.290> extra<00:02:58.560> step<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.100> way<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.610> looks<00:02:59.760> good

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
that extra step that way it looks good

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:09.330 
that extra step that way it looks good
