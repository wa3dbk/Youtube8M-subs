 and show how the turning mechanism works 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.199
 so we have a phone 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.189

 then on the upper side we have a button 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.949
 on off phones 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.069
 on the bottom of the speaker 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.579
 on this side we have a connector for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.300
 charging connections 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.200
 and connector for 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.440
 headphones and also for connecting not 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 hurried 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.320
 means on this country there is nothing except 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 two megapixel cameras without focus and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.560
 flash means on the back side 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.220

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.140
 and also cameras 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.610
 means how to get to the battery 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.440
 to remove the cover you need to click you here 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 and at the same time 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.940
 are you here 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.490
 plastic cover 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 and if you need more careful 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 then think of the communicator 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.680
 hooks 2 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.380
 how this time was such a procession 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 at 3 7 golf 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.330
 means to insert a sim card we shift 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.710
 opening up 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.190
 insert circus card 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.900
 close and fix all the cards are nowhere 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.300

 and a growth place icon 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 I insert it there 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.029
 or close the lid 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.149
 as for the pivot 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.380
 mechanism it works in four positions 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.440
 means the first position is 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.930
 Naturally the phone is now in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.550
 In this position, the second position is the camera. 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.629
 the third position is musical 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:24.939
 turntable 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.379
 and the fourth position is also a camera 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.779
 just like that 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.909
 but I think on this for now all the following reviews 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.599
 we will look in detail 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.929
 every position 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.689
 all see all tell 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.189
 but all the while everyone is watching next 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:46.639
