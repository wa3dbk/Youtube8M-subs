00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 That's why two very special ones want to come 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 broadcast by the lenz today at 14 o'clock 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.059
 and I thought many of you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 we still have a town hall laughing and I 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.720
 I would like to give you two base designs today 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.970
 Imagine me personally very well 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.199
 I have chosen and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.800
 I would like to go with the first one 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.660
 to begin 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.750
 I do not know anybody 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.060
 from the other clan begins to sound 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 with drain is now also in the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.960
 situation that he maybe one 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 good form in the base needs if ever 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.230
 his punishment therefore accepts matthias 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.270
 please still you have your base too 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.530
 Leave three days that was the punishment and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.809
 Do not rebuild after ten hours 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 So please, I 'm usually yes 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.840
 not so strict for tight 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.280
 please write everyone under the video 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 matthias penalty must be that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 For a long time we speak 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 of course want to look 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 in this base I just now 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.090
 you have built so you see I still have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 a few things left of course because of me 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.979
 yes, I'm already half past eight and therefore few 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.689
 More items over 25 times a very good one 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.909
 Indiz that I wall all 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.350
 used for city hall 8 okay so 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.890
 why did I like these best ones 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.590
 I'm so gantzer only one thing clear 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 castle is very center of the barbarian king 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 is the middle and the dark lex here 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.060
 what we always need is actually 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 also very centrally then just adds 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.090
 that this is the dark, so to speak 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 here in the reason of these two magath 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.430
 is also still protected and this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 magic atom also protects the two 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.790
 camp here with this magic atom is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.259
 even the chip is still good 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.149
 elixier wednesdays also purely put 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.079
 you can do what you want us to do 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.280
 Of course we can 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.210
 flexible at babbels we can do it 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 of course also swap 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 By now, for example, that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.700
 create and then put the ball in 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.009
 if you maybe the primary protected 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 want to have or so are whole again 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.939
 flexible and that's good for me too 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.310
 like the base we still have room 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.469
 for elixir collectors and goldmines companies 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.630
 if this mappus or something or if you are 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.310
 is an offer or if so primary 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 save on 1 then she could still 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.960
 to adjust 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 men b 14 places one two three four 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.790
 five places are free again where we have that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.260
 can still adjust I think is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.910
 actually quite good we still have one 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.890
 some nice ones are included here 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.920
 giant bombs we see here now 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.410
 also a hidden one and yes me 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.610
 find the simple base really cool must 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 so if any of you still say so 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 a good try I am yes I am 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 I became aware of this picture 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.930
 she really really cool and can 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.220
 I only recommend to everyone the alignment 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.680
 I also think the fair is very good and 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.550
 which of course is still very cool 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.530
 do you hear that look at the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.290
 Mine throwers are beautiful in a triangle 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.350
 built up the air defense covers so far 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.450
 Everything we can from our searchers 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.970
 Air mines and our normal air 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.740
 built wonderfully wonderful 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.920
 place 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.540
 everything is running and yes I think that is 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.270
 already on a cool base I have to say 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.260
 he would have liked it better than me 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.220
 Maybe I would have been 8 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.230
 spared a lot of trouble 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.940
 but I would not be happy if you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.770
 sometimes feedback the load together 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.320
 if this is for you or maybe 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.910
 not and yes otherwise I would say 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.460
 I'm going to change my mind quickly 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.070
 I want a second base 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.780
 would like to introduce you and we would 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.670
 look at us then also one 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.810
 ask base and maybe if i have the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.190
 day then of course a 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.170
 trafik still imagine if you can 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.430
 So you want to sign if you have the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.050
 wanted to see a professional better one 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.090
 cool then you write in the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.440
 comments and then us too 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.810
 So remember to build at the same time 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.560
 just for good day and welcome back 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.820
 then always think that if the new 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.900
 recordings no that is still the 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.650
 old recordings and still hessen 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.030
 to look at it and the second base 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.790
 which are still built so that is 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.830
 Now that's how we specialize 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.240
 to get out of here the magician atom and take 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.680
 for my dear the marked number 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.420
 7 even if he does not of course now 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 all 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.090
 a little better than advisory eight out ok 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.360
 So I think this base is right 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.370
 horny because they also beautiful the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.870
 suit the tenant has and next nice 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.870
 The ball also announced relatively much 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.280
 covers and the dark here too 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.700
 you have to be protected sometimes 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.590
 say what and when still almost monastic 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.049
 same as the old world so what 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.700
 is still cool at base you have outside in 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.050
 the ring still some mines and collectors 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.210
 protected, I think also quite cold so 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.710
 driving ultra hardcore 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.000
 can one say what mistake in it one has 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.020
 I do not really like that here 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.310
 I do not really like that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.440
 the theme we solve here is the theme 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.160
 We solve the bomb so here towards building 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.250
 the other bomb bomb can ok there 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.630
 the even closer 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.660
 We let her do what with 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.460
 still cool at the base yet for 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.110
 I like the arrangement of teslas 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.870
 also quite good we have three tesla 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.069
 here it available 1 2 and 3, the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.560
 Daily still in the middle I find 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.050
 very good and of course the showpiece 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.120
 this base that we choose as atoms 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.830
 have spread very well and that really 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.440
 cover a lot so you have to 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.690
 say the camps are very very good 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.479
 The air defense is well protected 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.919
 triangle means she almost covers almost 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.090
 Everything from here we can one more 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.240
 help out a bit by adding one more 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.889
 have air bomb on this page 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.150
 which is good, of course 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.180
 Positioning of the bow towers here 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.039
 nice on the outside around then 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.110
 as much as possible outside here 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.070
 to cover the possibility of troops 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.530
 can come in 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.930
 what else to mention is of course 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.449
 our mine throwers are relatively centered 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.039
 but are still dead 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.199
 area of ​​this mine launcher not 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.659
 outside the walls and because of that 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.740
 he , too, had protected me almost everything 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.789
 is of it so I have to say 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.250
 I really like this world too 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.870
 very good and you can say yes 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.250
 which base of this is a new one 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.199
 i will definitely be the favorite one 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.889
 interest 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.409
 and then you are already in this 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.389
 small episode I do not know exactly what 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.289
 come off 17:00 I will'm there 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.690
 you can still think 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.469
 Let's surprise and I would say 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.169
 thank you watch on the case for 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.430
 and if you still have a cool cup base 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.719
 may want to see the next few days 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.949
 then you can write me that yourself 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.120
 then if we look at it 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.440
 go in and then if again look 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.729
 that we also find something there and 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.289
 maybe a hybrid base or something 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.690
 or maybe freight seven times 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.099
 what you can do then directly 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.780
 sign here what you want to see 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.639
 and then I would say 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.860
 At the end , thanks for watching, thumbs up 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.270
 did not subscribe to top 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.050
 forget and so on and so on 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.050
 next time
