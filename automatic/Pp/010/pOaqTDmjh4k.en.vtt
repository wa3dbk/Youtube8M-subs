 dedicated to the new collection runs 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.360
 today I will try to recreate an outfit and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.040
 explained this collection from dai 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.169

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.119
 an ideal collection for those who want 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.430
 dare with color in any 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.470
 situation without giving up 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.970
 be fine and elegant 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.670
 let's see immediately what I chose for 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.890
 this look first I chose one 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 white shirt with pink defoe that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 just the one you see yourself wearing them 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.579
 now and then just a blazer shirt over 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 of fuchsia cotton therefore a beautiful color 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 bright and bright for this shade 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.929
 I let myself be inspired by color 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.859
 of the enamel and lipstick of this one 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.199
 new collection 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.179
 as this jacket has a line 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.909
 quite straight wanted to emphasize 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.309
 a little more life with this 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 belt that I developed above the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.670
 shirt good but not matched little 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 irritating I say them bronze and why 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.940
 chose this color 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 first of all because it reminds us a little of the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.030
 color of the bronzer of this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.520
 new collection 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 and then because we have recently entered into 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.930
 this new season in the season 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.270
 spring and therefore we owe a little 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.060
 usual we want the garments 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.130
 colorful we want to abandon 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 dark clothes in the closet we have 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 used practically all winter 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 but this thing I had to do 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 in small steps the floor plan and then 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.240
 because of this god I chose this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.810
 bronze color because it is not a color 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.939
 too dark is absolutely not 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.610
 brilliant however on the whole I see 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:02:00.229
 the of it or in any case the idea of ​​unique 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:02.420
 colored we conclude now talking about the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.539
 accessories and I kicked these 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.539
 fuxa sandals so as to make her a guest 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.269
 little pro feminine and fine I chose this one 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.030
 micro rubber bag with gods 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.250
 fuchsia gold details that you have 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.050
 in short, in the same shade as 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.239
 give in many mistakes touch of color 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.760

 accessories and of course make-up 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.319

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.660
 create a decidedly colorful look 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.360
 but at the same time with start player 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.069
