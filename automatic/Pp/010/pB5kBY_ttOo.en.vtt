00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.920
 Good people, I'll give you a tip here. 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.889
 How do you cut the easiest way? 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.610
 and rapid abusive use of you in these 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.139
 roles 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.510
 brace for you to apply in your career 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.850
 You printed it on your laser person. 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.070
 in case here as if half fast could 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.690
 to have used this space here would fit 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.410
 more pens 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.150
 but here is just a tip from the cut what 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.430
 you will need a ruler 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.800
 Preferably the metal stylet one 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.350
 glass base or near- cut is 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.930
 so whats the catch you take 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 rule and you will not cut the first 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 part here you will start on the second 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.930
 so you leave here free what here 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.870
 you do not agree 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.079
 in the second and will make a cut out 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 the outside 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 You're in sequence until the end. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.320
 the accused with the hand to cut himself 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:36.570
 There are some rules even they have 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:40.229
 protection in case of first cut is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.280
 so you do not boot on that first nor the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.979
 the last one that will normally 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.410
 same thing on the diagonal you do not 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.380
 cut the first one or you're loose 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.380
 the pieces then you start on the second 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:12.390
 do not move otherwise great will be very 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:17.550
 Nice demonstration that happens already 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.739
 begins to fall on these ideas when you 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.580
 finish diagonally 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:28.340
 all these loose parts after the last 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.340
 side cut step
