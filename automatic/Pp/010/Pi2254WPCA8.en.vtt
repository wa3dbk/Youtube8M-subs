00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.270 

well<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.840> think<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.110> series<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.590> never<00:00:10.889> really

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
well I think the series you never really

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.390 
well I think the series you never really
went<00:00:11.910> our<00:00:12.150> way<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.540> know<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.620> most<00:00:14.309> of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
went our way you know if you see most of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.039 
went our way you know if you see most of
the<00:00:14.549> sessions<00:00:14.910> woven<00:00:15.299> by<00:00:15.480> them<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:15.960> if

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the sessions woven by them you know if

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.779 
the sessions woven by them you know if
you<00:00:16.199> break<00:00:16.619> five<00:00:16.920> days<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> cricket<00:00:17.550> into

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
you break five days of cricket into

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.179 
you break five days of cricket into
small<00:00:18.029> sessions<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.630> know<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.289> think<00:00:19.710> more

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
small sessions you know I think more

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.790 
small sessions you know I think more
often<00:00:20.369> than<00:00:20.670> not<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.970> were<00:00:21.119> outplayed<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:22.529> both

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
often than not we were outplayed in both

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.349 
often than not we were outplayed in both
the<00:00:22.949> bowling<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> batting<00:00:23.820> department

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the bowling and the batting department

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.870 
the bowling and the batting department
so<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> standard<00:00:26.340> example<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so I think it's a standard example as I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.070 
so I think it's a standard example as I
said<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.539> were<00:00:27.630> completely

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
said you know we were completely

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.390 
said you know we were completely
outplayed<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> whole<00:00:29.310> series<00:00:29.609> over

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
outplayed in in the whole series over

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.060 
outplayed in in the whole series over

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.229 

well<00:00:38.070> again<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.550> difficult<00:00:38.879> one

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
well again that's a very difficult one

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.450 
well again that's a very difficult one
you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.930> can't<00:00:40.379> exactly<00:00:40.770> pinpoint<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you know I can't exactly pinpoint the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
you know I can't exactly pinpoint the
reason<00:00:41.730> okay<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.450> went<00:00:43.079> wrong

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
reason okay this is what went wrong

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319 
reason okay this is what went wrong
because<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.489> easy<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.149> know

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
because if it was so easy then you know

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
because if it was so easy then you know
you<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.600> rectified<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.289> problem<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
you would have rectified the problem so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
you would have rectified the problem so
I<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.989> pressure<00:00:49.200> kept

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I think you know the pressure kept

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100 
I think you know the pressure kept
mounting<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.100> us<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:50.910> once<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.570> start

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
mounting on us you know once you start

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920 
mounting on us you know once you start
up<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.039> series<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.780> you're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
up the series and if you do if you're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.389 
up the series and if you do if you're
not<00:00:55.079> able<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> opposition<00:00:56.010> out

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
not able to get the opposition out

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
not able to get the opposition out
because<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.719> bowler<00:00:57.989> less<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
because you have one bowler less and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
because you have one bowler less and
then<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.309> keeps<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.730> mounting<00:01:00.149> as

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
then you know it keeps on mounting as

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.360 
then you know it keeps on mounting as
the<00:01:00.420> series<00:01:00.690> progresses<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> forget

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the series progresses and not to forget

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.039 
the series progresses and not to forget
England<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.510> side<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
England they are a very good side and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
England they are a very good side and
and<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.040> throughout<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> series<00:01:05.729> they

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and you know throughout the series they

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
and you know throughout the series they
have<00:01:06.090> done<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.860> think<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
have done really well so I think that's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.850 
have done really well so I think that's
that<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> reason<00:01:15.470> well<00:01:16.470> again<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that that's the reason well again you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.219 
that that's the reason well again you
know<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.939> major<00:01:18.360> question<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.960> whether<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
know the major question is whether it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
know the major question is whether it
will<00:01:19.409> help<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.520> needs<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.420> done

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
will help you know what needs to be done

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.999 
will help you know what needs to be done
is<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.960> whether<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.259> lose<00:01:22.500> by<00:01:22.710> four

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
is you know whether you lose by four

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
is you know whether you lose by four
wickets<00:01:23.220> four<00:01:23.610> runs<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.299> 400<00:01:24.810> runs

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
wickets four runs or you know 400 runs

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
wickets four runs or you know 400 runs
what's<00:01:25.200> important<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> think

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
what's important is you know to think

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.429 
what's important is you know to think
about<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> right<00:01:27.570> things<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
about the right things you know that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.980 
about the right things you know that
will<00:01:28.590> help<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.939> back<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> reminder

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
will help you get back in the reminder

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
will help you get back in the reminder
of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> series<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.820> Test

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
of the series so I think with one Test

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
of the series so I think with one Test
match<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:34.020> what's<00:01:34.590> important

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
match to go you know what's important

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
match to go you know what's important
for<00:01:35.220> us<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.329> about<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> margin

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
for us is not to think about the margin

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
for us is not to think about the margin
you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.259> rather<00:01:37.439> than<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.729> we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you know rather than think about what we

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
you know rather than think about what we
should<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> improve<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> kind

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
should do you know to improve the kind

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
should do you know to improve the kind
of<00:01:40.710> cricket<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.220> playing

two years or one-and-a-half year of
consistent<00:02:15.100> cricket<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.820> played

consistent cricket that you have played

consistent cricket that you have played
so<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.840> spot<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.320> know<00:02:17.440> where<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.250> others

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
so it's a spot you know where the others

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.490 
so it's a spot you know where the others
will<00:02:18.700> try<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.270> improve<00:02:19.750> themselves<00:02:19.990> as<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> team

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
will try to improve themselves as a team

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.210 
will try to improve themselves as a team
and<00:02:20.830> try<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.300> dethrone<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.570> one<00:02:22.900> who's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and try to dethrone the one who's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.290 
and try to dethrone the one who's
already<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> number<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.820> slot<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.270> I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
already at the number one slot so I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.050 
already at the number one slot so I
think<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.690> constant<00:02:26.140> process<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
think it's a constant process and you

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.310 
think it's a constant process and you
know<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> won't<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.690> comment<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
know I won't like to comment on the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.230 
know I won't like to comment on the
other<00:02:29.500> side<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.790> they<00:02:30.940> are<00:02:31.060> going

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
