 proved to be very successful 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.950
 Castellanos instead of Sebastien 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.779
 we are in it with his 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.690
 Colleague Julie Kidman in a scary 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 dream worlds your experiences 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.170
 overlap with those of

 of course, that's how she meets her 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 well-known protagonists will be josef 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.520

 for the main game who does not yet 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.250
 should have by diamond so 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 if possible, leave your fingers 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.830
 as regards the gameplay 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 the deal looks clear from the 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.920
 main campaign instead of using a pistol 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.720
 draws the heroes with only one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.220

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 to deliver shootings with monsters 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.580
 I have no choice but to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 no matter if it's about 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.799
 standard enemies or huge bosses opponents 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.799
 act 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.180
 the classic action is limited 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.770
 on the scripts the sequences or one 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.360
 scripted sequence for one 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.800
 firearm gets the protagonist 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 only once in hand 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.040
 depressed 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.600
 also in the main game plentiful 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.670
 existing stealth kill weapons after 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.040
 are once over use 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 very rare sown the nice 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.000
 so unfair fall adventures 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.470

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.229
 take care of her murderous again 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 To escape things are the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.300
 protagonist several possibilities 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.979
 open 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.979

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.780
 They thrown bottles in the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.780

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.780
 your existances fall by means of environment 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.159

 or trick the nymphs and they 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.129
 However, they often lock away 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.450
 There is nothing left but easy 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.099
 to take the tracks in the hand 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.079

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.440
 but not always so easy 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.299

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.109
 but still not on the contrary the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.349
 You often get game over screen 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.349
 see 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.430

 opponents variety in ebay will find them 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.219
