also<00:02:37.220> credit<00:02:37.850> look<00:02:38.420> at<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:39.380> awful<00:02:39.800> look

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
also credit look at this is awful look

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.500 
also credit look at this is awful look
we<00:02:40.100> haven't<00:02:40.400> done<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.670> control<00:02:40.850> panel<00:02:41.360> yet

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
we haven't done the control panel yet

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.640 
we haven't done the control panel yet
this<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.380> how<00:02:42.530> they<00:02:42.740> look<00:02:42.920> when<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:47.650> Steven

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
this is how they look when it is Steven

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.530 
this is how they look when it is Steven
has<00:02:49.070> done<00:02:49.340> some<00:02:49.610> beautiful<00:02:49.790> work<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.420> the
