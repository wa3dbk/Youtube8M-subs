 megaman is blue thanks to the first 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.519
 appearance was in nes I had a 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.620
 limited selection of colors 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.690
 recently navigating the dark 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.819
 Internet forums I came across a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.739
 game that I totally did not know but that 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.049
 read your story I'm interested in 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.299
 barbarity although more than own 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.849
 game what really interested me the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.940
 black legend around him knows this 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.530
 voice the video game that worked miracles 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.230
 this is almost as disturbing as the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.780
 subliminal messages let's talk about 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.450
 it tavo is one of the most games 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.370
 strangers that I have run into came out 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.250
 for nes 20 years ago and the company 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.230
 in charge of doing it was rare the game 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.049
 I was just trying to do tarot with 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.670
 the player as soon as we start we will have 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.010
 to write our name and our 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.500
 date of birth in addition to telling you if 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.750
 we are man or woman after this we must 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.329
 ask the game a question whatever 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.980
 through a virtual keyboard and this one 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.780
 will deal with shuffling the cards and 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.040
 show us answers to what we have 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.140
 asked 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.359
 to begin with we are facing a game in the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.129
 that we play because we simply 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.760
 we limit ourselves to asking questions to the 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.189
 machine starts to smell weird really worth 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.989
 I know that today something goes up that 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.260
 it would not be much less weird but 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.879
 remember that we are in the month time 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.500
 one times charge a little between their 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.170
 entrails we see that everything has a 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.389
 the most dismal environment music 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.000
 symbology used everything gives a bit of 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.009
 respect also the game does not cut a 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.389
 hair in telling you that you are going to die or in 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.570
 predict situations of the most 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.520
 Pessimists you can search online 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.150
 more information about this game so weird and 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.770
 tÃ©tric capcom is the abbreviation of 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.720
 capsules with reuters kingdom arts 385 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.880
 days and a half uses the same engine 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.270
 graphic that kingdom hearts re coded for 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.270
 La s 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.130
 you knew that the show is not the song of 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.430
 the quads upside down or what he touches 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.430
 cooling 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.660
 what I am going to say to you I do not know if it will be a 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.670
 curiosity but I see it as a 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.920
 coincidence that I do not know who of capcom 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.440
 said the zombies of resident evil 4 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.290
 and 5 would not be with zombies but with 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.120
 infected and in 2006 they will take out dead rising 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.830
 which is a series of zombies with which 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.930
 they fight with what you find even though it is 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.330
 most known for its second installment in 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.430
 2009 but the funny thing is that there 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.620
 appeared after they stopped 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.750
 to be used would have 'resident evil' owners 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.650
 only that I wanted to share record 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.650
