all right so we're gonna cover the

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.310 
all right so we're gonna cover the
differences<00:00:12.040> between<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.910> kel-tec<00:00:13.450> pf9<00:00:13.990> and

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
differences between the kel-tec pf9 and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.060 
differences between the kel-tec pf9 and
the<00:00:15.190> car<00:00:15.429> cm9<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:17.560> thing<00:00:17.740> i'm<00:00:17.830> going<00:00:17.920> to<00:00:17.980> do

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
the car cm9 first thing i'm going to do

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.290 
the car cm9 first thing i'm going to do
is<00:00:18.430> safety<00:00:19.180> check<00:00:19.450> both<00:00:19.690> pistols<00:00:21.120> all<00:00:22.120> right

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
is safety check both pistols all right

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600 
is safety check both pistols all right
there<00:00:22.530> all<00:00:23.530> right<00:00:23.650> now<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:23.860> major<00:00:24.100> difference

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
there all right now the major difference

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.760 
there all right now the major difference
that<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:24.880> found<00:00:25.240> is<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.750> kel-tec<00:00:26.200> which<00:00:26.560> is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
that I found is the kel-tec which is

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.720 
that I found is the kel-tec which is
very<00:00:27.760> similar<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.840> Ruger

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
very similar to the Ruger

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.030 
very similar to the Ruger
nine-millimeter<00:00:30.730> version<00:00:31.120> the<00:00:31.390> Ruger<00:00:31.750> lc9<00:00:32.259> is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
nine-millimeter version the Ruger lc9 is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.090 
nine-millimeter version the Ruger lc9 is
that<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.790> trigger<00:00:34.090> pulls<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.660> them<00:00:34.900> are<00:00:35.140> very

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
that the trigger pulls on them are very

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.190 
that the trigger pulls on them are very
hard<00:00:36.280> it's<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.820> full<00:00:37.060> trigger<00:00:37.360> pull<00:00:37.630> very<00:00:38.020> much

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
hard it's a full trigger pull very much

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.640 
hard it's a full trigger pull very much
like<00:00:38.440> a<00:00:38.470> double<00:00:38.890> action<00:00:39.370> revolver<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.870> then

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
like a double action revolver and then

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.110 
like a double action revolver and then
it<00:00:41.770> breaks<00:00:41.920> at<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.250> end<00:00:42.520> because<00:00:42.820> it's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
it breaks at the end because it's

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.460 
it breaks at the end because it's
actually<00:00:43.390> got<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.540> hammer<00:00:43.810> it's<00:00:44.020> pulling<00:00:44.320> back

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
actually got a hammer it's pulling back

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.310 
actually got a hammer it's pulling back
just<00:00:44.770> like<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.950> double<00:00:45.280> action<00:00:45.550> revolver<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
just like a double action revolver so

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.830 
just like a double action revolver so
the<00:00:47.470> trigger<00:00:47.650> pull<00:00:47.920> on<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:49.390> very<00:00:49.570> difficult

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
the trigger pull on it is very difficult

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.510 
the trigger pull on it is very difficult
now<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:52.450> car<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:53.860> other<00:00:54.100> hand<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.489> a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
now the car on the other hand is a

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.670 
now the car on the other hand is a
striker-fired<00:00:54.880> pistol<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:56.230> means<00:00:56.470> it's<00:00:56.650> a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
striker-fired pistol which means it's a

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.290 
striker-fired pistol which means it's a
lot<00:00:56.860> more<00:00:57.010> like<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.220> Glock<00:00:57.520> so<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.090> trigger

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
lot more like a Glock so the trigger

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.080 
lot more like a Glock so the trigger
pull<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:59.230> there<00:00:59.739> but<00:01:00.399> until<00:01:00.730> you<00:01:00.820> get<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
pull is there but until you get to the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.250 
pull is there but until you get to the
end<00:01:01.300> then<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.810> breaks

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
end then it breaks

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.380 
end then it breaks
so<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.040> overall<00:01:03.310> trigger<00:01:03.640> pull<00:01:03.910> on<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.150> car

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
so the overall trigger pull on the car

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.250 
so the overall trigger pull on the car
is<00:01:04.690> much<00:01:04.900> smoother<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.530> easier<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:08.020> like<00:01:08.229> a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
is much smoother and easier more like a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.760 
is much smoother and easier more like a
Glock<00:01:08.620> trigger<00:01:09.100> pull<00:01:09.370> than<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.540> double<00:01:11.500> action

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
Glock trigger pull than a double action

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.550 
Glock trigger pull than a double action
revolver<00:01:11.860> trigger<00:01:12.520> pull<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:14.350> trigger

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
revolver trigger pull so the trigger

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.840 
revolver trigger pull so the trigger
pulls<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.920> number<00:01:15.130> one<00:01:15.250> thing<00:01:15.460> that's<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
pulls the number one thing that's the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.310 
pulls the number one thing that's the
main<00:01:16.030> difference<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.570> notice<00:01:16.870> on<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.140> guns

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
main difference I notice on the guns

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.550 
main difference I notice on the guns
right<00:01:17.710> off<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.979> bat<00:01:18.420> car<00:01:19.420> is<00:01:19.780> about<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.290> hundred

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
right off the bat car is about a hundred

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.100 
right off the bat car is about a hundred
dollars<00:01:20.620> more<00:01:20.799> expensive<00:01:21.090> than<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.510> kel-tec

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
dollars more expensive than the kel-tec

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.320 
dollars more expensive than the kel-tec
but<00:01:23.409> they're<00:01:23.770> very<00:01:24.070> dependable<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.820> very

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
but they're very dependable and very

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.230 
but they're very dependable and very
nice<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.840> for<00:01:26.409> size<00:01:26.620> comparison<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:28.120> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
nice and for size comparison I have the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.260 
nice and for size comparison I have the
sneaky<00:01:28.659> pete<00:01:28.930> holster<00:01:29.729> designed<00:01:30.729> for<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.000> car

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
sneaky pete holster designed for the car

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.700 
sneaky pete holster designed for the car
as<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.920> can<00:01:33.070> see<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:34.690> car<00:01:34.900> fits<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.470> quite

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
as you can see the car fits in it quite

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:44.690 
as you can see the car fits in it quite
nicely<00:01:36.479> well

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.249 

so<00:01:45.600> does<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.900> PF<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.250> both<00:01:47.640> guns<00:01:48.420> fit<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so does the PF not so both guns fit in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.399 
so does the PF not so both guns fit in
the<00:01:49.409> exact<00:01:49.710> same<00:01:49.950> sneaky<00:01:50.700> pete<00:01:51.170> holster<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the exact same sneaky pete holster and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.370 
the exact same sneaky pete holster and
they<00:01:52.500> both<00:01:52.650> fit<00:01:52.890> snugly<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.210> they're<00:01:54.479> both<00:01:54.630> for

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
they both fit snugly so they're both for

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
they both fit snugly so they're both for
all<00:01:55.439> intents<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.100> purposes<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> same

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
all intents and purposes in the same

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.929 
all intents and purposes in the same
size<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.100> besides<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> trigger<00:01:59.490> pulled<00:01:59.729> being

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
size so besides the trigger pulled being

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.310 
size so besides the trigger pulled being
smoother<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> car<00:02:00.750> they're<00:02:01.020> both<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
smoother on the car they're both the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.029 
smoother on the car they're both the
same<00:02:01.350> size<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.610> get<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.649> larger<00:02:04.649> magazine

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
same size you can get a larger magazine

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.200 
same size you can get a larger magazine
for<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.250> car<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:05.700> hold<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.909> seven

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for the car that will hold the seven

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.029 
for the car that will hold the seven
rounds<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.690> like<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> kel-tec<00:02:07.350> standard

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
rounds just like the kel-tec standard

magazine comes with a six round let's
look<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> shooting<00:02:11.630> okay<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
look at the shooting okay this is the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.290 
look at the shooting okay this is the
kel-tec<00:02:14.670> i<00:02:14.940> hit<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.720> target<00:02:16.170> 13<00:02:16.739> times<00:02:17.300> with

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
kel-tec i hit the target 13 times with

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
kel-tec i hit the target 13 times with
the<00:02:18.420> kel-tec<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.980> very<00:02:20.340> hard<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.670> shoot

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
the kel-tec it is very hard to shoot

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.170 
the kel-tec it is very hard to shoot
that<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.450> learn<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> shoot<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.970> just

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that and learn to shoot it and it's just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.820 
that and learn to shoot it and it's just
not<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.600> accurate<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.350> pistol<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.769> I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
not that accurate of a pistol that I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.449 
not that accurate of a pistol that I
found<00:02:26.450> now<00:02:29.360> here<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.810> car<00:02:31.049> shot<00:02:32.040> group<00:02:32.340> in

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
found now here is the car shot group in

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.190 
found now here is the car shot group in
comparison<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:34.470> lot<00:02:34.950> better<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.870> got<00:02:36.870> I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
comparison it's a lot better I got I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.320 
comparison it's a lot better I got I
missed<00:02:37.739> two<00:02:37.950> off<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.340> target<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.970> other<00:02:39.150> than

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
missed two off the target but other than

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.009 
missed two off the target but other than
that<00:02:39.390> instead<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.380> 13<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> got<00:02:41.269> 18<00:02:42.269> hits<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
that instead of 13 I got 18 hits on the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.500 
that instead of 13 I got 18 hits on the
target<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.470> counted<00:02:44.000> some<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> holes<00:02:45.299> went

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
target I counted some of the holes went

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.910 
target I counted some of the holes went
through<00:02:45.660> other<00:02:45.810> holes<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.380> they<00:02:46.500> doubled<00:02:46.830> up

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
through other holes so they doubled up

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.460 
through other holes so they doubled up
but<00:02:47.610> again<00:02:47.970> much<00:02:48.269> closer<00:02:48.660> much<00:02:49.109> tighter

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
but again much closer much tighter

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.890 
but again much closer much tighter
grouping<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:51.030> car<00:02:51.299> than<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.230> kel-tec<00:02:52.640> now

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
grouping on the car than the kel-tec now

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.750 
grouping on the car than the kel-tec now
just<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.019> comparison<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.829> our<00:02:56.070> shot<00:02:56.280> Kimber

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
just in comparison is our shot Kimber

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.300 
just in comparison is our shot Kimber
and<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.690> Kimber<00:02:57.959> has<00:02:58.109> a<00:02:58.140> much<00:02:58.500> much<00:02:58.769> nicer

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and the Kimber has a much much nicer

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.990 
and the Kimber has a much much nicer
shot<00:03:00.120> grouping<00:03:01.280> than<00:03:02.280> either<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.760> them

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
shot grouping than either one of them

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.729 
shot grouping than either one of them
but<00:03:03.180> again<00:03:03.420> you're<00:03:03.780> talking<00:03:03.930> about<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.320> pistol

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
but again you're talking about a pistol

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.430 
but again you're talking about a pistol
that<00:03:04.890> cost<00:03:05.220> two<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> half<00:03:06.420> times<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.200> three

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
that cost two and a half times to three

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.069 
that cost two and a half times to three
times<00:03:07.769> as<00:03:08.040> much<00:03:08.190> as<00:03:08.459> these<00:03:08.730> pistols<00:03:09.180> did<00:03:09.540> so

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
times as much as these pistols did so

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.690 
times as much as these pistols did so
you<00:03:10.140> would<00:03:10.350> expect<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.890> perform<00:03:11.040> better<00:03:11.459> in

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you would expect it to perform better in

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.680 
you would expect it to perform better in
the<00:03:11.850> accuracy<00:03:12.359> category<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.620> again<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:15.570> know

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the accuracy category so again you know

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.440 
the accuracy category so again you know
the<00:03:16.019> expensive<00:03:16.680> pistol<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the expensive pistol it one out the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.449 
the expensive pistol it one out the
heavier<00:03:18.750> more<00:03:18.989> expensive<00:03:19.440> pistols<00:03:19.799> but<00:03:20.250> again

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
heavier more expensive pistols but again

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.539 
heavier more expensive pistols but again
the<00:03:20.760> car<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> trigger<00:03:22.500> pole<00:03:22.769> not

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
the car because of the trigger pole not

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.890 
the car because of the trigger pole not
because<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.000> seismic<00:03:24.239> because<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
because of the seismic because of the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.539 
because of the seismic because of the
trigger<00:03:25.109> fall<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.620> seems<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.280> far<00:03:26.519> more

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
trigger fall it seems to be far more

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.449 
trigger fall it seems to be far more
accurate<00:03:27.030> when<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.180> shoot<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.290> again<00:03:28.560> your

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
accurate when I shoot it so again your

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.340 
accurate when I shoot it so again your
mileage<00:03:29.640> may<00:03:29.910> differ<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:31.140> you're<00:03:31.260> gonna

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
mileage may differ but if you're gonna

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.640 
mileage may differ but if you're gonna
go<00:03:31.560> for<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.859> small<00:03:32.310> compact<00:03:32.940> carry<00:03:33.390> gun<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.930> would

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
go for a small compact carry gun I would

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.069 
go for a small compact carry gun I would
suggest<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.340> look<00:03:35.670> at<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> car<00:03:36.299> over

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
suggest that you look at the car over

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.400 
suggest that you look at the car over
the<00:03:37.709> kel-tec<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.519> also<00:03:39.060> over<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:40.109> other

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
the kel-tec and also over the other

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.520 
the kel-tec and also over the other
there's<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.510> Diamondback<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.170> same<00:03:43.319> type

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
there's a Diamondback so the same type

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.129 
there's a Diamondback so the same type
of<00:03:43.560> trigger<00:03:43.859> pull<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.850> Ruger<00:03:45.269> lc9<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
of trigger pull the Ruger lc9 is the

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.900 
of trigger pull the Ruger lc9 is the
same<00:03:46.319> type<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.530> trigger<00:03:46.769> pole<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.250> would

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
same type of trigger pole I would

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.370 
same type of trigger pole I would
suggest<00:03:48.060> trying<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.600> find<00:03:48.780> something<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.200> is

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
suggest trying to find something that is

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590 
suggest trying to find something that is
like<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:50.190> car<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> smoother<00:03:51.180> trip<00:03:51.420> will

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
like the car with the smoother trip will

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.950 
like the car with the smoother trip will
go

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
go

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.130 
go
gunshot<00:03:53.390> hold<00:03:54.390> them<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.540> your<00:03:54.630> hand<00:03:54.810> squeeze

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
gunshot hold them in your hand squeeze

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.320 
gunshot hold them in your hand squeeze
them<00:03:55.320> again<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.460> a<00:03:56.490> very<00:03:56.730> small<00:03:56.970> gun<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
them again with a very small gun the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.500 
them again with a very small gun the
trigger<00:03:57.360> pool<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.170> much<00:03:58.440> more<00:03:58.470> important

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
trigger pool is that much more important

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.080 
trigger pool is that much more important
than<00:04:00.510> than<00:04:01.080> anything<00:04:01.320> else<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.100> again<00:04:02.790> hope

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
than than anything else so again hope

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:15.230 
than than anything else so again hope
this<00:04:03.270> helps<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.990> have<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.470> good<00:04:04.620> one<00:04:12.230> Amy
