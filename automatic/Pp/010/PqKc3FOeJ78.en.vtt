00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
three minutes at each aid station you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.369 
three minutes at each aid station you

lose almost an hour of time in terms of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
lose almost an hour of time in terms of
your<00:00:40.530> completion<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.340> adding<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
your completion time you're adding that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.549 
your completion time you're adding that
much<00:00:41.790> time<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
much time in there so you really have to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.600 
much time in there so you really have to
be<00:00:43.739> careful<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> aid<00:00:44.910> stations<00:00:45.390> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
interesting once I discovered it about

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.640 
interesting once I discovered it about
20<00:01:38.410> years<00:01:38.710> ago<00:01:38.860> was<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.960> not<00:01:41.290> all<00:01:41.620> about

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
20 years ago was that it's not all about

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.860 
20 years ago was that it's not all about
the<00:01:42.190> running<00:01:42.670> it's<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:43.060> about<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.600> miles

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
the running it's not about the miles

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.430 
the running it's not about the miles
it's<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.860> more<00:01:45.370> than<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:46.060> it's<00:01:46.440> it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
it's it's more than that and it's it's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.530 
it's it's more than that and it's it's
part<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.130> being<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.550> group<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:49.000> enjoys<00:01:49.330> doing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
part of being a group that enjoys doing

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.620

aid stations especially towards the back
of<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.380> because<00:02:26.980> that's<00:02:27.160> where<00:02:27.370> its<00:02:27.489> most

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
of it because that's where its most

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.960 
of it because that's where its most
interest<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.350> somebody<00:02:30.040> gets<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.820> little

carried away at the age stations they

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.789 
carried away at the age stations they
sit<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.220> chair<00:02:33.989> they<00:02:34.989> really<00:02:35.260> want<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> take

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
sit in a chair they really want to take

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
some rest but it really shouldn't

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
some rest but it really shouldn't
because<00:02:37.930> they're<00:02:38.080> close<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.440> be<00:02:38.530> cut<00:02:38.739> off<00:02:38.860> and

themselves so close to the cut-offs that
