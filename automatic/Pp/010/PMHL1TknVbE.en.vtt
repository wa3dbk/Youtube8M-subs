00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:47.719
 Accented is the night, the crickets are heard in the dark. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 They go out to the ring, with their morose walk 

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:58.000
 Two night owls in search of one more adventure 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 The clock shows twenty 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.500
 And the moon in its splendor illuminates the city 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 A subtle chant 

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:18.009
 Light the minds of those who in the gloom go 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.009
 I stop in time and ask where are you? 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 How many good news do I have to tell you? 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I move to the street 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.000
 And the traffic prevents me from crossing the track 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.500
 A man by my side 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 He gives me some wings and I start to fly 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 Submerged in the smoke I try to find 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 The secrets of star space 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Luna where are you I'm your crazy minstrel 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.800
 And on this intense night I try to reach you 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.800
 And even though I can get lost on the flight 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.600
 I know that at some point in this universe 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 You wait for me anxious and eager to love 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Crazy, how many times have they told me that I do not care anymore 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.000
 If everything is a dream 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Or is it the reality for which I made a path by walking 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.000
 Luna, where are you? I am your crazy minstrel 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.500
 And on this intense night I try to reach you 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.500
 And even though I can get lost on the flight 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.500
 I know that at some point in this universe 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.500
 You wait for me anxious And eager to love 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.500
 Eager to love
