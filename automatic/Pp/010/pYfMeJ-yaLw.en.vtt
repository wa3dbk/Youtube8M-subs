sure I think we should be able to take

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.670 
sure I think we should be able to take
down<00:02:02.399> most<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.030> them<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.530> two

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
down most of them but if we get like two

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
down most of them but if we get like two
or<00:02:04.799> three<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.040> them<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.579> same<00:02:05.759> spot<00:02:06.060> oh<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
or three of them in the same spot oh and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.580 
or three of them in the same spot oh and
they<00:02:06.719> could<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.439> more

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
they could be a little bit more

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.899 
they could be a little bit more
difficult<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.009> us

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909
