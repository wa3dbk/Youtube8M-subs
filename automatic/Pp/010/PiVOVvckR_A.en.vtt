00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
two billion tons a year hey do you

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.320 
two billion tons a year hey do you
dispute<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.530> if<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:51.830> they<00:04:52.520> say<00:04:52.760> at<00:04:53.000> that

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
dispute that and if so they say at that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.540 
dispute that and if so they say at that
figure<00:04:53.750> if<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.020> take<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.500> total<00:04:54.950> figure

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
figure if you take that total figure

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.610 
figure if you take that total figure
that<00:04:56.270> does<00:04:56.570> equate<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:56.990> being<00:04:57.350> one<00:04:57.470> of<00:04:57.500> the
