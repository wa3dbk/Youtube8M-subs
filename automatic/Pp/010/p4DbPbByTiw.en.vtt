and we'll make this wheel look brand new
alright<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.650> before<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.159> clean<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> we'll

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
alright now before we clean this we'll

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.630 
alright now before we clean this we'll
just<00:01:18.060> keep<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> mind<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.799> fanatic<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just keep in mind the fanatic and the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.560 
just keep in mind the fanatic and the
diamond<00:01:20.970> package<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:22.170> process<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.159> same

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
diamond package the process is the same

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
diamond package the process is the same
the<00:01:24.570> only<00:01:24.840> difference<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> chemical<00:01:25.950> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the only difference is the chemical so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
the only difference is the chemical so
I'm<00:01:26.430> using<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> same<00:01:27.360> tools<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I'm using all the same tools all the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'm using all the same tools all the
same<00:01:28.680> techniques<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.460> clean<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> wheel<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
same techniques to clean the wheel the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.810 
same techniques to clean the wheel the
only<00:01:30.990> difference<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.070> ammo<00:01:32.490> brute

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
only difference is is the ammo brute

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.410 
only difference is is the ammo brute
wheels<00:01:33.060> soap<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> ammo<00:01:34.170> plum<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.490> okay<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
wheels soap and the ammo plum so okay so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.210 
wheels soap and the ammo plum so okay so
that's<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> only<00:01:36.960> difference<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:38.040> now

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that's the only difference so right now

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
that's the only difference so right now
I'm<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> point<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> over<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'm going to point it over to here and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
I'm going to point it over to here and
as<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.689> whole<00:01:42.869> wheel<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.079> purple

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
as you can see the whole wheel is purple

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
as you can see the whole wheel is purple
and<00:01:43.770> I've<00:01:44.579> let<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> minute

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and I've let it set for about a minute

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
and I've let it set for about a minute
