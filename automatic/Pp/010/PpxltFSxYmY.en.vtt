00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
fighting was really really good like I

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.729 
fighting was really really good like I

mean<00:04:20.890> majority<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:22.060> episode<00:04:22.660> is

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
mean majority of this episode is

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.470 
mean majority of this episode is
fighting<00:04:23.710> it's<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.950> battle<00:04:24.520> orientate

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
fighting it's a battle orientate

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.050 
fighting it's a battle orientate
episode<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.370> taizai<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.580> i<00:04:27.610> think<00:04:27.850> there's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
episode of taizai and i think there's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.020 
episode of taizai and i think there's
quite<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.720> few<00:04:28.870> chapters<00:04:29.470> compressed<00:04:30.340> into

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
quite a few chapters compressed into

quite a few chapters compressed into
this<00:04:31.240> episode<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.750> think<00:04:31.930> five<00:04:32.380> maybe<00:04:33.190> five

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
this episode I think five maybe five

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.070 
this episode I think five maybe five
maybe<00:04:33.970> even<00:04:34.300> more<00:04:34.450> than<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.780> there<00:04:34.960> was<00:04:35.050> a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
maybe even more than that there was a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.500 
maybe even more than that there was a
lot<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.410> chapters<00:04:36.070> compressed<00:04:36.910> into<00:04:37.360> this

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
lot of chapters compressed into this

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.350 
lot of chapters compressed into this
episode<00:04:37.750> of<00:04:38.200> Titanic<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:39.310> ton<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:40.180> mean

it's just fighting orientated chapters

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.490 
it's just fighting orientated chapters
so<00:04:42.790> those<00:04:42.970> are<00:04:43.120> easier<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.570> animate<00:04:44.020> compared

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
