review on it since my pool water levels
below<00:02:56.640> what<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.090> should<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.510> because<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.959> my

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
below what it should be because of my

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.890 
below what it should be because of my
kids<00:02:59.060> therefore<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.120> makes<00:03:00.239> vacuuming<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
kids therefore it makes vacuuming a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.089 
kids therefore it makes vacuuming a
little<00:03:01.140> harder<00:03:03.680> here<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.250> pumps

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
little harder here we have the pumps

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.110 
little harder here we have the pumps
this<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.909> Intex<00:03:10.120> crystal-clear

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
this is the Intex crystal-clear

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.509 
this is the Intex crystal-clear
saltwater<00:03:11.659> system<00:03:12.790> does<00:03:13.790> an<00:03:13.939> excellent<00:03:14.209> job

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
saltwater system does an excellent job

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.979 
saltwater system does an excellent job
when<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.670> place<00:03:16.939> the<00:03:16.969> right<00:03:17.299> amount<00:03:17.569> of<00:03:17.659> salt

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
when you place the right amount of salt

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.539 
when you place the right amount of salt
in<00:03:18.170> your<00:03:18.200> pool<00:03:18.939> it<00:03:19.939> gets<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.329> soft<00:03:21.549> slight

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
in your pool it gets it a soft slight

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.550 
in your pool it gets it a soft slight
chlorine<00:03:23.299> feel<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.930> here<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.319> the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
chlorine feel and this here is the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.550 
chlorine feel and this here is the
in-text<00:03:28.689> sand<00:03:29.689> filter<00:03:31.450> which<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.840> am<00:03:33.500> very

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
in-text sand filter which I am very

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.610 
in-text sand filter which I am very

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
impressed with before I got this filter

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.140 
impressed with before I got this filter
I<00:03:36.650> had<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.099> filter<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.549> came<00:03:37.700> with<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:37.939> pool

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
which does an okay job on meanwhile but

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.099 
which does an okay job on meanwhile but
with<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.939> filter<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.420> came<00:03:44.629> with<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> pool
