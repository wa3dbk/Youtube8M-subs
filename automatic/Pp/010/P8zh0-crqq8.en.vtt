but<00:02:32.790> am<00:02:32.970> i<00:02:33.060> right<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.300> thinking<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.840> now<00:02:33.930> most

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
but am i right in thinking that now most

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.550 
but am i right in thinking that now most
of<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> Varens<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.099> actually<00:02:35.459> sold<00:02:36.349> yeah<00:02:37.349> we

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
of the Varens are actually sold yeah we

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.979 
of the Varens are actually sold yeah we
always<00:02:37.770> said<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.489> would<00:02:39.090> only<00:02:39.300> make<00:02:39.599> 300

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
always said that we would only make 300

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.119 
always said that we would only make 300
Veyrons<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.250> sold<00:02:41.489> meat<00:02:41.819> about<00:02:42.349> 260<00:02:43.349> that

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
Veyrons and we sold meat about 260 that

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.720 
Veyrons and we sold meat about 260 that
means<00:02:44.340> 40<00:02:44.849> left<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:46.230> assume<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.310> most<00:02:47.459> of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
means 40 left and I assume that most of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
means 40 left and I assume that most of
these<00:02:47.879> last<00:02:48.390> 40<00:02:48.900> will<00:02:49.080> be<00:02:49.230> Supersport<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.750> as

these last 40 will be Supersport and as

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
simply say artform technique which is

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.150 
simply say artform technique which is
all<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.330> nutshell<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:25.860> his<00:03:25.980> s

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
all in the nutshell and I think his s

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.210 
all in the nutshell and I think his s
true<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:26.880> true<00:03:26.940> today<00:03:27.540> as<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.930> was

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
true is this true today as it was

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.520 
true is this true today as it was
fifteen<00:03:29.220> hundred<00:03:29.520> years<00:03:29.580> ago<00:03:30.020> but<00:03:31.020> I<00:03:31.260> think

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
fifteen hundred years ago but I think

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.250 
fifteen hundred years ago but I think
today<00:03:32.190> we<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.520> added<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
today we have added to that the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.440 
today we have added to that the
positioning<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.920> Bugatti<00:03:35.340> has<00:03:35.700> always<00:03:36.150> been

very<00:03:36.720> high<00:03:37.020> but<00:03:37.680> there's<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.920> very<00:03:38.100> wrong<00:03:38.370> I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
very high but there's a very wrong I

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.550 
very high but there's a very wrong I
think<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.850> even<00:03:39.030> more<00:03:39.150> upmarket<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:40.050> that

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
think it's even more upmarket and that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.170 
think it's even more upmarket and that
is<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.710> unique<00:03:40.950> position<00:03:41.490> and<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.000> great

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
fins sitting in the air intakes and we

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.180 
fins sitting in the air intakes and we
have<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.720> bottom<00:04:34.050> spoiler<00:04:34.440> lip<00:04:34.470> generating<00:04:35.100> a

have a bottom spoiler lip generating a
lot<00:04:35.310> more<00:04:35.490> downforce<00:04:35.970> than<00:04:36.090> what<00:04:36.570> we<00:04:36.690> had

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
lot more downforce than what we had

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.040 
lot more downforce than what we had
before<00:04:37.700> also<00:04:38.700> we<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.150> air<00:04:39.330> intakes<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.960> the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
before also we have air intakes for the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.480 
before also we have air intakes for the
brake<00:04:40.260> cooling<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.740> now<00:04:40.830> under<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> light

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
brake cooling and now under the light

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.240 
brake cooling and now under the light
and<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:42.720> starts<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.200> air<00:04:43.440> directly<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:44.130> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
and this starts the air directly to the

plan<00:04:49.530> much<00:04:50.310> more<00:04:50.580> sharp<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.419> allow<00:04:51.990> for

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
plan much more sharp so to allow for

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.020 
plan much more sharp so to allow for
more<00:04:52.410> air<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.860> go<00:04:53.010> inside<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.580> opposed<00:04:53.910> to

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
more air to go inside as opposed to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.790 
more air to go inside as opposed to
going<00:04:54.240> over

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
going over

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.580 
going over
the<00:04:54.889> air<00:04:55.849> that<00:04:56.180> comes<00:04:56.449> here<00:04:56.659> streams<00:04:57.169> over<00:04:57.349> the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
the air that comes here streams over the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.309 
the air that comes here streams over the
edge<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:57.949> as<00:04:58.099> a<00:04:58.129> tear<00:04:58.400> off<00:04:58.580> edge<00:04:58.819> here<00:04:59.319> and

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
edge and as a tear off edge here and

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.930 
edge and as a tear off edge here and
that<00:05:00.500> allows<00:05:00.740> for<00:05:00.849> creating<00:05:01.849> an

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
that allows for creating an

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.670 
that allows for creating an
under-pressure<00:05:02.180> area<00:05:02.810> here<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.409> the<00:05:03.530> air

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
under-pressure area here so that the air

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.529 
under-pressure area here so that the air
flowing<00:05:04.129> over<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.639> actually<00:05:05.000> sucks<00:05:05.300> out<00:05:05.509> the

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
flowing over this actually sucks out the

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.170 
flowing over this actually sucks out the
air<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.080> comes<00:05:06.259> here<00:05:06.500> in<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.680> front<00:05:07.180> that

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
air that comes here in the front that

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.360 
air that comes here in the front that
makes<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.659> radiator<00:05:08.990> much<00:05:09.289> more<00:05:09.590> efficient

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
makes the radiator much more efficient

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.180 
makes the radiator much more efficient
and<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.389> allows<00:05:11.750> for<00:05:12.080> cooling<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.680> 1,200

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
and so allows for cooling the 1,200

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.070 
and so allows for cooling the 1,200
horsepower<00:05:13.280> which<00:05:13.759> we<00:05:13.909> need<00:05:14.060> going<00:05:14.870> around

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
horsepower which we need going around

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.480 
horsepower which we need going around

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
the side of the car you see the low

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.969 
the side of the car you see the low
slung<00:05:16.819> silhouette<00:05:17.470> which<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.590> made<00:05:18.770> possible

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
slung silhouette which is made possible

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.939 
slung silhouette which is made possible
by<00:05:19.280> introducing<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:20.090> NACA<00:05:20.270> ducts<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:21.650> NACA

spoiler<00:05:59.120> which<00:05:59.509> we<00:06:00.110> now<00:06:00.590> put<00:06:00.860> at<00:06:01.009> different

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
spoiler which we now put at different

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.390 
spoiler which we now put at different
angles<00:06:02.289> and<00:06:03.289> we<00:06:03.590> were<00:06:03.710> able<00:06:03.979> to<00:06:04.009> actually

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
angles and we were able to actually

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.269 
angles and we were able to actually
reduce<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:05.210> angle<00:06:05.599> because<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.440> spoiler<00:06:07.130> is

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
reduce the angle because the spoiler is

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.620 
reduce the angle because the spoiler is
much<00:06:07.460> more<00:06:07.639> efficient<00:06:08.060> because<00:06:08.120> the<00:06:08.330> roof<00:06:08.509> is

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
much more efficient because the roof is

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.300 
much more efficient because the roof is

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
is a very difficult question because

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.250 
is a very difficult question because
normally<00:07:10.970> I<00:07:11.000> would<00:07:11.240> tend<00:07:11.480> to<00:07:11.630> prefer<00:07:11.930> the

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 
normally I would tend to prefer the

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260 
normally I would tend to prefer the
smaller<00:07:12.590> cars<00:07:12.890> in<00:07:13.220> the<00:07:13.370> earlier<00:07:13.610> cars<00:07:13.850> but<00:07:14.150> if

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
smaller cars in the earlier cars but if

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.060 
smaller cars in the earlier cars but if
