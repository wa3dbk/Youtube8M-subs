named the VG 1 the VG 2 VG 3 etc well

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.990 
named the VG 1 the VG 2 VG 3 etc well
the<00:01:14.000> VG<00:01:14.240> 1<00:01:14.360> was<00:01:14.570> Walters<00:01:14.960> design<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.670> very

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
the VG 1 was Walters design it's a very

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.109 
the VG 1 was Walters design it's a very
much<00:01:17.180> simplified<00:01:18.700> basically<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.759> Mauser

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
much simplified basically a Mauser

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.669 
much simplified basically a Mauser
bolt-action<00:01:20.750> well<00:01:20.929> we'll<00:01:21.200> take<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.380> closer

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
bolt-action well we'll take a closer

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.709 
bolt-action well we'll take a closer
look<00:01:21.799> at<00:01:22.159> at<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.820> operation<00:01:23.359> here<00:01:23.539> in<00:01:23.570> a

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
look at at the operation here in a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.639 
look at at the operation here in a
moment<00:01:23.840> but<00:01:24.649> very<00:01:25.549> simple<00:01:25.909> stock<00:01:26.649> extremely

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
moment but very simple stock extremely

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.200 
moment but very simple stock extremely
simple<00:01:28.070> sights<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:28.759> see<00:01:29.000> there's

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
simple sights you can see there's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.419 
simple sights you can see there's
basically<00:01:30.109> nothing<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.859> it<00:01:30.979> just<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.249> little

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
basically nothing to it just a little

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.410 
basically nothing to it just a little
plate<00:01:31.700> with<00:01:31.999> a<00:01:32.030> notch<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.759> front<00:01:35.210> post

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
plate with a notch and a front post

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.219 
plate with a notch and a front post
there<00:01:35.749> the<00:01:36.409> barrels<00:01:36.859> were<00:01:36.979> generally<00:01:38.229> machine

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
there the barrels were generally machine

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.489 
there the barrels were generally machine
gun<00:01:39.350> barrels<00:01:39.710> mg<00:01:40.100> 15<00:01:40.369> or<00:01:40.850> 17<00:01:41.179> or<00:01:41.630> 81<00:01:41.929> barrels

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.029 
gun barrels mg 15 or 17 or 81 barrels
that<00:01:43.249> had<00:01:43.429> been<00:01:43.640> salvaged<00:01:44.600> or<00:01:44.749> not<00:01:45.170> ever<00:01:45.350> used

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
that had been salvaged or not ever used

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.209 
that had been salvaged or not ever used
in<00:01:46.399> an<00:01:46.810> aerial<00:01:47.810> machine<00:01:48.079> gun<00:01:48.259> production

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.770 

safety<00:01:52.219> here<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:52.549> is<00:01:52.819> kind<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.240> interesting

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
safety here is is kind of interesting

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.129 
safety here is is kind of interesting
also<00:01:54.380> very<00:01:54.829> very<00:01:55.130> simple<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:56.179> bit<00:01:56.749> just

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
also very very simple this bit just

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.309 
also very very simple this bit just
pivots<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:58.060> when<00:01:59.060> it's<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.569> the<00:01:59.840> center<00:02:00.139> like

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
pivots so when it's in the center like

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.800 
pivots so when it's in the center like
that<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.889> trigger<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.399> move<00:02:01.579> when<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:02.600> push

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
that the trigger can move when you push

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.989 
that the trigger can move when you push
it<00:02:02.960> down<00:02:03.109> it<00:02:03.799> physically<00:02:04.340> blocks<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.759> trigger

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
it down it physically blocks the trigger

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.789 
it down it physically blocks the trigger
that's<00:02:05.569> all<00:02:05.840> there<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.439> safety<00:02:06.770> on

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
that's all there is to the safety on

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.919 
that's all there is to the safety on
this<00:02:07.009> now<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.880> magazine<00:02:08.360> isn't<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.810> this

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
this now the magazine isn't in this

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.130 
this now the magazine isn't in this
rifle<00:02:09.170> at<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.410> moment<00:02:09.710> but<00:02:09.890> these<00:02:10.100> used

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
rifle at the moment but these used

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.970 
rifle at the moment but these used
Gewehr<00:02:12.140> 43<00:02:12.170> mags

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
Gewehr 43 mags

chambered an eight millimeter mauser

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.610 
chambered an eight millimeter mauser
they<00:02:16.430> have<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.580> little<00:02:16.730> magazine<00:02:16.880> catch<00:02:17.620> right

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620

hacked<00:02:27.890> out<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.430> as<00:02:28.760> little<00:02:29.060> time<00:02:29.270> as<00:02:29.300> possible

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
hacked out in as little time as possible

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.440 
hacked out in as little time as possible
just<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.110> work<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:31.490> front<00:02:31.610> sling<00:02:32.000> swivel<00:02:32.390> is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
just to work the front sling swivel is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.530 
just to work the front sling swivel is
another<00:02:32.690> good<00:02:32.870> example<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.490> level<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
another good example of the level of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.510 
another good example of the level of
desperation<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.290> was<00:02:36.560> being<00:02:36.800> put<00:02:37.190> into<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
desperation that was being put into the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.640 
desperation that was being put into the
manufacture<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.150> these<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:39.080> it's<00:02:39.230> basically<00:02:39.530> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
manufacture of these so it's basically a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.890 
manufacture of these so it's basically a
bent<00:02:39.890> piece<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.310> wire<00:02:40.490> hole<00:02:41.270> drilled<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.780> the
