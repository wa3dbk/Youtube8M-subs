news<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> reason<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.640> doing<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
news and the reason I'm doing this is

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.190 
news and the reason I'm doing this is
because<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.850> oh<00:00:32.850> no<00:00:32.969> I've<00:00:33.239> been<00:00:33.480> struggling<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because I oh no I've been struggling to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
because I oh no I've been struggling to
get<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> nukes<00:00:34.770> off<00:00:35.149> just<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.950> 7-eleven<00:00:37.950> 25

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
get the nukes off just the 7-eleven 25

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
get the nukes off just the 7-eleven 25
and<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> thought<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> might<00:00:39.719> try<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.079> out

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and I thought that I might try this out

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
and I thought that I might try this out
and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> first<00:00:41.850> game<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I think this is the first game I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
and I think this is the first game I
actually<00:00:42.420> put<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:43.920> getting<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
actually put it on I end up getting a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.119 
actually put it on I end up getting a
new<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.719> works<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.530> pretty<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.920> me

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
new so it works out pretty well for me

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
new so it works out pretty well for me
only<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.700> problem<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
only the problem is you have to get the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.400 
only the problem is you have to get the
9<00:00:48.989> kills<00:00:49.320> dead<00:00:49.559> animal<00:00:49.890> 7<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.050> instead<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> new

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
9 kills dead animal 7 so instead of new

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
9 kills dead animal 7 so instead of new
clean<00:00:52.649> e7<00:00:53.309> kill<00:00:53.489> streak<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> 9<00:00:54.120> kill

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
clean e7 kill streak it's a 9 kill

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.410 
clean e7 kill streak it's a 9 kill
streak<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.899> quite<00:00:55.860> difficult<00:00:56.100> oh<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.180> yeah

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
streak so quite difficult oh no but yeah

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.130 
streak so quite difficult oh no but yeah
so<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.800> cave<00:00:59.129> low<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so if you get that cave low you can the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
so if you get that cave low you can the
reason<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:01.859> using<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.250> chopper<00:01:02.520> dinners

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
reason I'm not using the chopper dinners

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.039 
reason I'm not using the chopper dinners
because<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.120> got<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> pay<00:01:03.449> blow<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> still

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
because I got a pay blow like it's still

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.859 
because I got a pay blow like it's still
colonies<00:01:04.470> 130<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.280> need<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.720> like

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
colonies 130 if I need to if it's like

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
colonies 130 if I need to if it's like
close<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> end<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> game<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.100> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
close to the end of the game and I just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
close to the end of the game and I just
need<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> kill<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.750> still<00:01:09.960> call

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
need to get the kill so I can still call

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.620 
need to get the kill so I can still call
in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> ec-130j<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.850> pave<00:01:12.060> lows<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.479> they'd

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
in the ec-130j the pave lows like they'd

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.410 
in the ec-130j the pave lows like they'd
get<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:13.020> kills<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.909> why<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.270> using

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
get more kills so that's why I'm using

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
get more kills so that's why I'm using
it<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:16.049> I'd<00:01:16.290> rather<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> 2<00:01:17.070> kills

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it because I'd rather get the 2 kills

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.280 
it because I'd rather get the 2 kills
before<00:01:18.619> I'm<00:01:19.619> close<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> e<00:01:20.189> 25<00:01:20.610> kill<00:01:20.850> streak<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
think it's been pretty good it looks

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.889 
think it's been pretty good it looks
like<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.990> has<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:50.490> doesn't<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like it has it doesn't have a lot of the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.980 
like it has it doesn't have a lot of the
flaws<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.409> more<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:52.920> -<00:01:53.040> had<00:01:53.990> for

flaws of that more for - had for

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
flaws of that more for - had for
instance<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.880> man<00:01:57.030> army

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.270

look<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.210> more<00:02:00.360> balanced<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> perk

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
look a little more balanced the perk

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.749 
look a little more balanced the perk
balancing<00:02:02.880> looks<00:02:03.210> odd<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:05.579> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
balancing looks odd just because it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
balancing looks odd just because it's
different<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.270> before<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.960> no

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
stopping power really changes things but

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.930 
stopping power really changes things but
um

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
um

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.030 
um
it<00:02:10.510> doesn't<00:02:10.810> have<00:02:10.960> commando<00:02:11.410> which<00:02:11.530> I'm<00:02:11.770> very

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
it doesn't have commando which I'm very

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.980 
it doesn't have commando which I'm very
happy<00:02:12.520> about<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:13.060> doesn't<00:02:13.390> look<00:02:13.630> like<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.960> has

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
happy about it doesn't look like it has

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.660 
happy about it doesn't look like it has
any<00:02:14.110> perks<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:14.800> ridiculous<00:02:15.520> or

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
any perks that are ridiculous or

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.250 
any perks that are ridiculous or
anything<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.150> nothing<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.140> looks

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
anything like that nothing that looks

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.690 
anything like that nothing that looks
like<00:02:17.440> it's<00:02:17.590> gonna<00:02:17.680> become<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.100> new<00:02:18.220> commando

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
like it's gonna become the new commando

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.170 
like it's gonna become the new commando
so<00:02:19.420> I'm<00:02:19.690> quite<00:02:20.110> happy<00:02:20.290> about<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.180> definitely

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
so I'm quite happy about that definitely

a<00:02:37.060> hundred<00:02:37.300> sure<00:02:37.810> about<00:02:38.280> are<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> spawns<00:02:39.700> I'm

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
a hundred sure about are the spawns I'm

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.210 
a hundred sure about are the spawns I'm
wondering<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:40.870> they<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:40.990> fixed<00:02:41.440> spawns<00:02:41.860> I

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
wondering if they have fixed spawns I

wondering if they have fixed spawns I
was<00:02:42.880> actually<00:02:43.030> playing<00:02:43.300> Cod<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.780> today<00:02:44.080> and

was actually playing Cod for today and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.440 
was actually playing Cod for today and
the<00:02:44.950> spawns<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.460> my<00:02:45.580> work<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:45.880> two<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.120> better

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
the spawns of my work for two are better

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.930 
the spawns of my work for two are better
than<00:02:46.570> cod<00:02:46.900> four<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:48.250> they're<00:02:48.700> still<00:02:48.880> not

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
perfect I'm hoping that Treyarch

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.240 
perfect I'm hoping that Treyarch
improved<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.970> spawns<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.860> long<00:02:54.100> were

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
improved the spawns from what long were

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.460 
improved the spawns from what long were
that<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.550> had<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.940> even<00:02:55.510> use<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> similar

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
that you had a even use a similar

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.940 
that you had a even use a similar
spawning<00:02:56.770> system<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:58.420> trailer<00:02:59.410> tents<00:02:59.770> have

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
spawning system but trailer tents have

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.210 
spawning system but trailer tents have
bigger<00:03:00.490> Maps<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:02.320> that<00:03:02.470> should<00:03:02.770> fix<00:03:02.980> some<00:03:03.190> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
bigger Maps so that should fix some of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.950 
bigger Maps so that should fix some of
the<00:03:03.310> spawn<00:03:03.520> problems<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.210> gun<00:03:04.420> and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
the spawn problems like gun and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.280 
the spawn problems like gun and
absolutely<00:03:06.180> scrapyard<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:08.080> hate<00:03:08.260> that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
absolutely scrapyard I really hate that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.040 
absolutely scrapyard I really hate that
map<00:03:08.860> because<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.580> know<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.240> people<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.810> tend

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
map because I know as people just tend

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.200 
map because I know as people just tend
to<00:03:11.170> spawn<00:03:11.410> five<00:03:11.740> feet<00:03:11.980> away<00:03:12.100> from<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.520> so

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
to spawn five feet away from you and so

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.030 
to spawn five feet away from you and so
many<00:03:13.390> times<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.840> see<00:03:14.020> myself<00:03:14.200> killing<00:03:14.650> somebody

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
many times I see myself killing somebody

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.630 
many times I see myself killing somebody
in<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> killcam<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.680> I'm<00:03:17.680> hoping<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
in the killcam so I'm hoping that the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.060 
in the killcam so I'm hoping that the
bigger<00:03:18.820> maps<00:03:19.120> will<00:03:19.420> solve<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.950> only

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
bigger maps will solve that the only

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.229 
bigger maps will solve that the only
thing<00:03:21.220> I'm<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> little<00:03:21.640> worried<00:03:21.850> about<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.209> that

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
thing I'm a little worried about is that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.720 
thing I'm a little worried about is that
they<00:03:22.480> don't<00:03:22.630> make<00:03:22.750> them<00:03:23.070> ridiculously<00:03:24.070> large

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
they don't make them ridiculously large

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.570 
they don't make them ridiculously large
like<00:03:25.120> world<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:25.570> war<00:03:25.750> maps<00:03:26.160> most<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.370> map

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
like world at war maps most the map

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.790 
like world at war maps most the map
wasn't<00:03:27.940> used<00:03:28.180> most<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> time<00:03:28.870> you'd<00:03:29.650> be

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
wasn't used most of the time you'd be

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.220 
wasn't used most of the time you'd be
using<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.220> 10%<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.970> map<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.840> I'm<00:03:31.989> hoping

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
using like 10% of the map so I'm hoping

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.750 
using like 10% of the map so I'm hoping
that<00:03:32.380> they<00:03:32.650> they<00:03:32.980> make<00:03:33.190> maps

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
that they they make maps

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.430 
that they they make maps
you<00:03:34.030> know<00:03:34.120> reasonably<00:03:34.720> sized<00:03:34.989> not<00:03:35.440> not<00:03:35.980> too

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
you know reasonably sized not not too

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.720 
you know reasonably sized not not too
oversized<00:03:38.440> or<00:03:38.620> anything<00:03:38.830> like<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:41.730> I'm

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
oversized or anything like that I I'm

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.380 
oversized or anything like that I I'm
not<00:03:42.910> sure<00:03:43.209> if<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.840> game<00:03:44.380> will<00:03:44.530> have<00:03:44.650> camping

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
not sure if that game will have camping

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.540 
not sure if that game will have camping
really<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.750> camping<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.380> dependent<00:03:48.340> on<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
really the camping is dependent on the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.880 
really the camping is dependent on the
community<00:03:48.989> they<00:03:49.989> still<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.410> some<00:03:50.739> high

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
community they still have some high

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.070 
community they still have some high
killstreaks<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.790> you're<00:03:52.480> probably<00:03:52.780> still

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
killstreaks so you're probably still

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.870 
killstreaks so you're probably still
gonna<00:03:53.260> get<00:03:53.410> some<00:03:53.590> people<00:03:53.860> who<00:03:53.980> are<00:03:54.100> looking

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
gonna get some people who are looking

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.120 
gonna get some people who are looking
for<00:03:55.209> their<00:03:55.450> their<00:03:56.110> high<00:03:56.290> streaks<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.920> gonna

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
for their their high streaks and gonna

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.070 
for their their high streaks and gonna
be<00:03:57.280> hiding<00:03:57.489> corners<00:03:58.060> they<00:03:58.780> don't<00:03:58.959> have

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
be hiding corners they don't have

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.120 
be hiding corners they don't have
scavenger<00:03:59.590> claymores<00:03:59.980> anymore<00:04:00.340> which<00:04:02.130> well

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
scavenger claymores anymore which well

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.170 
scavenger claymores anymore which well
you<00:04:03.580> can't<00:04:03.820> scavenge<00:04:04.390> claymores<00:04:04.780> anymore<00:04:05.140> so

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you can't scavenge claymores anymore so

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.580 
you can't scavenge claymores anymore so
you<00:04:07.180> might<00:04:07.390> have<00:04:07.570> people<00:04:07.989> can<00:04:08.380> pay<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> little

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
you might have people can pay a little

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.199 
you might have people can pay a little
less<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.850> yeah<00:04:11.310> really<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.670> depends<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
less but yeah really just depends on the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.490 
less but yeah really just depends on the
community<00:04:13.360> whether<00:04:13.870> or<00:04:14.050> not<00:04:14.140> people<00:04:14.440> are

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
community whether or not people are

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.199 
community whether or not people are
going<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.800> sit<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.280> dark<00:04:15.459> corner<00:04:15.850> what

nuke<00:05:44.610> for<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.120> win<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.110> thought<00:05:46.470> that<00:05:46.620> was<00:05:46.710> a

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
nuke for the win so I thought that was a

pretty<00:05:46.950> cool<00:05:47.130> game<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.520> have<00:05:47.780> final<00:05:48.780> score<00:05:48.990> I

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
pretty cool game to have final score I

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.710
