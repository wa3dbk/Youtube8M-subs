00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.650
 creamy cleansing milk that allows me 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 to do a massage as well as to be 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.340
 liquid detergent when you move the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 if you do it slow this massage can 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.800
 make the client relax a lot because if 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.530

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.099

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.110

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:27.320

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:30.320

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.350
 the feel of the warm and very cloth 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:47.250
