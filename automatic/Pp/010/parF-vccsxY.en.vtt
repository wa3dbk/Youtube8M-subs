00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.520
 category of videos that we do not have 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.440
 really on halo qg we 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.179
 had a little bit early in the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.880

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.679
 little bit to the taste of the day and it's 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.920
 always your clips it's you who 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.810

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.630
 content in the chain so do not hesitate 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.369
 especially not to send them from elsewhere 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.220

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.709
 for now it's a beta version of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.720
 top fail to see how it's going to work 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.190
 if it will work if you're interested 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.440
 so there are no categories 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.959
 Main families has no categories 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.290

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.489
 description at the very bottom of the form 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.940
 even in campaigns you have a fail 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.860
 you send it to us and if it's good and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.530
 Ben it will end up in the video 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.120
 presented by tc to kill at 117 here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.770
 present I'll leave you a little bit 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.020
 more explained how the video is going to get 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.130
 so go yes so you do so if 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.240
 you are watching videos right at 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.760
 left on youtube you probably have 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.350
 already heard of the top 10 so early 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.070
 does it will take a little bit back the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.150
 same concept 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.670
 so that is to say that there will be a 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.050
 ranking 2 10 clip that you will have us 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.850
 sent 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.000
 except that unlike the top 10 that 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.030
 not going to be super stock 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.830
 awesome crazy clips or 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.640
 whatever if it's going to be 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.160
 except that it will be facts that's like 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.890
 the title of the video indicate it will be 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.840
 thus does not please you to 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.060
 send us all your clips where you have 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.180
 facts stuff not because the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.770
 video is based on fun so I know 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.600
 not me you are a warthog where the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.070
 crush an enemy but there your ally 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.290
 arrives in high gironde and gets killed 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.390
 in its place here are actions like that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.550
 that's what we want and so that's it 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.739
 big it takes the concept of the files of 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.239
 the weak of rooster teeth 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.930
 frankly not because I think that 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.670
 it's worth it 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.920
 I think there is a way to take 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.739
 big delusions by commenting on this 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.580
