00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:11.700
 and so shorter the path of the new sample and 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:15.620
 the receiver have a function in driving mode 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 let's say the remote lost contact with 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.830
 receiver and machine 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.430
 how should go and go and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.980
 bumps i mean the connection is lost and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.860
 set speed 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 is set to the receiver and goes well and it will not 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.590
 reacts in general the machine is not 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 stops but in this receiver and 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:46.860
 Remote as I explained there is a file mode 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.079
 called safe here well, that is when 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.739
 loss of signal the machine stops 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 Now we will try to understand and in general 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.540
 immediately turn on the remote 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:08.150
 check whether this mode is configured or not 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.150
 turn on the remote and then connect 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 turn on the machine ask attention 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:50.680
 the remote is off the machine goes turn on 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:50.680
 the machine became check again 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.030
 does tea work okay everything is possible 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.490
 turn off 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 be sure to remember first always when 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.240
 Startup, the path is turned on, then the machine 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.560
 turn off the machine then the remote to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:21.340
 this was not 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:24.950
 that's how the file mode was explained to me 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.760
 includes turn on the machine 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:40.970
 The remote control is immediately excluded, then 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:44.030
 car as we have seen the regime does not have it 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.400
 and the bulb and the button turn on clamp 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.400
 to start fast 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:21.489
 That was something Vova 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:24.250
 now set up answering disconnecting 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.700
 the remote machine stops all mode 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.040
 are set up that is again how are we all 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.400
 do we turn on the remote 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.220
 turn on the machine then click here 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.220
 Try me a little closer now 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:52.220
 I will remove the flash or make the button lit 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.099
 we press and hold it until it starts 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.879
 very quickly flash immediately minutes slowly 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:04.810
 then he quickly leaves 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.810
 keep slowly minutes 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.240
 once again pressed the problem la quickly everything about 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.459
 a lot of quickly, that is, we press once 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.220
 hold keep start blinking 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.670
 then again press and hold 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:39.290
 ran quickly three times and letting go 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:42.880
 and everything and try again all machine as 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:51.110
 see it all stopped turning off the car 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:52.970
 as I said, and what's the catch will be 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.730
 disable what's funny 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.820
 need to buy extra feeder on 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:03.340
 In general, I know the chip files and 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.340
 not to use the channel thanks
