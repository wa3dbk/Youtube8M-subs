00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
I'm just going around and building up

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.990 
I'm just going around and building up
like<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.139> I'm<00:04:43.860> going<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.220> take<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.669> little

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
like that and I'm going to take a little

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.719 
like that and I'm going to take a little
spoonful<00:04:45.659> of<00:04:45.930> my<00:04:46.289> ganache<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:47.070> always<00:04:47.490> find

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
spoonful of my ganache I always find

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.610 
spoonful of my ganache I always find
when<00:04:47.909> I'm<00:04:48.000> doing<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.389> sort<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.870> step<00:04:49.139> that

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
when I'm doing this sort of a step that

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.050 
when I'm doing this sort of a step that
you<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:49.919> want<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.220> do<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> little<00:04:50.760> bit<00:04:50.880> at<00:04:51.030> a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
you just want to do a little bit at a

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.750 
you just want to do a little bit at a
time<00:04:51.389> because<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.380> will<00:04:52.560> tend<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.949> run<00:04:53.250> quite<00:04:53.729> a

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
time because it will tend to run quite a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.629 
time because it will tend to run quite a
bit<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.650> don't<00:04:55.650> want<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.979> be<00:04:56.099> too<00:04:56.340> too

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
bit and don't want it to be too too

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.149 
bit and don't want it to be too too
messy<00:04:57.289> so<00:04:58.289> it's<00:04:58.440> just<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.770> come<00:04:59.010> down

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
messy so it's just going to come down

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.029 
messy so it's just going to come down
here<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.639> can<00:04:59.669> coax<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.330> little<00:05:00.479> bit

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
here and you can coax it a little bit

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.390 
here and you can coax it a little bit
pushing<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.310> like<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:03.889> I'll<00:05:04.889> do<00:05:05.039> a<00:05:05.099> little

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
pushing it like that I'll do a little

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.330 
pushing it like that I'll do a little
bit<00:05:05.669> more<00:05:05.909> I<00:05:05.940> think<00:05:08.270> there<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.510> go<00:05:10.039> kind<00:05:11.039> of<00:05:11.159> too

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
bit more I think there we go kind of too

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.450 
bit more I think there we go kind of too
much<00:05:11.490> right<00:05:12.740> chocolate<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:13.860> banana<00:05:14.219> and
