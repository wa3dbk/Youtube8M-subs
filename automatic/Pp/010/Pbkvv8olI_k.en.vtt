00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640 
all three of them so I'm pretty sure
it'll<00:02:19.090> work<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.630> spun<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.170> same<00:02:20.320> spot

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
it'll work and I spun on the same spot

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.510 
it'll work and I spun on the same spot
every<00:02:20.680> time<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:23.040> guess<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.070> means<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
every time so I guess that means that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.510 
every time so I guess that means that
they<00:02:24.640> work<00:02:26.070> anyways<00:02:27.070> um<00:02:28.950> we'll<00:02:29.950> go<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
they work anyways um we'll go to the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:39.840 
they work anyways um we'll go to the
next<00:02:30.790> one<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.910> next<00:02:33.940> one<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:36.840> 8<00:02:37.840> 8<00:02:38.140> 8<00:02:38.820> 24<00:02:39.820> 8

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
next one and the next one is 8 8 8 24 8

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:50.520 
next one and the next one is 8 8 8 24 8
I<00:02:40.180> believe<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.850> don't<00:02:49.690> think<00:02:49.750> wait

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
I believe this one I don't think wait

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.500 
I believe this one I don't think wait
yeah<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.670> spawn<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> snow<00:02:52.390> as

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
yeah this one you spawn on the snow as

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.810 
yeah this one you spawn on the snow as
well<00:02:52.720> right<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.350> snow<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:56.370> let's<00:02:57.370> give<00:02:57.790> it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
well right on the snow so let's give it

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:53.550 
well right on the snow so let's give it
a<00:02:57.910> go<00:02:57.940> or<00:03:16.800> 90<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.470> right<00:03:32.680> one<00:03:52.200> let's<00:03:53.200> try

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
a go or 90 is the right one let's try

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:17.410 
a go or 90 is the right one let's try
that<00:03:53.800> one<00:03:53.860> again

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.180 

hoping<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:18.540> works<00:04:20.690> there<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.780> go<00:04:22.019> okay<00:04:22.800> see

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
hoping it works there you go okay see

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.710 
hoping it works there you go okay see
that's<00:04:23.940> word<00:04:24.890> huh<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:26.670> was<00:04:26.790> weird<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.240> it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
that's word huh that was weird and it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.360 
that's word huh that was weird and it
was<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.050> first<00:04:28.080> time<00:04:28.350> i<00:04:28.410> did<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:28.920> i<00:04:28.950> guess<00:04:29.220> if

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
was the first time i did so i guess if

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.300 
was the first time i did so i guess if
it<00:04:29.490> doesn't<00:04:29.820> doubt<00:04:30.000> if<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.480> 888<00:04:31.050> 248<00:04:31.950> doesn't

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
it doesn't doubt if the 888 248 doesn't

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.810 
it doesn't doubt if the 888 248 doesn't
work<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.760> first<00:04:32.790> time<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.780> delete<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.440> or

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
work the first time just delete it or

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.480 
work the first time just delete it or
redo<00:04:35.820> anyone<00:04:36.890> because<00:04:37.890> this<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.160> what<00:04:38.340> it

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
redo anyone because this is what it

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.280 
redo anyone because this is what it
should<00:04:38.520> look<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.000> there's<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.780> swamp<00:04:40.080> right

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
should look like there's a swamp right

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.330 
should look like there's a swamp right
next<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.650> like<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:41.100> whole<00:04:41.250> snow<00:04:41.550> area<00:04:42.360> and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
next to like the whole snow area and

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.220 
next to like the whole snow area and
like<00:04:44.340> i<00:04:44.520> said<00:04:44.580> have<00:04:44.910> an<00:04:45.000> explorer<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:45.810> i'll

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
like i said have an explorer it so i'll

00:04:46.230 --> 00:05:02.350 
like i said have an explorer it so i'll
just<00:04:46.500> show<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.680> what<00:04:47.540> around<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.660> bit

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.670 

and<00:05:03.360> as<00:05:03.719> you<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.020> if<00:05:04.199> you<00:05:04.259> see<00:05:04.409> underneath

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
and as you can see if you see underneath

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:18.649 
and as you can see if you see underneath
the<00:05:04.860> map<00:05:05.069> there's<00:05:07.370> okay<00:05:17.150> but<00:05:18.150> yeah<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:18.599> is

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
the map there's okay but yeah this is

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.140 
the map there's okay but yeah this is
the<00:05:18.900> second<00:05:19.289> one<00:05:19.439> so<00:05:20.039> i<00:05:20.069> guess<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.729> second<00:05:21.029> one

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
the second one so i guess the second one

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.619 
the second one so i guess the second one
kind<00:05:21.749> of<00:05:21.839> works<00:05:22.490> like<00:05:23.490> i<00:05:23.639> said<00:05:23.849> if<00:05:23.999> it<00:05:24.180> spawns

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
kind of works like i said if it spawns

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.719 
kind of works like i said if it spawns
you<00:05:24.779> somewhere<00:05:25.110> else<00:05:25.289> try<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.860> again<00:05:25.949> like<00:05:26.580> I

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
you somewhere else try it again like I

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.860 
you somewhere else try it again like I
did<00:05:26.759> and<00:05:27.259> it<00:05:28.259> should<00:05:28.710> work<00:05:29.069> hopefully<00:05:29.879> if<00:05:30.569> not

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
did and it should work hopefully if not

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.709 
did and it should work hopefully if not
tried<00:05:31.529> the<00:05:31.830> other<00:05:31.860> two<00:05:32.249> them<00:05:32.400> dealer<00:05:32.849> to<00:05:33.029> work

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
tried the other two them dealer to work

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.510 
tried the other two them dealer to work

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
right next to the spawn so there's rain
