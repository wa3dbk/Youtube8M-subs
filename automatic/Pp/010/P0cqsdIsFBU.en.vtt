00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
dioxide why not come and have a look at
what's<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.200> each<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.100> these<00:00:38.220> domes

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
what's going on in each of these domes

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.670 
what's going on in each of these domes
we've<00:00:38.880> got<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> selection<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.870> plants<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
we've got a selection of plants and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.049 
we've got a selection of plants and
we're<00:00:40.949> growing<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.340> under<00:00:41.579> different

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we're growing them under different

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
we're growing them under different
conditions<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.199> that<00:00:43.469> affects<00:00:43.890> their

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
conditions to see how that affects their

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.840 
conditions to see how that affects their
growth<00:00:44.690> inside<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> what's<00:00:47.370> special<00:00:47.640> about

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
growth inside so what's special about

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.689 
growth inside so what's special about
this<00:00:48.149> doe<00:00:48.449> it<00:00:48.629> feels<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.469> outside<00:00:50.039> well

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
this doe it feels just like outside well

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.430 
this doe it feels just like outside well
the<00:00:50.789> temperature<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.480> exactly<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.289> as

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the temperature is exactly the same as

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.020 
the temperature is exactly the same as
outside<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.100> what's<00:00:53.340> different<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
outside but what's different is the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
outside but what's different is the
carbon<00:00:54.420> dioxide<00:00:55.050> levels<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.739> actually

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
carbon dioxide levels are actually

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700 
carbon dioxide levels are actually
double<00:00:56.489> outside<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> can't<00:00:58.320> tell<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
double outside really I can't tell the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.130 
double outside really I can't tell the
difference<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.190> can't<00:00:59.429> see<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.879> or<00:00:59.969> feel<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> no

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
difference I can't see it or feel it no

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.529 
difference I can't see it or feel it no
but<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.769> all<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.460> equipment<00:01:02.820> here

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
but this is what all this equipment here

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.299 
but this is what all this equipment here
is<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> noise<00:01:04.590> is<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.160> we're

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
is for and the noise is it we're

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
is for and the noise is it we're
actually<00:01:05.460> taking<00:01:05.880> part<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> dioxide<00:01:07.110> from

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
actually taking part and dioxide from

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.650 
actually taking part and dioxide from
the<00:01:07.410> tank<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.070> blowing<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> through<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.300> hole

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
the tank it blowing it through this hole

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.870 
the tank it blowing it through this hole
and<00:01:10.020> spreading<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> over<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.190> plants<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.760> each

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and spreading it over the plants in each

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.810 
and spreading it over the plants in each
stone<00:01:12.380> while<00:01:13.380> Lu<00:01:13.650> connects<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> carbon

stone while Lu connects up the carbon

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.390 
stone while Lu connects up the carbon
dioxide<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.720> show<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.290> how<00:01:16.590> heavy<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.860 

these<00:01:20.400> balloons<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.090> filled<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.570> gas

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
these balloons are filled with a gas

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.680 
these balloons are filled with a gas
called<00:01:22.290> helium<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.340> much<00:01:24.180> lighter<00:01:24.630> than<00:01:25.020> air

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
called helium it's much lighter than air

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.450 
called helium it's much lighter than air
but<00:01:27.690> these<00:01:27.870> balloons<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.650> full<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> carbon

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
but these balloons are full of carbon

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
but these balloons are full of carbon
dioxide<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> heavy

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
dioxide which as you can see is a heavy

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
dioxide which as you can see is a heavy
gas<00:01:32.310> much<00:01:32.820> heavier<00:01:33.240> than<00:01:33.300> air<00:01:36.050> carbon<00:01:37.050> dioxide

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
gas much heavier than air carbon dioxide

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310 
gas much heavier than air carbon dioxide
weighs<00:01:38.040> tons<00:01:38.550> no<00:01:39.420> wonder<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.810> makes<00:01:40.020> plants

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
weighs tons no wonder it makes plants

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.570 
weighs tons no wonder it makes plants
heavier<00:01:41.840> remember<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> equation<00:01:43.530> for

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
heavier remember the equation for

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.550 
heavier remember the equation for
photosynthesis<00:01:44.580> well<00:01:45.510> if<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.990> increase<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
photosynthesis well if you increase the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.650 
photosynthesis well if you increase the
raw<00:01:46.710> materials<00:01:47.400> you<00:01:47.880> would<00:01:47.970> expect<00:01:48.360> more

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
raw materials you would expect more

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.480 
raw materials you would expect more
photosynthesis<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.710> take<00:01:49.920> place<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.270> does<00:01:51.570> it

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
photosynthesis to take place but does it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.760 
photosynthesis to take place but does it
this<00:01:53.490> apparatus<00:01:53.910> can<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.960> measure<00:01:55.200> how

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this apparatus can actually measure how

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950 
this apparatus can actually measure how

increase<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.900> carbon<00:02:24.260> dioxide<00:02:24.800> supply<00:02:25.220> to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
increase the carbon dioxide supply to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.450 
increase the carbon dioxide supply to
the<00:02:25.550> leaf<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.690> rate<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.100> photosynthesis<00:02:28.100> goes

the leaf the rate of photosynthesis goes

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.240 
the leaf the rate of photosynthesis goes
up<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.390> does<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.750> mean<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> plants<00:02:30.590> grow<00:02:30.680> more

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
up but does it mean the plants grow more

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.620 
up but does it mean the plants grow more

growth<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.630> what's<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.020> point<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.350> this

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
growth so what's the point of this

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.980 
growth so what's the point of this
experiment<00:03:27.890> what<00:03:28.190> does<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.430> tell<00:03:28.580> us<00:03:28.780> well<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
experiment what does it tell us well the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.570 
experiment what does it tell us well the
thing<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.170> scientists<00:03:30.830> know<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.040> carbon

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
thing is scientists know that carbon

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.450 
thing is scientists know that carbon
dioxide<00:03:32.180> has<00:03:32.480> increased<00:03:33.020> in<00:03:33.230> year<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.770> it's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
dioxide has increased in year and it's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.130 
dioxide has increased in year and it's
going<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.700> continue<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.270> increase<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:36.080> the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
going to continue to increase in the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.410 
going to continue to increase in the
future<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.370> work<00:03:37.490> we're<00:03:37.730> doing<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:38.000> we

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
future so the work we're doing here we

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.390 
future so the work we're doing here we
used<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.750> try<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:38.960> understand<00:03:39.560> how<00:03:40.190> that's

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
used to try and understand how that's

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.730 
used to try and understand how that's
going<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.700> affect<00:03:40.760> plant<00:03:41.300> growth<00:03:41.660> listen<00:03:42.620> why

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
going to affect plant growth listen why

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.960 
going to affect plant growth listen why
don't<00:03:42.770> we<00:03:43.010> check<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.430> results<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.880> a

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
don't we check on the results of a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.180 
don't we check on the results of a
little<00:03:44.210> experiment<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.170> uses<00:03:45.500> an<00:03:45.800> ice<00:03:45.950> dome

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
little experiment it uses an ice dome

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.840 
little experiment it uses an ice dome
and<00:03:46.340> I'll<00:03:46.460> go<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.760> see<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.060> ones<00:03:47.240> in<00:03:47.450> here<00:03:48.850> six

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850
