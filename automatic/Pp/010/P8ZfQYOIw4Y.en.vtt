00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
cones or anything like that cuz this is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.609 
cones or anything like that cuz this is
the<00:01:32.509> time<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:32.780> your<00:01:33.050> hair<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.410> most

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
the time that your hair is most

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.499 
the time that your hair is most
definitely<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.070> most<00:01:34.190> tangle<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.850> especially

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
definitely the most tangle is especially

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
twists as well as the hair being dry so

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.160 
twists as well as the hair being dry so
you<00:01:40.040> should<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.399> using<00:01:40.640> no<00:01:40.940> combs<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.960> take

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170

you should be using no combs to take
these<00:01:42.350> down<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.399> again<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:43.850> said<00:01:43.910> if<00:01:44.180> I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
sections natural hair once water in it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.390 
sections natural hair once water in it
is<00:03:45.300> shrivel<00:03:45.720> up<00:03:45.810> really<00:03:46.440> small<00:03:46.590> minds<00:03:47.160> so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
is shrivel up really small minds so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.820 
is shrivel up really small minds so
what's<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:47.820> small<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> sponge<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.590> this

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
what's so small like a sponge so this
