00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.430
 good in the first tutorial the first 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.220
 video we saw how we could get what 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.590
 maxwell charges worth 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.590
 remind you that either through the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.070
 Maxwell palettes plugin or in image 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 maxwell maxwell creative plugin we can 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 take out the palette 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 if we wanted to make a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.660
 render the first thing we have to do 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.680
 with whatever we were 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.680
 drawn vouchers 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.350
 if we go to the generic perspective 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.370
 it should be here right now and we could 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.380
 it fails to launch 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.830
 the interactive visualization of maxwell 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.870
 as you see we would have a 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.870
 preview of our render 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.130
 and from there, let's say we would see here 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 how will it stay if we want 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.080
 launch in a render directly because 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.000
 we would have to give him or her until the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.220
 render or right here to the camera 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 that we can also take out in projection 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.070
 Photo render and in document image 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.120
 generative projection photo renÃ© vale 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.120
 if we give you here 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.400
 and jump to the load 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:45.140
 maxwell render you are loading 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.290
 and you start in our our networks and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.710
 here we are seeing how it is going to go 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.710
 will stay 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.229
 and I was starting to load good first 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.170
 what you have to see is that maxwell render 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.409
 We are going to have mainly two forms 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.479
 of d 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.340
 to specify the quality that we 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.679
 we want that through the broad 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.480
 slight rebound levels as well 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.319
 speak the principles not exactly 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.470
 but the quality levels so 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.610
 say it and time is worth every time 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.260
 we launch a render to the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.799
 girl by default 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.799
 and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.330
 has the girls plugin for 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.320
 defect has a time of 900 minutes and 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.080
 a bird sample of 25 is worth that 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 we can control document image 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.820
 Creative define photo rendering 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.640
 OK 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.980
 here in define photo render what yes 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.170
 we have to be clear is that we have 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.110
 that change things or the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.050
 parameters of 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.050
 the rainer engine and other web is worth this 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.080
 it only affects alive work then 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.290
 we change to maxwell render and we have the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.860
 default parameters of maxwell large 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.750
 then as you can see here is the time and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.510
 the quality the level of rebounds so 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.209
 say it 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.850
 900 time are 15 now a lot of 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.650
 weather 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:29.490
 the level of 25 of light samples is 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.880
 also very high a render to get to 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.200
 a level of 25 I'll take a lot 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.050
 even maybe more than 15 hours 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.650
 I the hostages that I have made reaching 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.330
 a wide 18 so has a quality 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.540
 more or less good is not losing grain 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.640
 and time, because it is always interesting to put 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.930
 a much longer time to follow 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.940
 before 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.760
 maxwell render gets for example the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.460
 sample of birds 18 then it will stop there 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.530
 OK 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.030
 in principle these two parameters are 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.310
 which we will control the quality 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.970
 for time mainly because the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.760
 quality goes together with time is worth it here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.690
 we have another option in the in the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.320
 quality where maxwell render lets us 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.450
 catch between the maxwell engine render and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.550
 the engine draft that the same engine 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.400
 failures but that can also be done 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.009
 seen through with the fault engine 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.050
 at the faults counter at the beginning 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.060
 it's very quick for previews 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.900
 to see how it will look is very fast 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.259
 but when when it's going 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.509
 towards higher quality levels the 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.090
 time may even be that although it is 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.930
 of production so I always 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.360
 I leave in production and what 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.210
 the preview with normal failure in 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.120
 current 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.620
 this we say that if we want to launch a 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.330
 render that is the first thing we're going to see 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.060
 well you know 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.620
 good through picture network photo of 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.460
 RenÃ© photo projection if we have it 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.620
 put some photo engines networks 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.100
 well through this square that the 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.350
 that launches in maxwell render or if 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.819
 we want to simply see the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.750
 previewing through failing 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.729
 ok and this second tutorial well here 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.490
 just that is to say very basic simply 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.020
 to know until launching a voucher network 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.319
 thank you 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.319
 suddenly
