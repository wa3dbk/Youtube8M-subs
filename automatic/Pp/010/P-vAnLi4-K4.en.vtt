00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.889
 but vrubel d say thank you for coming in 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:03.689
 our studio 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.110
 group vtb are daughters wine 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.530
 It was created in 2005 and so 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.969
 loudly declared himself nationally 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.679
 Eurovision Competition 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.029
 where did the name come from 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.140
 but it's such a long interest history 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710
 the first two years we did not speak at all well 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.610
 or sat in us rehearsal 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.740
 compose new songs to them 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.340
 tried to somehow develop 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.339
 the program 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.699
 but it was interesting to everyone in principle 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.769
 that we do the same to us we 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.440
 alexis often came our friends 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.740
 and one of these days 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.490
 interest did not listen to us 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.370
 We play and posts offered for this 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.110
 the name is because the communication that they have 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 times created while listening 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150
 they were very similar after 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 reading a book district purchased with 2 draws 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.250
 roach from the north is good in others 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.640
 contests participated 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.030
 selling participating in other contests but 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660
 This percentage of competition is completely different. 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.360
 format, that is, such a format as 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.000
 Eurovision for us it was absolutely 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.050
 new experience of some kind 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.570
 that is, it was a completely new thing 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 because he 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.990
 we are like work 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.070
 slightly different court format more 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.970
 jazz funk so our to the pain of underground 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.700
 music 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.080
 which kind of one element show it 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.290
 missing as such so 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 percentage all the same Eurovision is such 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 Herod format in which 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660
 it's not just what you play is important 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.100
 it’s important how you look like you 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.910
 move what are you dressed like she is yourself 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.220
 hairstyle 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.170
 a and 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.270
 and 0 colors 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.710
 that sort of thing and for us it was absolutely 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.720
 new is absolutely not familiar and very 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.560
 is useful 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.549
 produces a huge walk don't plan 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.010
 you Eurovision 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.939
 a d 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.219
 well as we are always planning 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.939
 remain attacks however in this niche 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.060
 because 2 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 percentage after talking to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.020
 anxious listeners percentage 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.280
 we came to what conclusion that music 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.020
 where we play she 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.530
 not fit no principle 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.490
 format because we have a clean underground 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.750
 back also can not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.939
 but because all the same there therefore 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.239
 such gas motifs funky people can 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.150
 because of this people can listen 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.549
 and his most like us concert such when 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.469
 people come 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.739
 and listen 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.109
 and then they look 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.199
 but then of course I would like to withdraw 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.049
 finally appeared 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.979
 the niche you are doing now 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.539
 start to conquer 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.719
 universe 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.880
 who were satisfied 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.020
 performance in ranked third place 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.809
 yes of course I think very 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.279
 generally happy therefore third place 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.239
 I didn't even expect them to go through this. 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.359
 super final 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.109
 it's because 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.759
 nobody knows us 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.229
 principal to a wider audience we and 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.109
 unknowns such an element is a gift from us 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.789
 there was no her material 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.609
 support and besides, why should we 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.350
 friends helped that is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.530
 all the costumes that we had helped us 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.379
 helped our girlfriend design 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.980
 hairstyle was also helped by our good friend 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.079
 percent 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.989
 for example hero and make up did ours too 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.239
 there is something to think about absolutely yes we have 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.009
 there was no sponsor at all 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.989
 no support at all 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.809
 that is, nothing at all 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.919
 I am all other participants and not supposedly 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.499
 they all have managers there 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.889
 knowledge quite article producer office 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.389
 we have nothing at all therefore 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.059
 we are generally so advanced 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.969
 long away 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.749
 it's a big win for me 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.069
 peasants believe that we occupied there 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.029
 a place not lower than the first one I think that we 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.459
 won 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.459
 no one put the knife team 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.079
 percentage but it seems to me she still 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.879
 judge because now for now 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.269
 Deputy is more that 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.889
 this time they are still going percent of the market 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.019
 so I know what an event is 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:52.839
 but 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:54.939
 Well, I think that honor when it settles can 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.069
 be something but the number of fans on 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.839
 in social networks us increased yes 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.099
 You have such an opinion expressed to the police with 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.339
 his co-workers 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.000
 native riddle for me really 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.060
 that is, fewer people said that 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.060
 henceforth gives these here 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.680
 black real crying so in the second hour 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.470
 the words i am true i am this country this is not 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.320
 heard because 0 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.130
 because I did not hear myself 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.800
 all i hear is records how they rate 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.560
 your voices from the perspective of how it sounds like 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.090
 he can start for someone there like him 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.659
 reminds 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.659
 so I really don't know what the answer is 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.319
 will arrive 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.979
 but that writes songs 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.360
 and we on the contrary the stage chorus he writes about 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.330
 in your pocket 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.349
 or another nomination still owns the lyrics 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.360
 but not necessary 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.490
 Well, so spontaneously loves or hung out 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.490
 investigators mode spring for loved ones 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.349
 Radwanska Kovalchuk 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.539
 or how it happens 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.469
 I basically of course spontaneously because 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.169
 This is such a process that they can not 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.889
 no how the percentage 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.740
 whip up knows if testers 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.129
 storage help 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.809
 something to come up if not here 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:05.980
 nothing came up 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.800
 but how to work, too, is necessary that is, if 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.200
 have some idea toastmaster sit for hours 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.980
 need this idea how its trying to develop but 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.040
 continue to work on the first 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.140
 the very idea of ​​anapa are dusting the whole spartak 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.639
 ryzhov 1100 same do it yourself yes 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.319
 in music it's your only 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.610
 calling job 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.470
 vocation and I would say that I will take 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.470
 this marriage 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.570
 I think that the vocation of the opposition 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.750
 if the ec in response to music from that position 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.760
 what would i like to do my whole 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.200
 life and what brings me less 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.939
 pleasures 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.179
 work no it's not the only job i 

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:43.099
 these works are usually work 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.309
 also 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.209
 Well, well, I wish you good luck 

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.900
 creative 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.930
 of life 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.360
 thanks to all of her victories 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.750
 this month sense of style at 9 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.050
 o'clock in the morning
