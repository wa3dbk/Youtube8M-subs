 so-called performance package for the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.019
 vehicle 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.130
 Let's see what that is 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.249
 I bring and I have 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.779
 got professional help 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:26.399
 one of crispy cakes ssten racing 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.739
 our time is the seat leon 2.0 tsi 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:32.800
 280 as the name suggests slide 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.400
 280 ps powerful and have with the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.000
 Compact spanier relatively easy game 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.040
 for 32,000 230 euros the customer gets 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.770
 amazingly sporty 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.490
 compact car for his money and it works 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.130
 even better 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.960
 who really cares about the Spanish style? 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.600
 want to pack the horns well with the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.040
 additional performance package 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.460
 right with the three-door one 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.690
 LeÃ³n Cupra is equipped so I show 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.970
 Now tell the difference between 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.489
 the normal cooper 280 and cooper 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.439
 218 with performance package finished like this 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.749
 feature is the brake we have here 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.210
 a 4 piston brembo brake system the 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:11.890
 also in motorsport 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.929
 is run the've motorsport 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.130
 technology really on the street then 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.490
 we have the cup of michelin mature 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.929
 which has a very high grip level 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.100
 That means that's also one 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.679
 huge advantage 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.859
 unlike normal street tires 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.399
 cooper 280 then we go further 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.659
 behind 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.130
 here we have the side skirts, so to speak 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.259
 they are visually very beautiful 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.819
 succeeded are the car a 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.880
 pull a bit in the width 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.990
 Seen from the game and when you are here 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.909
 go back a bit 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.709
 we still have nice pages here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.359
 spoiler the simple ones this one 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.549
 rear spoiler a bit more after 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.709
 pull down and thereby the tail acts 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.560
 on a bit more compact and somewhere 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.240
 very sporty 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.799
 how much the package really brings 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.619
 we find it close to a race course 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.049
 barcelona out with us at the start 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.360
 sebastian steel racer and 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.039
 designated touring car specialist 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.289
 He knows exactly how to look 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.720
 powerful production cars the last 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.300
 can tickle out and like 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.730
 first shows as a helpful racer 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.470
 looking at the amateur grumbling 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.840
 He has to acknowledge that he is not here anymore 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.840
 as the previous student can be 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.920
 the pit lane 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.540
 the rss feed after several exceptions 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.629
 You learn the race track very fast 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.459
 from a professional no matter whether teacher and 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.319
 Students sitting together in a car 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.110
 can give direct hints to racers 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.190
 to braking point in the vertex 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.129
 ideal lines or whether the pupil is in 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.090
 her own wife drives to the right 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.920
 come 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.769
 almost meeting the vertex 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.599
 that you do not get caught so easily 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.780
 You have to be careful at the exit because he is 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.080
 will hang relatively here 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.510
 that one because when I vehicle into the grass 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 The next chicane was just one of them 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.450
 Do you talk about them over it braked 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360
 and straight into the heads of the space 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.430
 taken always works better 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.680
 aiming at individual track points 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.510
 where the fleet save steered yes 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 should be around as soon as possible 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.240
 the curves and other passages and 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.280
 get through 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.920
 gradually improve the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.720
 lap the four pistons high 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 Performance brake system of the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.100
 Italian delay professionals Breno 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.150
 league again a noticeable scoop 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.160
 on the akw with 370 mm diameter 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.620
 are the perforated brake discs larger 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.630
 as a family pizza all the more 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.350
 amazing that the extremely high 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.250
 still braking forces can pose 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.900
 Finally, the customer can still 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.090
 decide if he wants the performance package 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.850
 with normal road tires or one 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.709
 sport tires from Michelin order of 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.330
 price plus package increases 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.680
 from 2530 to 3.060 euro as we have seen 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.750
 you can also have a seat leon 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.459
 achieve much with cupra 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.840
 The lap times are really changing 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.620
 and also thanks to the post I got it right 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.620
 what learned
