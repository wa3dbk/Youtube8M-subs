00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
but all around you know if you I would

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.490 
but all around you know if you I would
just<00:02:07.460> not<00:02:07.910> wear<00:02:08.240> these<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.630> rain<00:02:08.840> because

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
just not wear these in the rain because

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
I noticed that the rain water tends to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.780 
I noticed that the rain water tends to
throw<00:02:12.380> them<00:02:12.620> out
