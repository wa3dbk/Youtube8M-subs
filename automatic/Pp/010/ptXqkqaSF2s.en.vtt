00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
cheap I'm going to post the link of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.779 
cheap I'm going to post the link of
where<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.330> got<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.529> see<00:00:22.760> where<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
where I got it so you can see where I

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.660 
where I got it so you can see where I
got<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.090> from<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.080> how<00:00:26.010> cheap<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.430> really

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
got it from and how cheap they really

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.509 
got it from and how cheap they really
are<00:00:27.470> how<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.310> I'm

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
are how I'm going to do this is I'm

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.780 
are how I'm going to do this is I'm
going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.050> wire<00:00:31.130> both<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.430> together

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
going to wire both of these together

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.639 
going to wire both of these together
with<00:00:33.420> two<00:00:33.630> wires<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.020> positive<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.620> negative

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
with two wires a positive and negative

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
with two wires a positive and negative
and<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.610> why<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> positive<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and then why are the positive to the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.119 
and then why are the positive to the
fuse<00:00:36.809> box<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> negative<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> ground

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
fuse box and the negative to a ground

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.170 
fuse box and the negative to a ground
I'm<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:38.969> explaining<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> wiring<00:00:39.899> later<00:00:40.110> on

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'm not explaining the wiring later on

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.580 
I'm not explaining the wiring later on
all<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.360> need<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.410> LEDs

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
all you need to this is the two LEDs

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.850 
all you need to this is the two LEDs
obviously<00:00:44.600> some<00:00:45.600> extra<00:00:45.870> wire<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.649> using

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
obviously some extra wire I'm just using

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.119 
obviously some extra wire I'm just using
wire<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> hanging<00:00:47.760> around<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> house

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.080 

some<00:00:53.449> mounting<00:00:54.449> tape<00:00:54.629> double-stick<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:56.090> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
some mounting tape double-stick and a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560 
some mounting tape double-stick and a
soldering<00:00:57.329> iron<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:59.180> that's<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.449> right

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
soldering iron and that's it for right

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.610 
soldering iron and that's it for right
now<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.199> ahead<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> show

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
now so I'm going to go ahead and show

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
now so I'm going to go ahead and show
you<00:01:01.680> how<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> wire<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.670> right<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:02.969> okay

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you how to wire these up right now okay

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
you how to wire these up right now okay
so<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.229> upside<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.280> getting

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so we are upside here and we're getting

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.570 
so we are upside here and we're getting
rid<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> wires<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.100> what<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> went<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.430> had

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
rid of the wires up so what I went I had

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.480 
rid of the wires up so what I went I had
them<00:01:08.670> data<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:10.500> cut<00:01:10.799> two<00:01:11.250> wires

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
them data actually is I cut two wires

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.219 
them data actually is I cut two wires
one<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> positive<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.140> be

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
one going to be the positive one to be

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
one going to be the positive one to be
the<00:01:13.350> negative<00:01:13.549> now<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> know<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.000> looks<00:01:15.180> really

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the negative now I know it looks really

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.990 
the negative now I know it looks really
long<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.229> hard<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.280> cut

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
long it's kind of hard to see but I cut

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.880 
long it's kind of hard to see but I cut
it<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.240> half<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.869> soldered<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> middle

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it in half and I soldered at the middle

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.340 
it in half and I soldered at the middle
and<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> reason<00:01:20.580> why<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> did<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.030> because

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
and the reason why I did that is because

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
and the reason why I did that is because
that<00:01:22.350> end<00:01:22.650> mayor<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> C's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that end mayor is going to go to the C's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.560 
that end mayor is going to go to the C's
box<00:01:25.250> where<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> soldered<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> go

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
box where it's soldered is going to go

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.109 
box where it's soldered is going to go
to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> left<00:01:28.439> side<00:01:28.680> closest<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> fuse<00:01:29.729> box

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
to the left side closest to the fuse box

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.459 
to the left side closest to the fuse box
the<00:01:31.210> other<00:01:31.359> one<00:01:31.479> running<00:01:31.689> across<00:01:31.929> is<00:01:32.229> going<00:01:32.409> to

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
the other one running across is going to

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.679 
the other one running across is going to
come<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:32.920> side<00:01:33.189> it<00:01:33.460> makes<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.000> easier<00:01:34.390> so

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
come to this side it makes it easier so

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.410 
come to this side it makes it easier so
you<00:01:34.750> only<00:01:34.929> have<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.229> run<00:01:35.850> three<00:01:36.850> wires<00:01:37.060> rather

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
you only have to run three wires rather

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.749 
you only have to run three wires rather
than<00:01:37.570> four<00:01:37.840> B<00:01:38.829> as<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.100> well<00:01:39.219> same<00:01:39.520> thing<00:01:39.670> with

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
than four B as you well same thing with

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.849 
than four B as you well same thing with
the<00:01:39.850> negative<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:41.140> side<00:01:41.380> right<00:01:41.409> there<00:01:41.590> is

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
the negative so that side right there is

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.069 
the negative so that side right there is
going<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.069> go<00:01:42.159> up<00:01:42.219> into<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.490> feed<00:01:42.700> bog<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
going to go up into the feed bog the

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.620 
going to go up into the feed bog the
solder<00:01:44.439> point<00:01:44.829> is<00:01:45.579> going<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.819> connect<00:01:46.179> to<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
solder point is going to connect to the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.169 
solder point is going to connect to the
positive<00:01:46.810> end<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.909> going<00:01:49.090> to

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
positive end of that and that's going to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
so I found a fuse out here she's number

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.880 
so I found a fuse out here she's number
fifteen<00:02:15.879> that's<00:02:16.120> four<00:02:16.420> enough<00:02:17.410> fuse<00:02:17.650> number

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
fifteen that's four enough fuse number

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.350 
fifteen that's four enough fuse number
fifteen<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.549> actually<00:02:18.819> fuse<00:02:19.060> number

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
fifteen to actually fuse number

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.430 
fifteen to actually fuse number
seventeen<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:20.950> fifteen<00:02:21.690> fuse<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.900> that's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
seventeen but to fifteen fuse and that's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.020 
seventeen but to fifteen fuse and that's
actually<00:02:23.620> supposed<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:24.489> an<00:02:24.579> audio<00:02:24.849> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
so I know that that's going to come on

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.880 
so I know that that's going to come on

did<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> wiring<00:03:12.250> I'm<00:03:13.250> grounding<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.030> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
did the wiring I'm grounding it to the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.530 
did the wiring I'm grounding it to the
battery<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.750> then<00:03:15.740> I<00:03:15.770> got<00:03:16.040> two<00:03:16.490> wires<00:03:16.670> coming

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
battery and then I got two wires coming

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.690 
battery and then I got two wires coming
over<00:03:17.780> there<00:03:17.930> getting<00:03:18.680> attached<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.340> so

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
over there getting attached to that so

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
over there getting attached to that so
now<00:03:19.820> we're<00:03:20.060> going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.210> do<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.450> we're<00:03:20.540> going<00:03:20.570> to

now we're going to do is we're going to
push<00:03:21.320> all<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.590> wires<00:03:21.770> up<00:03:22.130> I'm<00:03:22.910> peel<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.360> tape

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
push all the wires up I'm peel the tape

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.250 
push all the wires up I'm peel the tape
mount<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.650> up<00:03:24.740> hide<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.580> wires<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.270> we<00:03:27.080> should

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
mount it up hide the wires and we should

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.910 
mount it up hide the wires and we should
be<00:03:27.350> all<00:03:27.470> good<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.770> go

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
all right all done and mounted that's

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.210 
all right all done and mounted that's
what<00:03:32.030> these<00:03:32.150> bad<00:03:32.420> boys<00:03:32.570> look<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:34.840> so

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.670 

actually<00:03:39.220> pretty<00:03:39.400> brain<00:03:40.409> bridges<00:03:41.409> on<00:03:41.560> my

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
actually pretty brain bridges on my

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.410 
actually pretty brain bridges on my
daytime<00:03:42.040> running<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.269> pretty

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
daytime running like so that's pretty

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.050 
daytime running like so that's pretty

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
the kind of choppy tutorial but I did

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.600 
the kind of choppy tutorial but I did
the<00:03:55.690> best<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.989> could<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.920> picture<00:03:57.310> of

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
the best I could I have a picture of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.290 
the best I could I have a picture of
them<00:03:57.819> with<00:03:58.060> my<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.920> tried<00:03:59.920> these

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.210 

bad<00:04:02.960> did<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.380> feel<00:04:03.560> like<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.770> really<00:04:03.920> didn't

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
bad did I feel like I really didn't

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.240 
bad did I feel like I really didn't
explain<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:06.140> wiring<00:04:06.530> as<00:04:06.620> much<00:04:06.800> as<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.040> probably

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
explain the wiring as much as I probably

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.160 
explain the wiring as much as I probably
should<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.570> don't<00:04:08.630> want<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:08.990> guys<00:04:09.140> to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
should of and I don't want you guys to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.750 
should of and I don't want you guys to
be<00:04:09.380> confused<00:04:09.830> because<00:04:10.100> it's<00:04:10.310> supposed<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.670> be

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
be confused because it's supposed to be

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.520 
be confused because it's supposed to be
a<00:04:10.790> do-it-yourself<00:04:11.660> not<00:04:11.960> a<00:04:11.990> figure<00:04:12.410> out

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
a do-it-yourself not a figure out

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.190 
a do-it-yourself not a figure out
yourself<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.600> I'm<00:04:14.600> going<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.780> quickly<00:04:15.020> explain

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
yourself so I'm going to quickly explain

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.830 
yourself so I'm going to quickly explain
the<00:04:15.650> wiring<00:04:16.070> I'm<00:04:17.060> not<00:04:17.269> very<00:04:17.390> good<00:04:17.480> at<00:04:17.660> drawing

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
the wiring I'm not very good at drawing

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.910 
the wiring I'm not very good at drawing
so<00:04:18.470> kind<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.070> bear<00:04:19.250> with<00:04:19.430> me<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:21.110> how

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
so kind of bear with me so this is how

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.230 
so kind of bear with me so this is how
we<00:04:21.980> wired<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.400> up<00:04:22.580> can<00:04:23.360> we<00:04:23.420> have<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.260> LEDs<00:04:25.240> on

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
we wired it up can we have the LEDs on

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.870 
we wired it up can we have the LEDs on
there<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.870> then<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.950> meant<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.640> right

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
there and then this is meant this right

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.460 
there and then this is meant this right
here<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.210> went<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.540> be<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.960> bumper<00:04:30.290> so

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
here it went to be like the bumper so

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.960 
here it went to be like the bumper so
you<00:04:30.560> get<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.770> one<00:04:30.920> on<00:04:30.950> one<00:04:31.220> side<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.850> one

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
you get the one on one side and the one

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.180 
you get the one on one side and the one
on<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.210> other<00:04:32.300> i<00:04:32.740> mounted<00:04:33.740> those<00:04:33.920> with

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
on the other i mounted those with

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.760 
on the other i mounted those with
mounting<00:04:34.670> tape<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.320> just<00:04:36.320> brought<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.560> from<00:04:36.620> a

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
mounting tape I just brought it from a

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.230 
mounting tape I just brought it from a
hardware<00:04:37.040> store<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.640> seems<00:04:37.880> two<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.120> them

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
hardware store it seems two of them

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.820 
hardware store it seems two of them
sticking<00:04:38.510> grade<00:04:38.810> this<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:39.110> about<00:04:39.260> five<00:04:39.530> days

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
sticking grade this is about five days

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.890 
sticking grade this is about five days
later<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.490> seems<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.210> be<00:04:41.300> sticking<00:04:41.570> really

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
later it seems to be sticking really

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.360 
later it seems to be sticking really
good<00:04:42.050> haven't<00:04:42.470> had<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> problem<00:04:42.950> with<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.220> at

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
good haven't had a problem with it at

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.840 
good haven't had a problem with it at
all

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
all

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.050 
all
just<00:04:44.630> on<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.840> LEDs<00:04:45.230> you<00:04:45.860> have<00:04:46.010> positive<00:04:46.820> and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
just on the LEDs you have positive and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.780 
just on the LEDs you have positive and
negative<00:04:47.120> wires<00:04:48.080> coming<00:04:48.530> out<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.980> on<00:04:49.220> both

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
negative wires coming out of it on both

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.680 
negative wires coming out of it on both
LEDs<00:04:50.270> now<00:04:51.050> what<00:04:51.170> I<00:04:51.200> did<00:04:51.440> for<00:04:52.250> my<00:04:52.310> Civic<00:04:52.820> is<00:04:53.060> I've

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
LEDs now what I did for my Civic is I've

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.110 
LEDs now what I did for my Civic is I've
mounted<00:04:53.900> them<00:04:54.260> and<00:04:54.500> there's<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.770> little<00:04:54.950> hole

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
mounted them and there's a little hole

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.160 
mounted them and there's a little hole
because<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.180> don't<00:04:56.360> have<00:04:56.420> fog<00:04:56.750> lights<00:04:56.780> on<00:04:57.110> my

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
because I don't have fog lights on my

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.100 
because I don't have fog lights on my
car<00:04:57.350> there's<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.620> little<00:04:58.510> plastic<00:04:59.510> thing<00:04:59.750> where

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
car there's a little plastic thing where

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.720 
car there's a little plastic thing where
you<00:05:00.500> punch<00:05:00.770> out<00:05:00.950> if<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.190> want<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.340> put<00:05:01.520> fog

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
you punch out if you want to put fog

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.280 
you punch out if you want to put fog
lights<00:05:01.940> in<00:05:02.090> but<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.240> left<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:02.660> in<00:05:02.750> there<00:05:02.930> and

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
lights in but I left that in there and

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.480 
lights in but I left that in there and
there's<00:05:03.560> actually<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:03.920> little<00:05:04.130> hole<00:05:04.310> in<00:05:04.400> the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
there's actually a little hole in the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.620 
there's actually a little hole in the
corner<00:05:04.730> where<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.000> can<00:05:05.180> run<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.450> lights

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
corner where I can run the lights

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.090 
corner where I can run the lights
through<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.440> what<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:06.620> did<00:05:06.710> is<00:05:06.919> I<00:05:07.010> took<00:05:07.210> one<00:05:08.210> wire

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
through so what I did is I took one wire

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.770 
through so what I did is I took one wire
one<00:05:10.100> really<00:05:10.430> really<00:05:10.640> long<00:05:10.850> wire<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.419> I

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
one really really long wire and I

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.810 
one really really long wire and I
connected<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.290> to<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.560> fuse<00:05:12.950> box<00:05:12.980> now<00:05:13.490> for<00:05:13.700> my

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
connected it to the fuse box now for my

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.110 
connected it to the fuse box now for my
fuse<00:05:14.240> there<00:05:14.660> was<00:05:14.780> one<00:05:14.990> 7a<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:16.820> actually

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
fuse there was one 7a that actually

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.270 
fuse there was one 7a that actually
turns<00:05:17.390> off<00:05:17.570> with<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.900> ignition<00:05:18.350> and<00:05:18.650> turns<00:05:19.040> on

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
turns off with the ignition and turns on

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.610 
turns off with the ignition and turns on
so<00:05:20.180> that's<00:05:20.330> what<00:05:20.480> I<00:05:20.510> wanted<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:20.960> wanted<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.470> be

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
so that's what I wanted I wanted to be

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.350 
so that's what I wanted I wanted to be
on<00:05:21.800> I<00:05:21.830> didn't<00:05:22.220> want<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.460> have<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:22.760> wire<00:05:22.940> switch

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
on I didn't want to have to wire switch

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.760 
on I didn't want to have to wire switch
into<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.720> so<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:23.900> wired<00:05:24.140> it<00:05:24.320> right<00:05:24.470> into<00:05:24.590> the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
into it so I wired it right into the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.630 
into it so I wired it right into the
fuse<00:05:25.010> box<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.490> then<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.870> ran<00:05:27.200> down<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.860> then<00:05:28.550> I

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
fuse box and then it ran down and then I

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.340 
fuse box and then it ran down and then I
kind<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.970> stripped<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.510> little<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.870> wire<00:05:30.050> off

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
kind of stripped a little the wire off

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.670 
kind of stripped a little the wire off
into<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.250> positive<00:05:31.490> wire<00:05:31.910> from<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.270> LED

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
into the positive wire from the LED

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.470 
into the positive wire from the LED
attached<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.919> to<00:05:33.950> that<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.460> then<00:05:34.669> ran<00:05:35.000> up<00:05:35.180> same

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
attached it to that and then ran up same

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.800 
attached it to that and then ran up same
wire<00:05:35.750> all<00:05:36.140> the<00:05:36.200> way<00:05:36.919> across<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.730> bumper<00:05:38.150> kind

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
wire all the way across the bumper kind

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.060 
wire all the way across the bumper kind
of<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.960> bottom<00:05:39.260> of<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.410> bumper<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.740> get<00:05:39.950> to

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
of the bottom of the bumper to get to

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.030 
of the bottom of the bumper to get to
this<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:41.150> other<00:05:41.330> LED<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.530> hooked<00:05:42.740> up<00:05:42.860> to

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
this the other LED and I hooked up to

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.850 
this the other LED and I hooked up to
the<00:05:43.130> positive<00:05:43.280> a<00:05:43.700> man<00:05:44.060> led<00:05:44.620> now<00:05:45.620> for<00:05:45.800> the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
the positive a man led now for the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.950 
the positive a man led now for the
negative<00:05:46.250> kind<00:05:47.060> of<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.210> same<00:05:47.390> thing<00:05:47.600> I<00:05:47.750> took<00:05:47.930> a

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
negative kind of the same thing I took a

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.330 
negative kind of the same thing I took a
really<00:05:48.140> long<00:05:48.260> wire<00:05:48.560> attached<00:05:48.980> it<00:05:49.130> to<00:05:49.160> the

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
really long wire attached it to the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.570 
really long wire attached it to the
negative<00:05:49.700> end<00:05:49.850> of<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.030> battery<00:05:50.240> in<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:51.290> car

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
negative end of the battery in the car

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.980 
negative end of the battery in the car
brought<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.730> down<00:05:52.880> to<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.270> first<00:05:53.540> LED

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
brought it down to the first LED

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.720 
brought it down to the first LED
stripped<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.530> little<00:05:54.740> off<00:05:54.919> hooked<00:05:55.490> it<00:05:55.610> up<00:05:55.669> to

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
stripped a little off hooked it up to

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.600 
stripped a little off hooked it up to
the<00:05:55.880> negative<00:05:56.390> and<00:05:56.720> then<00:05:57.530> put<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:58.010> across<00:05:58.130> the

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
the negative and then put it across the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.470 
the negative and then put it across the
bumper<00:05:59.000> all<00:05:59.330> the<00:06:00.290> way<00:06:00.410> to<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:00.710> next<00:06:01.010> LED
