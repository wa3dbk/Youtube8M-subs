00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
was developed from before we had grow

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.960 
was developed from before we had grow
bags<00:00:32.260> and<00:00:32.470> you<00:00:33.070> put<00:00:33.340> them<00:00:33.400> in<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.610> ground<00:00:33.730> you

I<00:00:41.290> don't<00:00:41.800> know<00:00:41.860> if<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:41.980> can<00:00:42.040> see<00:00:42.220> this<00:00:42.399> on<00:00:42.640> here

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I don't know if you can see this on here

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.920 
I don't know if you can see this on here
the<00:00:44.950> bottom<00:00:45.130> of<00:00:45.340> all<00:00:45.489> tomato<00:00:45.880> plants<00:00:46.300> have<00:00:46.780> got

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
the bottom of all tomato plants have got

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.319 
the bottom of all tomato plants have got
little<00:00:47.170> hairs<00:00:47.410> on<00:00:47.590> them<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.579> those<00:00:48.790> hairs<00:00:49.090> are

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
little hairs on them and those hairs are

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.750 
little hairs on them and those hairs are
their<00:00:49.600> tip<00:00:50.230> for<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.530> plant<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:51.040> detect<00:00:51.489> what's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
their tip for the plant to detect what's

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.760 
their tip for the plant to detect what's
going<00:00:52.090> on<00:00:52.239> in<00:00:52.630> its<00:00:52.899> environment<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.530> if<00:00:53.649> you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
going on in its environment and if you

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.770 
going on in its environment and if you
keep<00:00:53.980> wetting<00:00:54.309> them<00:00:54.730> it's<00:00:55.329> going<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.660> grow

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
keep wetting them it's going to grow

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.959 
keep wetting them it's going to grow
differently<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:56.530> also<00:00:56.680> gets<00:00:57.010> rotted<00:00:57.460> easily

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
differently it also gets rotted easily

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.389 
differently it also gets rotted easily
so<00:00:58.450> so<00:00:58.930> if<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.230> can<00:00:59.350> stop<00:00:59.649> watering<00:01:00.070> where<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
so so if you can stop watering where the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.190 
so so if you can stop watering where the
bottom<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:00.790> plant<00:01:01.030> is<00:01:01.180> then<00:01:01.750> that's<00:01:01.960> fine

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
bottom of the plant is then that's fine

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.920 
bottom of the plant is then that's fine
that's<00:01:02.920> why<00:01:03.219> in<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.910> 70s<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.449> 80s<00:01:04.540> when<00:01:04.869> we

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
that's why in the 70s and 80s when we

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.160 
that's why in the 70s and 80s when we
first<00:01:05.229> got<00:01:05.820> grow<00:01:06.820> bags<00:01:07.060> people<00:01:07.660> used<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.960> put<00:01:08.110> a

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
first got grow bags people used to put a

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.080 
first got grow bags people used to put a
part<00:01:08.440> into<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.100> grow<00:01:09.280> bag<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.610> just<00:01:09.759> water<00:01:09.970> it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
part into the grow bag and just water it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.710 
part into the grow bag and just water it
into<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.390> well<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.229> time<00:01:11.590> we've<00:01:12.340> got<00:01:12.550> these

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
into that well this time we've got these

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840 
into that well this time we've got these
grow<00:01:13.720> pots<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.320> they're<00:01:14.860> basically<00:01:15.100> modified

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
grow pots and they're basically modified

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
grow pots and they're basically modified
ring<00:01:16.540> culture<00:01:17.049> pots

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
ring culture pots

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.310 
ring culture pots
you've<00:01:18.670> got<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.909> pot<00:01:19.150> in<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.299> middle<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:20.140> on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
you've got the pot in the middle and on

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.399 
you've got the pot in the middle and on
the<00:01:20.440> outside<00:01:20.830> I<00:01:21.190> placed<00:01:21.909> two<00:01:22.060> water<00:01:22.390> so<00:01:23.229> that

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
the outside I placed two water so that

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.980 
the outside I placed two water so that
the<00:01:23.560> bottom<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.369> tomato<00:01:24.670> plant<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:25.630> never

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
the bottom of the tomato plant is never

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.380 
the bottom of the tomato plant is never
really<00:01:26.369> wetted<00:01:27.369> through<00:01:27.729> when<00:01:28.210> you're

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
really wetted through when you're

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.539 
really wetted through when you're
watering<00:01:28.869> your<00:01:28.930> Tomatoes<00:01:29.470> also<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.340> water

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
watering your Tomatoes also the water

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.480 
watering your Tomatoes also the water
goes<00:01:30.850> from<00:01:31.540> there<00:01:31.750> into<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.500> bag<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.220> those

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
goes from there into the bag and those

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.960 
goes from there into the bag and those
forces<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> tomato<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:35.500> bring<00:01:35.740> roots<00:01:36.040> out<00:01:36.640> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
forces the tomato to bring roots out of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.450 
forces the tomato to bring roots out of
the<00:01:37.060> bottom<00:01:37.390> into<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.200> grow<00:01:38.350> bag<00:01:38.530> let's<00:01:39.280> put

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
the bottom into the grow bag let's put

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.700 
the bottom into the grow bag let's put
one<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.700> position<00:01:39.909> first<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.689> all<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:41.380> have<00:01:41.560> to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
one in position first of all we have to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.820 
one in position first of all we have to
cut<00:01:41.950> out<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.970> bottom<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.600> top<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.680> go

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
cut out the bottom of the top of the go

cut out the bottom of the top of the go
bag

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.840 

and<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> being<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> case<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:56.070> give

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and that being the case will give

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.380 
and that being the case will give
there's<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.329> crunch<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:59.210> and<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> can

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
there's a bit of a crunch up and you can

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.570 
there's a bit of a crunch up and you can
see<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:00.689> spikes<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.799> got<00:02:01.979> holding<00:02:02.399> that's

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
see these spikes they got holding that's

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.850 
see these spikes they got holding that's
where<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> water<00:02:03.060> goes<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.470> I'm<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> put

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
where the water goes so I'm going to put

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.370 
where the water goes so I'm going to put
this<00:02:05.040> into<00:02:05.549> position<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:06.840> back<00:02:07.049> just

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
this into position in the go back just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.589 
this into position in the go back just
by<00:02:07.560> pushing<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.069> down<00:02:11.030> make<00:02:12.030> sure<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.239> firm

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
by pushing it down make sure it's firm

leaf<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.660> main<00:04:35.900> stem<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.610> called<00:04:37.940> an

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
leaf and the main stem this is called an

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.280 
leaf and the main stem this is called an
axle<00:04:39.610> that's<00:04:40.610> where<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.910> side<00:04:41.120> shoe<00:04:41.360> grows<00:04:41.660> so

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
axle that's where the side shoe grows so

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.380 
axle that's where the side shoe grows so
look<00:04:42.500> where<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> leaves<00:04:43.040> are<00:04:43.370> between<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
look where the leaves are between the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.360 
look where the leaves are between the
leaf<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.810> main<00:04:44.990> stem<00:04:45.320> you'll<00:04:45.890> get<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.100> side

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
leaf and the main stem you'll get a side

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.409 
leaf and the main stem you'll get a side
shoot<00:04:46.640> just<00:04:47.330> snip<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.080> out<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:49.880> just<00:04:49.940> goes<00:04:50.270> to

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
shoot just snip it out it just goes to

anyway this now has outgrown his cane we

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.340 
anyway this now has outgrown his cane we
need<00:05:13.730> to<00:05:13.820> put<00:05:13.940> some<00:05:14.090> new<00:05:14.300> canes<00:05:14.600> in<00:05:14.840> here<00:05:15.140> and

need to put some new canes in here and

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.200 
need to put some new canes in here and
next<00:05:15.800> time<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.070> look<00:05:16.250> at<00:05:16.370> these<00:05:16.550> there'll<00:05:17.180> be

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
next time you look at these there'll be

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.080 
next time you look at these there'll be
a<00:05:17.300> lot<00:05:17.510> of<00:05:17.540> thinner<00:05:17.840> because<00:05:18.740> when<00:05:19.250> we've<00:05:19.430> set

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
a lot of thinner because when we've set

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.810 
a lot of thinner because when we've set
the<00:05:20.630> tomato<00:05:21.020> trusses<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.620> we<00:05:21.860> want<00:05:22.130> we're

the tomato trusses that we want we're
then<00:05:23.030> going<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.390> remove<00:05:24.010> most<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.250> these

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
then going to remove most of these

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.490 
then going to remove most of these
leaves<00:05:25.760> because<00:05:26.690> once<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:27.020> tomatoes<00:05:27.140> have

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
leaves because once the tomatoes have

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.600 
leaves because once the tomatoes have
set<00:05:27.950> we<00:05:28.550> don't<00:05:28.760> need<00:05:29.030> any<00:05:29.360> more<00:05:30.400> Tomatoes<00:05:31.400> so

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
set we don't need any more Tomatoes so

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.909 
set we don't need any more Tomatoes so
we'll<00:05:31.730> take<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.030> top<00:05:32.270> off<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:33.380> also<00:05:33.530> don't

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
we'll take the top off and we also don't

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.150 
we'll take the top off and we also don't
need<00:05:34.040> any<00:05:34.340> more<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.850> these<00:05:35.600> leaves<00:05:36.160> because

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
need any more of these leaves because

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.790 
need any more of these leaves because
later<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.730> summer<00:05:37.880> into<00:05:38.330> July<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.800> early

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
later in the summer into July and early

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.490 
later in the summer into July and early
August<00:05:40.360> that's<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.540> time<00:05:41.780> when<00:05:41.960> Tomatoes

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
August that's the time when Tomatoes

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.530 
August that's the time when Tomatoes
have<00:05:42.890> problems<00:05:43.280> with<00:05:43.400> blight<00:05:43.700> and<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.030> way

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
have problems with blight and the way

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.690 
have problems with blight and the way
that<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:44.870> help<00:05:45.110> them<00:05:45.710> not<00:05:46.070> have<00:05:46.340> problems

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
that you help them not have problems

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.420 
that you help them not have problems
with<00:05:46.850> blight<00:05:47.090> is<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.810> reduce<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.590> leaf<00:05:48.830> area

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
with blight is to reduce the leaf area

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.960 
with blight is to reduce the leaf area
so<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.270> air<00:05:50.600> can<00:05:50.800> maneuver<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.950> around<00:05:52.160> the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
so that air can maneuver it around the

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.640 
so that air can maneuver it around the
inside<00:05:53.300> of<00:05:53.510> this<00:05:53.690> and

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
inside of this and

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.240 
inside of this and
you<00:05:55.460> will<00:05:55.580> have<00:05:55.790> bold<00:05:56.750> looking<00:05:57.290> but<00:05:57.680> perfect

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
you will have bold looking but perfect

bright yellow some of them are creamy
and<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:13.190> reason<00:06:13.520> why<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.669> cream<00:06:13.940> it<00:06:14.060> is

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
and the reason why the cream it is

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.770 
and the reason why the cream it is
because<00:06:14.479> they've<00:06:14.660> been<00:06:14.750> pollinated<00:06:15.430> when<00:06:16.430> the

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
flowers are pollinated the fruits grow

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.090 
flowers are pollinated the fruits grow
behind<00:06:19.880> them<00:06:20.259> when<00:06:21.259> the<00:06:21.410> fruits<00:06:21.620> start<00:06:21.919> to

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
behind them when the fruits start to

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.730 
behind them when the fruits start to
grow<00:06:22.280> that<00:06:22.759> is<00:06:23.000> what<00:06:23.210> we<00:06:23.419> call<00:06:23.740> setting
