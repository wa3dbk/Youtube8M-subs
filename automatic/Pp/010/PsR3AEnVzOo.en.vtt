00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.230
 I'm going to show you today how you a 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.400
 nice 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.209
 frog can craft from papier-mâché 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.209
 for your pencil 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 I will now show you how 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.110
 we papier-maché glue and papier-maché 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.310
 make to start then you make paper 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.680
 maché line 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.320
 i have i have treat 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.470
 purchased wallpaper glue from the praxis and the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.110
 is treating a powder and I have it 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.170
 in the jar supplemented with water and then 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 well stir well and that works for me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.380
 very nice me also once in two or three 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 years I buy a box just enough 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.170
 fish so big and box of wallpaper glue 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 powder and well so I do 2 or 3 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.610
 last year so I like that 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.890
 cheap and it works very much for me 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.960
 good to make my on the pass you grab 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 a very small glass I have it now 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 filled with water because my glue is what 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.259
 fatter when I meet my glue 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.690
 then make it just nice and thin 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.229
 equally good to use but if I use it 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.340
 a few days let alone you see the one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.740
 little see 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.510
 then it becomes very thick and so I have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.460
 don't feel like having an extra every time 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.170
 I do add water and stir 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 if it is almost empty I will make it 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 that little bit back with water 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.689
 so then I grab a small yes a small one 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.729
 glass with water and then I go 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.159
 my own line for me and also 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.020
 match making is more convenient if I do 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.020
 grabbed a spoon but that's how it works 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.260
 then 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.819
 box toilet paper and you go your toilet paper 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:32.440
 tear into very small pieces and that 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:34.120
 throw in your line like that 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.360
 push down that you get nice and wet 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360
 is becoming 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:06.220
 so and that good push down and 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.989
 keep stirring all the time 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.209
 and for the toilet paper 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.069
 then becomes so wet and when you go 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.489
 it stirs up well and stirs 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.450
 then length it very well with with with it 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.980
 glue in the jar in my glass this is 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.689
 what I am going to do all the time now is me 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 just stop the camera I'm going 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.670
 always tear toilet paper into the jar 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.799
 and stir well and when you're done 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.060
 then i will now come back to the camera 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.560
 and then I show you how I am 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.659
 make octupus 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.139
 my glue is ready as my papier maché 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:49.849
 is ready and then I will show you now 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:51.170
 how you make a frog you start 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.780
 first with a ball it seems 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.049
 actually just flattering but then 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.560
 with yes a bit wet 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.329
 pub group like your like you on paper 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.069
 maché is too wet you grab another one 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.900
 little toilet paper that you add and 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.239
 knead again and then it becomes 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.930
 it naturally a bit firmer 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.989
 well you press it around your pencil 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.840
 look to loosen again then fit you 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.880
 pencil the later nice and so you have 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.900
 a ball for the head and then 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.900
 two eyes 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.750
 them on top 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.750
 but they are a little too big 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.640
 on top and then eliminate the seams 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.900
 I do with my nails because they are long 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.940
 to be 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.580
 If you don't have long nails, have a look 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.750
 what you can use around you in your home 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.830
 a stick and not a sharp knife 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.830
 but you don't broach it 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.490
 so then it becomes a beautiful whole again 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.490
 well that is already one and then another 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.720
 now another edge work away 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.129
 so beautiful with it 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:52.709
 so put this picture in a jar and then 

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:55.529
 at the heating or at the window so that 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:59.989
 it can dry and if that tomorrow or 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:04.019
 the day after tomorrow is dry I grab my 

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:06.439
 first there then you will paint it 

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:09.689
 I have the mouth I signed with 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:12.329
 permanent marker and the eyes I have eh 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:15.929
 on stuck with strong glue what the one 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:17.699
 very small tube with strong glue well that 

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:19.409
 then put it on your eyes and stick it on 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.029
 on 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.889

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.469

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.089
