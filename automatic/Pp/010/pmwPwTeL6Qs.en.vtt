00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 We do not see all friends and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.270
 a small opinion video that I wanted 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.970
 express by means of a video since 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 Well, I've been saying it a thousand times 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.889
 twitter but not everyone follows me or 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.859
 not everyone who follows this channel 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 is there is not my opinion that reflects a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.710
 ot thinking is not a thing with the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.439
 that you can disagree directly 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.210
 but I specifically for the time 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.279
 I'm here because it seems like a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 bullshit, not because I've been watching 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.970
 this page a bit from the start 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.769
 since the Spanish city began 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 since people started even more 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.700
 try to enter and well I was encouraged 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 before others and others in big ones 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 that they nothing to see then with the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 quality that many people are demonstrating 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.739
 and it takes less than a year or with 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 locality of people who will be here years 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.030
 I can not influence perfectly in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 this case because I never knew if he has 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 had quality what has been bullshit 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.860
 I'll play that for you since several 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.860
 years 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.420
 I'm going to talk about that topic today 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.160
 I miss that a lot of people have and do not 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.340
 wants to express that having the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.090
 exclusivity over a content have the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.180
 let's have the news to have the being 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.680
 pioneer is not that kind of scary 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.780
 that has many people that if a 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.640
 video someone can tell you then that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.460
 video has not already uploaded another person hours 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 one minute friends or they saw me or what 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.490
 I have not been seeing for example I put you 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.810
 an example before talking about this to see 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.179
 imagine that you want to make a 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 analysis of against three of super 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.440
 nintendo that an example appears and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.060
 it turns out that that same week or the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.590
 next week before you release it 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.880
 before preparing them then bayless a 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.429
 great good of you 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.159
 or a follower of yours or someone you 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.039
 following that you think it does 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.659
 well that does not deprive you to climb that 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.340
 same video but we have planned 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.229
 some weeks you do not have to wait 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.119
 to another month you do not have to wait for 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.060
 another year and you do not have to cancel it 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.979
 but I've seen attitudes of people who 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.550
 because x staff has already raised a 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.350
 video 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.390
 I should not assume it because to see if 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.190
 see if they are going to tell me 6 in a row and 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.160
 stupid if you're here for patience 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.740
 you're here because you like this, it's going to 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.120
 I sweat very fat to anyone who climbs as I 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.650
 is helping me I do not know if the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.900
 games that I mention has already 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.970
 commented people before I'm sure of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.770
 that if there is I manage a genre that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 I also like the people I follow 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.540
 example 17 no or the action games the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.010
 arcade games and I know I'm 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.300
 following a lot of people by 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.550
 example that they have their own sections 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.410
 arcades and a lot of those people will be 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.090
 matched 15 million times in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.820
 content goes that there will not have been 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 people who have talked about the arcades of 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.350
 cps one helmet of the ccac arcades 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.150
 2 or of you to know that from the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.920
 childhood of the 80s that many people have 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.500
 appeared and therefore there has been 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.510
 similar experiences do not and I do not see 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.030
 that they cut themselves at the time of climbing 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.490
 your msx stuff your things about your 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.770
 things of friends and there are people who are like 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.870
 that what it is that is to share and 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.810
 they do not fix if the neighbor has put 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.879
 the beards 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.250
 to say it somehow then to 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.470
 It pisses me off that we're here 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.090
 in quotes as competing to come 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.980
 go up before you go see who runs the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.599
 exclusive that is a bullshit because 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.610
 within seven years imagine that 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.840
 another web page appears another platform 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.330
 to upload video reviews 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.250
 it's something new because they start to rise there 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.410
 videogame videos that nobody has 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.510
 gone up before there will be people I'm 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.700
 sure he will take advantage of that and people 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.890
 that will be silly and that does not give you the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.940
 wins to upload an analysis because someone 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.430
 He has already done that, it is nonsense 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.750
 because here many of those who are 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.849
 trying a Spanish newspaper and the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.700
 tried in his day were my business videos 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.299
 of the deals your account cousins to 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.069
 see then I find it absurd to create 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.620
 competition where the agency and I said 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.790
 that I upload the videos at my own pace 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.970
 you all know that I have periods that 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.970
 they add less and I'm waiting for 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.040
 the game that I uploaded times that 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.019
 I comment because I say pussy nobody has done 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 a video of this I find interesting 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.430
 I do it but there are times that I have 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.200
 uploaded game analysis that does not go 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.019
 there will be analysis for example to the sky warner 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.569
 board or triple light analysis or 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.549
 analysis at any fps for example from 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.250
 law that from angeli ceo to mirror sets but 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.709
 however the action very fat and I did 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.660
 my common analyzes I considered with 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.960
 techniques with my knowledge and with 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.100
 especially 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.020
 with the experience that I have acquired 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.270
 playing because you know all alexis 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.160
 that is in this channel are made one 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.849
 Once in a while the games or next to 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.860
 go through games that I did not have 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.710
 could pass by there surely 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.630
 legalized that has not been able to run 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.139
 after x I consider myself the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.000
 trained to say no in order the 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.740
 video was just about that if 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.080
 you are new here and new to me 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.000
 new is a person because it does not carry more 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.930
 of two years of aquino one some years 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.940
 that we 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.550
 I caught you off guard that if you have a 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.289
 analysis in the bedroom or 2 500 that we 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.940
 his vice how much is talk about the cock 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.090
 because nobody here has exclusivity 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.250
 about nobody and me less because I 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.320
 better I've uploaded video since 1770 well 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.210
 2009-2010 and now there are people who are 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.710
 Well, it's worth another version 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.240
 updated surely created from the video 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.490
 be better, they can surely contribute 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.770
 actor of the great goalkeeper in his day I smelled his 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.139
 balls because what they are doing is 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.350
 contributing to the noble hobby of 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.639
 video game and a little bit to add more 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.530
 knowledge to our heads or more 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.940
 interest interest in playing we give a 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.039
 interest that I have not created what another 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.320
 person who said the best two people 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.110
 they perform the same game one does not 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.580
 convinces the other as well as we are going to 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.820
 select us from convention back and if 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.770
 you do not give the opportunity to adults 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.720
 so 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.030
 We are a community especially in the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.069
 not very big challenge considered that the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.060
 competition is totally absurd the 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.020
 earn money with the retro theme 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.389
 We know that this channel is not 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.699
 monetizing I have another that if development 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.190
 This is not monetized think 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.069
 how you represent us is a company are 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.009
 the interests of third parties helps you 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:10.080
 compete than say you do it because 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.789
 you never want to make money there are no people 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.129
 that is with the partit however you 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.039
 devotes great passion to this is not that in 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:20.900
 that we no longer tell you what it is 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:24.449
 late is no longer a hallmark of identity that 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.830
 classify who are here by interest 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.810
 to those who do not because there are people that I know 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.389
 that has had to monetize the 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.460
 channels and they are here by passion is not 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.840
 respectable but when those others I have 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.580
 what could be treated in another video 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.710
 but I want to say that yes no 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.479
 represents a company that you are 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.219
 productive do not be, I 'll help you 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.469
 what you have to import is if what you have 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.569
 you like it and if what you have 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:47.249
 can be liked by others in that 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.799
 to be able to improve and in what 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:52.379
 they should improve in any case then nothing 

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:53.879
 more friends a hug and I'll be back 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:57.529
 with another analysis of whatever 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.529
 soon see you soon
