00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.410
 today I tried it with the potatoes that 

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:07.870
 I have in the kitchen we are going to cook and what 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.809
 we are going to do from a land where 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.250
 eat of good good good 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.440
 I was that this weekend I put the 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.280
 boots and I do not say it as Asturian that 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.470
 I am but objectively and in this see me 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.880
 you have to give the reason in asturias like 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.189
 you eat 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 Of course he has been giving the world 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.869
 we are in the land of buen yantar 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.899
 surrounded by mountains of those mountains 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.360
 those good pastures that good milk that 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.699
 baptize all these cheeses and baptize 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.559
 this region like the 43's that that's 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.920
 look here we have for example a 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.440
 of the pear tree also did not tell you the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.300
 famous cabrales and afuega'l pitu that 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.710
 certainly will be the protagonist of 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.829
 our dish today that is this 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.710
 mushroom puppy the possible compound 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.239
 also that milk is the protagonist 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.799
 milk also from our challenge the dessert 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.049
 Asturian par excellence the rice with 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.670
 milk and on the return of the challenge I explain 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.420
 what this plate shows two 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.420
 has the challenge today 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.200
 it does not have an unparalleled good 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.270
 artisanal product is what we demonstrate 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.380
 with our challenges and I love you too 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.720
 talk about something very interesting 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.090
 related to the product the plates 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.710
 km0 here in the jazz devil from the first 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840
 Asturian restaurant they got 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.250
 this plate and here we have beer and that 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.720
 We will explain what this 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.090
 kilometer zero that is a bit like that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.800
 This is the zero kilometer of your basket 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.600
 the purchase 'effectively is the kilometer 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.150
 zero of my shopping cart and to be able to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.370
 be bought those products that I use in 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.560
 100 kilometers in the round so 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.080
 we both give no service here in the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.630
 cook with just healthy food and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.160
 clean for example like these foods 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.960
 that we have here that we are going to start 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.150
 cook this mushroom puppy how to 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.130
 makes see and the mushroom puppy is like 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.050
 a filling and is made with a mushroom in 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.250
 this case we use house that because 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 we are out of season but 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.259
 we would use a clean one we put 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.110
 we love, of course, not 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.619
 missing the afuega'l pitu in this case the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.780
 we will go white flour is 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.970
 very easy to do besides lithium very 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.160
 easy we will go through flour what 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.330
 let's go through egg and today we're going to 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
 Cook 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.720
 but let's cook in the llar that is 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.550
 the old Asturian cuisine that gives 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.520
 name your restaurant to see what 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.530
 beauty 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.370
 tell me the you are already this is the kitchen 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.319
 typical firewood where they were cured 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.330
 the sausages where the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.730
 kitchen eliane elias means the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.530
 room where the family met and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.530
 to warm up also actively 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.720
 Asturian was a very cold area and now 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.160
 not so much the weather very nice and 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.319
 but they were also cooked 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.000
 in that one he left with them and they cooked 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.860
 the women of that time cooked 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.900
 in the pots of the boat had to have 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.420
 strength to be able to climb it to the cove 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.090
 I saw go down what we have already tell me 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.700
 says flags says see and that is not 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.410
 usual cooking on the llar in that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.209
 traditional wood-burning kitchen in which 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.870
 moments usually use them because 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.700
 we work perfectly 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.080
 clear because you 're going to use it if 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.150
 they work very well but good guess 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 that because more certainly slow the 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.110
 cooking is not to people is more practical 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.000
 and what to do therapy would be to be able 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.420
 have to charge a lot of money and that already 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.810
 today the pocket does not allow us if you 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.790
 It seems 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.099
 we have here prepared these 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.379
 cases we are the hook with what happened to 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.379
 a sauce with a sauce that is made with 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.989
 onion that is made with onion like 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.329
 we see here egg next to the cheese 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.640
 afuega'l red pitu and the cream already 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.349

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.140
 want to go here by the llar to 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.450
 because these products taste Asturian 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.970
 here are these chunks finished as 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.530

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.659
