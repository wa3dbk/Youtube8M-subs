time but remember my friend is a cheater

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.359 
time but remember my friend is a cheater
so<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.290> wouldn't<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:07.920> surprising

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
so it really wouldn't be very surprising

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
so it really wouldn't be very surprising
if<00:01:08.640> he<00:01:08.760> used<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> his<00:01:09.330> many<00:01:09.630> methods<00:01:09.990> of

one with the four aces
not<00:01:53.189> him<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> did<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:55.350> give<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> pack

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
not him so what I did was give the pack

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.240

a<00:01:56.100> special<00:01:56.610> magic<00:01:57.240> rub<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.799> my

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a special magic rub and that got me my

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
first ace to get the other three I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
first ace to get the other three I
decided<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> give<00:02:03.719> him<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> taste<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.229> his<00:02:04.380> own

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
decided to give him a taste of his own

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.740 
decided to give him a taste of his own
medicine<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> use<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> his<00:02:06.090> cartooning

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
medicine and use one of his cartooning
techniques<00:02:07.170> against<00:02:07.619> him<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> hid<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
techniques against him so I hid the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.980

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.270 
to set the aces back down but they have
to<00:03:27.360> stay<00:03:27.570> facedown<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.470> way<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:28.770> can't<00:03:29.010> see

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
to stay facedown that way they can't see

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.950 
to stay facedown that way they can't see
the<00:03:29.430> selected<00:03:29.850> card<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:30.510> I'm<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:30.810> to

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
the selected card which I'm about to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.940

show<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> second

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
show you in a second

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.800 
show you in a second
after<00:03:32.550> all<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.940> could<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.420> card<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
after all they could see the card it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.270 
after all they could see the card it
would<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.020> make<00:03:34.140> their<00:03:34.350> job<00:03:34.560> much<00:03:34.830> too<00:03:35.100> easy

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
would just make their job much too easy

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.790 
would just make their job much too easy
and<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.820> course<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.180> don't<00:03:36.270> want<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.440> go

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
and of course we don't want that so go

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.200
