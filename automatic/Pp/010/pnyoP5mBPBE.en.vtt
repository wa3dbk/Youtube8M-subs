00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.880
 glitch from the previous video I showed there 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:31.720
 for you that gave up to 300,000 who 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 played on bs-4 there and here is unfortunately one 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.800
 xbox is the rockstar took off as soon as I 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.320
 I posted the rockstar shot of the xbox so much 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.629
 of the year while 360 they took I did not 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.550
 I was guilty I liked it, I did not know yet 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.710
 I had already posted there after I went to see 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.350
 they had taken away and a lot of people 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.600
 complained that on ps3 also they are some 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.859
 they got some will speak worth it 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.170
 get a lot of people 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.670
 but also many people who did not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.769
 got because the rockstar really 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.559
 is trying to get the ones he got is 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.120
 favorite target a service before the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.550
 rockstar loom is there 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.740
 who has not unfortunately got to have 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.140
 what to expect now then guys now 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.600
 I'm going to post it, do not complain to me if 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.130
 I can not because sometimes I posted 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.470
 after a couple of hours I posted 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.140
 The video of the pop video service can be 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.850
 removed again then face is so 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.710
 bringing this video here for you to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960
 You try another race again but it's 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.149
 the same scheme you go back and forth 10 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.189
 A thousand bets 10,000 on you 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.259
 only the following look here is not 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.700
 it's not so much money against the other 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.790
 here really even give a little 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.500
 money so the version 8 people she 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.649
 could be 30 with aquino preschool 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.530
 network uan could be 30 then it would be 300 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.270
 thousand at the end here with 118 people who is 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.149
 the most that can run in this race 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.560
 here is only 80,000 if you finish 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.869
 then but here a little scheme 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.880
 different or simply you do 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.950
 that scheme there is started the race 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.140
 everybody is stopped and the first one goes there 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.789
 I only hit you have to hit the side there 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.979
 Where the guy is trying to hit 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.229
 just that the guy is getting is a kiss 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.600
 for my mother, just try to read 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.570
 mateus and then does the same sequence and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.820
 finish the race is simply that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.860
 you got there you can win by 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.040
 80 thousand as we are here in four 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.040
 people 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.040
 probably also fifty 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.390
 I probably got about 40 thousand more 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.010
 as I posted is is bet 9700 in the middle 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.230
 because I did not have the money for myself 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.290
 had taken 9700 remembering you have to 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.700
 to get money there 39 thousand with five 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.680
 people would probably be eight 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 history gaining between 70 and 80 thousand 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.490
 So you have the money that we 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.160
 It ends then, if there were eight 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.230
 70 thousand hectares to win there but at the end 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.510
 make more money so I'm going to take 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.090
 80 thousand here playing with your friends 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.670
 So the guy is running and do it soon. 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.380
 which is probably could be later 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.090
 about three hours that owns this video 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.190
 hawks after taking it out then it's not the fault 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.709
 mine and it's just that dude you go 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.020
 Since then 10,000 bets on you and all 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.020
 world bet 2011 itself and make the 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.790
 run and hit the sideline and then 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.820
 finish the race everyone will win 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.320

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.150

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.530
 so it's easy to hurry soon 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.500
 get the money now the guys 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.820

 friends all win by reminding the galley 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.430
 before he gave 300,000 because he could 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.100
 30 cases to each face is counted as 10 thousand 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.860
 then there on ps3 as is maximum 16 could 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.989
 earn 160,000 this thing that gives up to 8 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.310
