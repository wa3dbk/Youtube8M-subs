taking a look at meme generator meme

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.450 
taking a look at meme generator meme
generator<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.929> basically<00:00:04.770> just<00:00:05.040> what<00:00:05.370> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
generator is basically just what the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.880 
generator is basically just what the
name<00:00:05.609> says<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:06.089> generates<00:00:06.660> memes<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.290> and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
name says it generates memes for you and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.250 
name says it generates memes for you and
it<00:00:08.130> comes<00:00:08.309> pre-loaded<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.360> tons<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.019> memes

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
it comes pre-loaded with tons of memes

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.190 
it comes pre-loaded with tons of memes
and<00:00:11.150> if<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.300> scroll<00:00:12.690> through<00:00:12.750> them<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.080> it's

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and if I scroll through them all it's

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.209 
and if I scroll through them all it's
probably<00:00:13.290> taking<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> really<00:00:13.830> long<00:00:14.040> time

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
probably taking a really long time

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400 
probably taking a really long time

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
can click on it and then you see it has

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860 
can click on it and then you see it has
the<00:00:31.769> edit<00:00:32.040> options<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the edit options here but down here this

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.770 
the edit options here but down here this
is<00:00:33.960> an<00:00:34.050> example<00:00:34.110> button<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.340> example<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is an example button so for example that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.810 
is an example button so for example that
says<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.160> tells<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.180> typical

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
says you know tells you what a typical

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.540 
says you know tells you what a typical
what<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> typical<00:00:42.559> mean<00:00:43.559> would<00:00:43.770> say<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
what a typical mean would say with that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.410 
what a typical mean would say with that
picture<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:46.309> edit<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
picture and then you can edit what it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.050 
picture and then you can edit what it
says

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.060 

so<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:56.840> question<00:00:57.020> mark<00:00:57.350> there<00:00:57.560> and

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.150 

then<00:01:01.070> if<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.310> do<00:01:01.370> make<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:02.240> see<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:03.200> changes<00:01:04.100> the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
then if I do make it see it changes the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.070 
then if I do make it see it changes the
back<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.610> then<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.300> could<00:01:05.449> either<00:01:05.540> save<00:01:05.900> it

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
back and then you could either save it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.050 
back and then you could either save it
or<00:01:06.260> share<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.860> hit<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.580> share<00:01:07.790> Save

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
or share it if I hit the share Save

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.750 
or share it if I hit the share Save
button<00:01:08.260> we're<00:01:09.260> given<00:01:09.530> save<00:01:09.740> share<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.370> cancel

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
button we're given save share and cancel

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.910 
button we're given save share and cancel
and<00:01:10.940> then<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.630> course<00:01:11.930> if<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:12.110> hit<00:01:12.260> share<00:01:12.530> it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
this to so pretty quick pretty easy I've

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.980 
this to so pretty quick pretty easy I've
used<00:01:25.370> a<00:01:25.610> few<00:01:25.790> different<00:01:25.850> name<00:01:26.240> generators<00:01:26.750> and

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
used a few different name generators and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.080 
used a few different name generators and
this<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.320> probably<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.650> easiest<00:01:27.680> one<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.430> it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
this is probably the easiest one and it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.370 
this is probably the easiest one and it
comes<00:01:29.240> back<00:01:29.420> with<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.690> most<00:01:29.720> memes<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.229> I've
