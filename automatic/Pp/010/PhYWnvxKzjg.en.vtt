00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
crevasse effect within the ground itself

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.210 
crevasse effect within the ground itself
you<00:01:46.450> can<00:01:46.510> see<00:01:46.810> lot<00:01:47.080> more<00:01:47.320> level<00:01:47.650> of<00:01:47.740> more

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
you can see lot more level of more

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.430 
you can see lot more level of more
details<00:01:48.640> on<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.000> back<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.420> cornet<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.260> all

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
details on the back of the cornet so all

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.510 
details on the back of the cornet so all
that<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.650> possible<00:01:50.890> because<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
that is possible because of the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.460 
that is possible because of the
desolation<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.180> I'm<00:01:52.330> just<00:01:52.720> lighting<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.229> and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
desolation so I'm just lighting it and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.550 
desolation so I'm just lighting it and
you<00:01:53.710> can<00:01:53.860> see<00:01:54.070> all<00:01:54.369> of<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.180> happening

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can see all of this is happening

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.650 
you can see all of this is happening
dynamically<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.400> GPU<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:57.910> three<00:01:58.210> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
efficient manner because you know you're

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.540 
efficient manner because you know you're
going<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.780> saving<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.380> lot<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.709> power<00:02:21.010> from

with<00:02:31.120> Snapdragon<00:02:31.630> 805<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.380> what<00:02:32.500> we're

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
with Snapdragon 805 so what we're

animation<00:03:02.040> geometries<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.160> say<00:03:03.580> we're

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
animation geometries and say we're

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.890 
animation geometries and say we're
drawing<00:03:04.360> like<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.780> vegetation<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.850> then<00:03:07.150> you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
drawing like the vegetation and then you

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.940 
drawing like the vegetation and then you
know<00:03:08.610> shadows<00:03:10.050> PCF<00:03:11.050> shadow<00:03:11.290> which<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.620> person

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
know shadows PCF shadow which is person

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.860 
know shadows PCF shadow which is person
is<00:03:12.010> closed<00:03:12.280> filtering<00:03:12.670> for<00:03:12.820> shadows<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.750> know

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
is closed filtering for shadows you know

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.050 
is closed filtering for shadows you know
so<00:03:14.260> all<00:03:14.500> sort<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.040> things<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.820> would

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
so all sort of things that you would

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.759 
so all sort of things that you would
expect<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.959> OpenGL<00:03:17.709> desktop<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:18.910> directx11
