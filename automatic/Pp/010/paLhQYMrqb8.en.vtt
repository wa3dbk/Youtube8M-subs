00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.989
 I was, I know what you're doing when 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.049
 He was talking about the train. 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.130
 I knew where they still have interest. 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.680
 here not only does it mention a place that I 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.500
 I really like that to mention a 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.130
 story I know you hear you see in the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.810
 The streets that I see there are you 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.630
 asking where since it is a 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.310
 so special history because people 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.310
 Like giving this book 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.740
 thinks very special 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.530
 He is very smart and at the same time 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.660
 very naive he had to become a 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.840
 adult child to achieve 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.280
 overcome the sufferings of his life 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.350
 father and it is performance taken and it ends and 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.710
 you end up understanding that suffering is 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.630
 that he is sad because the father in a 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.850
 opala has money he looks at the campaign 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.400
 that because of life he did not want to 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.120
 if the father heard that then he 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.060
 try in a way so he can redeem himself 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.090
 so he is very good at heart only 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.340
 people do not realize it and I was a 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.970
 story can get anyone to 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.490
 understand why they do what they do 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.360
 It happens with his life and you end up 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:03.620
 we understand what you need 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.710
 This is a biographical account of José 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.050
 mauro de vasconcelos and he does not only count 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.350
 a life of a five year old boy 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.080
 almost 6 as he speaks or something 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:19.520
 for five and tells the story of many 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.580
 people had to pass us by 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.310
 realizes the humility of people to 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.040
 willingness to grow and beyond 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.430
 We find this a very 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.229
 true very very good to be then 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.530
 I think I would indicate for any 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:40.160
 person at any time and if that is 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.710
 a book that would indicate this here is and 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.570
 It will always be my favorite book. 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.790
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.510

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.120

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.540
