feel comfortable cloning a pet so why

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
feel comfortable cloning a pet so why
was<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.700> important<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.810> buried

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
was it so important for you to be buried

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.240 
was it so important for you to be buried
with<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:07.950> pets<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> reason<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.799> feel<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
with your pets the reason I feel it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
with your pets the reason I feel it's
important<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.850> because<00:01:11.930> they<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.080> my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
important is because they are my

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.760 
important is because they are my
children<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:16.049> how<00:01:16.200> many<00:01:16.320> pets<00:01:16.500> did<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
children and the how many pets did you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
children and the how many pets did you
have<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.159> had<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:18.210> three<00:01:18.420> pets<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.869> already

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140

have I had what three pets are already
buried<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> cemetery<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.880> now

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
buried at the cemetery I have one now

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.350 
buried at the cemetery I have one now
okay<00:01:21.659> my<00:01:22.590> reasoning<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.150> love

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
okay my reasoning is because you love

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
okay my reasoning is because you love
them<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.430> I've

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
them that much and because actually I've

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
them that much and because actually I've
never<00:01:26.610> even<00:01:27.000> thought<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> never<00:01:28.439> thought

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
never even thought of it I never thought

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
never even thought of it I never thought
in<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:28.950> mind<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.820> clone<00:01:30.060> my<00:01:30.630> pet

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
in my mind that I would clone my pet

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
in my mind that I would clone my pet
it's<00:01:31.590> simply<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.670> excuse<00:01:33.030> me<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> never

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it's simply I'm a excuse me I never

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's simply I'm a excuse me I never
thought<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:33.960> mind<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.680> bury<00:01:34.890> my

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
