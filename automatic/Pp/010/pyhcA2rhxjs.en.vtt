 zara hotel faces caught on moscow who 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.840
 located in the heart of the capital 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.120
 yes exactly there was an event 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 lg company held 25 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.180
 February who is now on screen guess here 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 in a pink sweater and write necessarily 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 about it in the comments under this release 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.060
 and I will tell you right away in a sweater 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 Kirkorov elite most journalist no no 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 no good lg electronics company 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 presented the 2015 model range 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.430
 years including unique frets 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.260
 curved screen television 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.420
 ultra hd 4k TVs from 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 40 to 100 5 inches and upgraded model 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.470
 read full hd cinema tv ideas 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.010
 the line of audio-video equipment was also 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.020
 updated 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.610
 as for televisions the most important thing 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.860
 what I brought myself for the company lji 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 choose a vector of further development of this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.719
 oled-panel and wendy technology plus they 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 He added to his still such to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 technology called double rgb 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.989
 in fact it is su pixel white which 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.390
 allows you to enhance the contrast and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.730
 increase the brightness and accuracy of transmitting 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.429
 traces from remarkably in fact that's what 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.409
 what the doctor ordered and I already saw it in 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:10.139
 alive i will tell you sure looks 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.139
 very cool in this regard and by 2015 

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:15.509
 years will be a wonderful second factor 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:18.299
 4k resolution which is now combined 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 sa ella technology of course is already 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.740
 It was not only the company lg but 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.109
 still in the current format it became 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.659
 cheaper and better and more practical and 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.729
 in fact, here are analogues I would probably 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.859
 could not bring with and wait at samsung yes 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.990
 cool but for example I strain here 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.899
 here are the notation that you can 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.279
 still it was somehow brighten and not 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.289
 confuse users with huge 

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:42.119
 the amount of terminology here is 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.999
 understandable will and technology is 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.219
 4k technology combined got oil 14 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.659
 to all this enough that's why companies 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.569
 lg in this regard 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.389
 unequivocally respect as for some 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.189
 additional chips and frills well 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:58.439
 let's start with the design the design is bad and 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.639
 quite justifies the expectations and knew how 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.799
 did you always know how to make karate 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.219
 TV I have variations 2014 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.950
 of the year 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.950
 but if we are talking about technology 2014 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.369
 years I will note something from 2 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.640
 role on the lineup in 2014 will not appear 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.410
 as for audio and video equipment here 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.319
 Just now we are talking about it 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.959
 now all speakers 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.180
 got the opportunity to contact one 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.700
 network and you can from one device 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.080
 play music on several 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.630
 devices at the same time will all play 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 parallel synchronously wonderful also 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.989
 if you like moving around the house 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.010
 you are worth a few cubic systems 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.200
 then you can switch without suture 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.510
 sound from one to another i'm trying it 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.799
 articulate so it would be easier then 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.810
 is if you were listening in the same room 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.310
 moved to another room and in this very 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.560
 the room where you went too began to play 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.090
 speaker system also appeared 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.829
 many interesting decisions plus small ones 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.450
 columns here is one of them coming soon 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.220
 In our review, for example, I can 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.959
 updated via the app 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.400
 bluetooth from smartphone imagine 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.170
 software so now 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.840
 Already wireless speakers also became 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.299
 smart if you go back to tv 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.790
 then continue the web theme with webos 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.170
 cool i'm now joking on percent this 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.209
 loading faster 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 the interface has become smoother access to content 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.019
 became quickly appeared a 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.220
 intelligent search and also a bunch 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.440
 additional variations 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.639
 not fichechek also updated remote 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.010
 remote control which is now 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.530
 one i have this magic motion 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.079
 not only does it come with the usual 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.060
 remote control, although I understand these variations 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.950
 still will be present but will 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.329
 here this one is one big way which 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.799
 now magic motion but with 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.780
 buttons with tsiferkami all as 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.209
 relies in general for universal 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.950
 finally also the operating room itself 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.170
 the system could still come on line 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.670
 2014 I'm here as the owner 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.530
 TV can tell me a little bit 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.500
 offensively let him gain percentage there 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.230
 10 let 15 not important it is important that 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.090
 I was updated and kept still I 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.280
 I doubt that there will be anyone 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.680
 u will want to update the TV annually 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.269
 that is, go buy a new well even 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.310
 smartphones for two years supported 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.410
 software plan it was 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.310
 would be logical and understandable but what to do to 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.930
 Unfortunately, we will not see this, but from 2015 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.700
 years of shooting line and look at 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.919
 how much is a thin piece of iron here 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.049
 in this very back, at a thickness of about 3 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.590
 bedrooms centimeters so he's not very 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.709
 lot 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.720
 in parallel with this of course all this 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.490
 looks absolutely phenomenal in terms of 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.740
 pictures okay on this i will 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.990
 I actually finish everything that 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.550
 could told many thanks to the company 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.800
