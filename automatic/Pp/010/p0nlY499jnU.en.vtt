00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to the season of tomatoes is 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.880
 coming to an end so with sadness 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 you have to start saying goodbye I'm going to do 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.690
 a salad that can be made with 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.640
 canned tomato these are still 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.160
 good but I 'm afraid that in a couple of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.460
 weeks will not be good first 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.199
 what we're going to do is peel the tomatoes 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.359
 you can make a cross cut at the base 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.429
 and put them in boiling water for 10 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.410
 seconds and it will be much easier but 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.410
 It will also take us a lot more work 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.649
 Y 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.450
 Once peeled, we chop them and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.450
 we put in a bowl for salad 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.570
 Y 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.540
 On the other hand, we are going to chop the onion 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.490
 we could also soften it by putting it 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.140
 in abundant water once chopped but 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.740
 well, this one is pretty soft, so 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.740
 necessary 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 ah 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350
 music 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.200
 we also put it on the goal 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.200
 and now let's chop a pickle 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.479
 if not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.040
 some black pitted olives 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.989
 and some capers we chop everything well 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.989
 so that the flavors are mixed 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.650
 well let's also put a little bit of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.450
 garlic this goes to taste as you can 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.879
 imagine if you do not want me to repeat you 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.959
 simply to do without, you can see that 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.959
 I put less than half 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 and finally we could put some 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.400
 chopped anchovies I'm going to put a little 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.739
 of bonito in virgin olive oil 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.629
 extra not too much so he does not steal the 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.629
 prominence to the rest of the ingredients 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.310
 and now we line it up a little bit of salt 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.370
 a good squirt of virgin olive oil 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.370
 extra 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.060
 a splash of vinegar we mix everything 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.280
 well and this if we let it rest 20 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.540
 minutes will integrate the flavors good 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.990
 I hope you enjoyed a hug 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.990
 see you later 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.040
 and point
