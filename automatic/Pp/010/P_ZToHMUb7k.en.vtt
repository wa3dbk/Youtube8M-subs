00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.289 
hey it's Jason
um<00:00:03.210> Tom<00:00:03.990> had<00:00:04.200> asked<00:00:04.440> me<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.830> put<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> video<00:00:05.790> of

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
um Tom had asked me to put a video of

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.120 
um Tom had asked me to put a video of
the<00:00:06.569> tea<00:00:06.750> board<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.170> landscape<00:00:07.649> mode<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.069> I

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
the tea board in landscape mode so I

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.310 
the tea board in landscape mode so I
thought<00:00:08.280> I'd<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.550> real<00:00:08.849> quick<00:00:09.139> to<00:00:10.139> show

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
thought I'd do that real quick to show

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.509 
thought I'd do that real quick to show
and<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.620> think<00:00:10.679> I've<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> better<00:00:11.309> way<00:00:11.460> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
and I think I've got a better way to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.289 
and I think I've got a better way to
film<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:13.519> put<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.790> front<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.150> my

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
film this here I put it in front of my

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.849 
film this here I put it in front of my
monitor<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> backlight<00:00:18.590> having<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> bright

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
monitor the backlight having the bright

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.740 
monitor the backlight having the bright
light<00:00:20.039> behind<00:00:20.340> them<00:00:20.550> makes<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> not<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.510> washed

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
light behind them makes it not so washed

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
light behind them makes it not so washed

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the address bar to type in a different

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.939 
the address bar to type in a different
address<00:00:58.850> if<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.449> keyboard<00:01:01.320> comes<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
address if the keyboard comes up in

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.840 
address if the keyboard comes up in
landscape<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:04.040> actually<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.339> mean<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
landscape like that so actually I mean I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.010 
landscape like that so actually I mean I
guess<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.210> good<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> wouldn't

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
guess it's good because you wouldn't

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
guess it's good because you wouldn't
want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> turn<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.189> type<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
want to have to turn it to type it you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.370 
want to have to turn it to type it you
know<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.540> were<00:01:09.630> looking<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> web<00:01:10.200> page

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
know if you were looking at a web page

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
know if you were looking at a web page
this<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.580> actually<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> little

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
this way but it's actually a little

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.700 
this way but it's actually a little
weird<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> try<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> type<00:01:13.500> with

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
weird because if you try to type with

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.810 
weird because if you try to type with
your<00:01:13.740> thumbs<00:01:14.270> like<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.420> used<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.759> like<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
get used to doing it it's a little like

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.149 
get used to doing it it's a little like
this<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:25.369> test<00:01:26.960> URL<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.070> not

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this is test URL it's a little it's not

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.899 
this is test URL it's a little it's not
dupes<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.259> bad<00:01:34.820> it's<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
dupes you know it's not bad it's a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.399 
dupes you know it's not bad it's a
little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.270> hard<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> reach<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
little bit hard to reach in here to the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.749 
little bit hard to reach in here to the
G<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:39.500> whatever<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
G or whatever because it's what it's so

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.230 
G or whatever because it's what it's so
wide<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.920> works<00:01:44.100> pretty<00:01:44.280> good<00:01:44.399> now<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
wide but it works pretty good now the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
wide but it works pretty good now the
thing<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:46.500> you've<00:01:46.680> got<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> keyboard

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
thing is when you've got the keyboard

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
thing is when you've got the keyboard
out<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.759> won't<00:01:47.970> notice<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.200> doesn't

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
out it won't notice that you it doesn't

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.480 
out it won't notice that you it doesn't
change<00:01:50.060> for<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.180> turn<00:01:51.990> turn<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> stays

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
change for your turn turn so it stays

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.230 
change for your turn turn so it stays
sideways<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> cancel<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:56.060> now<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
sideways you have to cancel out now it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.740 
sideways you have to cancel out now it
turns<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.189> go<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.790> get

like you do that much but yeah most of
the<00:02:17.650> other<00:02:17.770> places<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.280> keyboard<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.910> used

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
the other places the keyboard is used

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.170 
the other places the keyboard is used
like<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.480> example<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.200> notes<00:02:20.410> by<00:02:20.890> go<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.910> add

like for example and notes by go to add

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
like for example and notes by go to add
a<00:02:22.210> note<00:02:23.880> notes<00:02:24.880> doesn't<00:02:25.240> support<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.960> well<00:02:26.770> here

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
a note notes doesn't support a well here

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.270

there's no landscape mode at all for
notes<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.570> whole<00:02:37.870> landscape<00:02:38.380> keyboard

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.740 
notes so it's a whole landscape keyboard
and<00:02:39.250> that's<00:02:39.400> that's<00:02:39.820> true<00:02:40.120> with<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> lot<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.570> the

and that's that's true with a lot of the
things<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.080> lot<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> things<00:02:41.590> are<00:02:41.770> only

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
