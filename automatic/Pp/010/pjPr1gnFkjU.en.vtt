00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
they're gonna be able to withstand the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.330 
they're gonna be able to withstand the
pressure<00:01:14.240> same<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:17.450> diffuser<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.990> well

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
pressure same with the diffuser as well

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.600 
pressure same with the diffuser as well
make<00:01:20.340> sure<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.909> nice<00:01:21.180> high<00:01:21.420> quality<00:01:21.960> one

plastics<00:01:23.610> normally<00:01:23.939> safer<00:01:24.119> than<00:01:24.330> glass

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
plastics normally safer than glass

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.219 
plastics normally safer than glass
obviously<00:01:25.950> glass<00:01:26.189> looks<00:01:26.490> nicer<00:01:27.000> blends<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
obviously glass looks nicer blends in a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.640 
obviously glass looks nicer blends in a
little<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:28.590> better<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.040> tank<00:01:30.439> yeah<00:01:31.439> just

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
little bit better in the tank yeah just

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
little bit better in the tank yeah just
just<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:32.070> careful<00:01:32.400> sitting<00:01:32.670> those<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.030> well

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

sure they pushed on or screwed on as
tightly<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.689> go<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.810> those

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tightly as you can get them go on those

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.420 
tightly as you can get them go on those
popping<00:01:43.409> off<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:45.659> since<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
popping off because it's since like a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.850 
popping off because it's since like a
pressurized<00:01:48.090> burst<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> co2<00:01:48.930> wherever<00:01:49.680> its

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pressurized burst of co2 wherever its

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.190 
pressurized burst of co2 wherever its
point<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.780> quite<00:01:51.810> dangerous

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
point and that could be quite dangerous

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.170 
point and that could be quite dangerous
especially<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> hit<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> face<00:01:53.490> as

put<00:02:20.760> them<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.120> wall<00:02:21.530> my<00:02:22.530> someone<00:02:22.890> knock<00:02:23.490> them

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
put them up a wall my someone knock them

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.180 
put them up a wall my someone knock them
over<00:02:23.790> easily<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:25.200> also<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.620> careful<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:26.130> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
over easily and also be careful if you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.300 
over easily and also be careful if you
put<00:02:26.400> them<00:02:26.550> near<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:27.030> tank<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:28.500> he<00:02:28.860> only<00:02:29.130> takes

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
put them near your tank as he only takes

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.310 
put them near your tank as he only takes
it<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> tap<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.270> push<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> glass

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
it to tap it and you push on the glass

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.680 
it to tap it and you push on the glass
so<00:02:32.010> I've<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.130> wrapped<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.640> bit<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.030> bubble

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so I've just wrapped a bit of the bubble

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.100 
so I've just wrapped a bit of the bubble
wrap<00:02:33.810> around<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.250> bit<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.460> extra

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
wrap around it just for a bit of extra

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.610 
wrap around it just for a bit of extra
security<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.270> can<00:02:39.540> attach<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
security if you can attach it to the

has happened to me in the past you've
always<00:03:44.400> got<00:03:44.670> an<00:03:44.760> airstone<00:03:45.180> understand<00:03:46.140> why<00:03:46.320> -

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
always got an airstone understand why -

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.540 
always got an airstone understand why -
well<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.070> should<00:03:47.700> note<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.300> water<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.310> the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
well I should note the water but the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.020 
well I should note the water but the
best<00:03:51.420> solution<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:53.750> prevention<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.850> play

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
best solution is prevention so just play

you're fishing
another<00:04:14.700> key<00:04:14.880> factor<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.390> lighting<00:04:16.580> no<00:04:18.620> you

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
another key factor is lighting no you

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.159 
another key factor is lighting no you
don't<00:04:19.799> need<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:21.660> don't<00:04:21.840> need<00:04:21.960> to<00:04:22.080> know

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
don't need to be you don't need to know

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.270 
don't need to be you don't need to know
anything<00:04:22.320> about<00:04:22.470> engineer<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.130> know<00:04:23.250> I

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
anything about engineer you know I

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.250 
anything about engineer you know I
certainly<00:04:23.550> don't<00:04:23.880> my<00:04:24.480> dad<00:04:24.660> did<00:04:24.900> know<00:04:25.020> after

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
certainly don't my dad did know after

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.999 
certainly don't my dad did know after
that

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.550 

but<00:04:29.009> yeah<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:30.000> need<00:04:30.210> pretty<00:04:30.870> powerful<00:04:31.350> stuff

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
but yeah you need pretty powerful stuff

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.450 
but yeah you need pretty powerful stuff
to<00:04:31.770> be<00:04:31.830> used<00:04:32.039> in<00:04:32.160> co2<00:04:33.830> but<00:04:34.830> just<00:04:35.130> because<00:04:35.340> it's

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
to be used in co2 but just because it's

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.700 
to be used in co2 but just because it's
powerful<00:04:35.699> doesn't<00:04:36.000> mean<00:04:36.240> us<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.660> be<00:04:36.810> expensive

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
powerful doesn't mean us to be expensive

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.689 
powerful doesn't mean us to be expensive
so<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:39.060> don't<00:04:39.539> want<00:04:39.750> to

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
so you don't want to

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
brighter and a hell of a lot more

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.750 
brighter and a hell of a lot more
efficient<00:05:28.410> and<00:05:28.800> these<00:05:28.949> are<00:05:29.070> quite<00:05:29.190> warm<00:05:29.550> as

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
efficient and these are quite warm as

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.850 
efficient and these are quite warm as
well<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:30.630> Phil<00:05:30.960> just<00:05:31.139> here<00:05:31.320> is<00:05:31.470> quite<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> lot

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
well and Phil just here is quite a lot

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.680 
well and Phil just here is quite a lot
of<00:05:31.919> heat<00:05:32.070> coming<00:05:32.220> off<00:05:32.400> them<00:05:32.639> so<00:05:33.000> yeah<00:05:33.479> I<00:05:33.570> think

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
of heat coming off them so yeah I think

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.469 
of heat coming off them so yeah I think
she<00:05:33.990> water<00:05:34.169> temperature<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.270> keep<00:05:36.449> an

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
she water temperature so just keep an

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.219 
she water temperature so just keep an
eye<00:05:36.690> on<00:05:36.750> your<00:05:36.960> if<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.949> monitor<00:05:39.740> anything<00:05:40.740> else

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
eye on your if the monitor anything else

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:48.710 
eye on your if the monitor anything else
think<00:05:43.229> that's<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:45.650> oco-2<00:05:46.650> drop<00:05:47.220> checker<00:05:47.720> these

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
think that's it oco-2 drop checker these

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.939 
think that's it oco-2 drop checker these
are<00:05:48.930> quite<00:05:49.080> handy<00:05:49.470> they<00:05:49.970> turn<00:05:50.970> and<00:05:51.800> it's<00:05:52.800> in

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
are quite handy they turn and it's in

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.189 
are quite handy they turn and it's in
three<00:05:53.159> different<00:05:53.400> colors<00:05:53.789> so<00:05:54.300> blue<00:05:54.870> means

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
three different colors so blue means

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.860 
three different colors so blue means
you've<00:05:56.070> got<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.490> lot<00:05:56.729> of<00:05:56.759> oxygen<00:05:57.180> in<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.419> water

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
you've got a lot of oxygen in the water

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.320 
you've got a lot of oxygen in the water
green<00:05:58.770> means<00:05:59.009> you've<00:05:59.310> got<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.550> healthy<00:05:59.940> balance

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
green means you've got a healthy balance

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.749 
green means you've got a healthy balance
of<00:06:00.509> co2<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.380> oxygen<00:06:01.470> in<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.009> water<00:06:02.159> so<00:06:02.580> it's

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
of co2 and oxygen in the water so it's

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:07.040 
of co2 and oxygen in the water so it's
like<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.150> ideal<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:06.090> ideal<00:06:06.120> color<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.840> want

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
like the ideal the ideal color you want

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.310 
like the ideal the ideal color you want
for<00:06:07.500> a<00:06:07.530> planted<00:06:07.949> aquarium<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:08.810> so<00:06:09.810> jug<00:06:10.110> goes

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
for a planted aquarium and so jug goes

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.140 
for a planted aquarium and so jug goes
yellow<00:06:10.650> which<00:06:10.949> means<00:06:11.220> there's<00:06:11.460> way<00:06:11.669> too<00:06:11.729> much

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
yellow which means there's way too much

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.999 
yellow which means there's way too much
co2<00:06:12.389> in<00:06:12.720> the<00:06:12.780> water<00:06:13.020> and<00:06:13.380> you<00:06:13.680> fish<00:06:13.830> you're
