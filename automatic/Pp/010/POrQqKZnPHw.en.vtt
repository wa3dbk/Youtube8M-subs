revolved in iOS 5 but Apple didn't

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.920 
revolved in iOS 5 but Apple didn't
discuss<00:00:28.450> so<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.320> first<00:00:29.470> one<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:29.890> going<00:00:30.250> to<00:00:30.340> be

discuss so the first one is going to be

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.410 
discuss so the first one is going to be
creating<00:00:31.930> your<00:00:32.200> own<00:00:33.420> vibration

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
creating your own vibration

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.810 
creating your own vibration

can<00:02:01.380> create<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.650> new<00:02:01.860> vibration<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> this

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
can create your new vibration and this

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.530 
can create your new vibration and this
is<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.370> says<00:02:05.520> tap<00:02:06.360> to

is what we want to do so it says tap to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900 
is what we want to do so it says tap to
create<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.870> new<00:02:06.990> vibration<00:02:07.680> pad<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.759> all

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
create a new vibration pad so that's all

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:22.490 
create a new vibration pad so that's all
you<00:02:09.060> need<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.479> guys<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.240> there<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.989> go<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you need to do guys and there you go and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:36.240 
you need to do guys and there you go and
you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.709> actually<00:02:22.830> play<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.340> back<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.700> well

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.980 

and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.240> save<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.480> as<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.840> new

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
and then you can save it as a new

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.880 
and then you can save it as a new
vibration<00:02:38.650> pad<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.010> give<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.520> name<00:02:40.890> which

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
vibration pad and give it a name which

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.100 
vibration pad and give it a name which
you<00:02:42.010> call<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.310> one<00:02:42.520> test<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.960> give

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
you call this one test so if I just give

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.280 
you call this one test so if I just give
myself<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.740> phone<00:02:45.220> call<00:02:45.750> put<00:02:46.750> my<00:02:46.870> phone<00:02:47.110> on

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
myself a phone call put my phone on

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:58.290 
myself a phone call put my phone on
silent<00:02:47.760> first<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.910> all<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:56.640> can<00:02:57.640> see<00:02:57.880> that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
silent first of all you can see that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.420 
silent first of all you can see that
it's<00:02:58.450> using<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.840> new<00:02:59.130> vibration<00:03:00.130> pattern

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it's using the new vibration pattern

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.320 
it's using the new vibration pattern
just<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:02.310> we'll<00:03:03.310> leave<00:03:03.520> that<00:03:03.580> alone<00:03:06.330> but

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
just there we'll leave that alone but

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.680 
just there we'll leave that alone but
what<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.630> can<00:03:07.780> also<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.410> assign<00:03:08.800> these<00:03:09.690> new

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
what you can also do is assign these new

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.449 
what you can also do is assign these new
vibrations<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:12.280> different<00:03:12.640> people<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:14.459> how

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
vibrations to different people and how

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.540 
vibrations to different people and how
you<00:03:15.520> do<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.180> go<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.910> phone

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
you do that is you go in to the phone

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.360 
you do that is you go in to the phone
you<00:03:21.550> would<00:03:21.700> go<00:03:21.850> into<00:03:22.000> your<00:03:22.150> contacts<00:03:22.630> and
