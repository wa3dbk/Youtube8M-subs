00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.700
 today we are going to present an experiment 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.100
 entertaining and easy to do for 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.590
 children and young people who are interested in 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.410
 science 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.070
 the experiment is called entangling 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.700
 polymers and with which we need the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.860
 following materials 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.320
 a pregnancy and a container not level 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 a yellow waves 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:38.260
 a teaspoon with the cold the ideal is 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.540
 that is for wood boric acid also 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.270
 known as balls 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.270
 distilled water and absorbent paper 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.110
 process 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.800
 first we make a solution in the satin 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.989
 putting distilled water and a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.989
 teaspoon rafa de moras 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.970
 ah 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.970
 we come back to have a solution 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.270
 then in the container we put a part 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.840
 of ecology 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.399
 and a little distilled water 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.399
 only a little 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.509
 remember that we should let it be the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.470
 first solution will be all the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.470
 errors toward the end of the pass 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.400
 then we incorporate the first solution to 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.569
 the cold tail 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.569
 stirring to form a dough 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.569
 fluffy 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:29.379
 We will use the absorbent paper for 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.379
 avoid excess water from our 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.180
 scientific explanation of the experiment 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.200
 consists of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.040
 with the morato of study 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.450
 a cross - linked polymer that would be a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.980
 polyvinyl acetate x 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.980
 the sodium treatment 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.720
 giving positive union 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.290
 pedrola 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.319
 the ions from behind 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.950
 in the in the long chains of acetate 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.410
 polyvinyl 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.290
 also by hydrogen bonds 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.829
 filling water molecules 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.489
 these have a tendency to escape 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:46.480
 simple evaporation so we should not 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.750
 leave it too much time outdoors 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.610
 if we let it dry we get a 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.060
 that is to say 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.060
 yes 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.480
 dreaded 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.480
 with yellow dye
