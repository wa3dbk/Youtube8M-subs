00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.810

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.480
 rock islands 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.400
 but you can't not love you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.889
 key E minor key native 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.740
 eat a couple of verses 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.949
 I will play the first verse by searching the second 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.609
 couplet battle as you like 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.609
 like it so look and we will disassemble 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:40.610
 I will know when one probably 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.460
 to go crazy you can 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:49.460
 be you pretty and nasty 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.330
 but you or bilich is impossible but you are not 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.330
 impossible to love 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.610
 but 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.890
 I know how to bite these clubs but in a lie 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.010
 you yourself can be ruined 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.100
 ridiculous 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:24.750
 and a group but you never 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.750
 you will forget but you will never forget 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:49.750
 let's start with parsing busting and battle 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.780
 bust we play this way on 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.709
 minor 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.709
 played with bass string 6 6 3 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.100
 6 3 2 3 1 3 2 3 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:22.850
 here so I will show on what chord 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.850
 what bass string play watch fight 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.560
 such a fight 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:38.859
 slowly we look down two blows and two 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.859
 hit to the top 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.470
 after two blows up play down 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 down played over 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.010
 turn it down and after it down louder and third 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.060
 bang down again 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 like this again 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:27.000
 those that are quieter, you can play on the base 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:29.480
 strings 6 5 4 and the last hit with us 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.480
 up 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.140
 Here we would have turned out 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.180
 chords 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.310
 we have a few chords in this song 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.060
 there are only five first chord in E minor 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:00.250
 nestles 4 5 strings on the second palm 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:03.340
 bass string 6 if brute playing 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.280
 if the fight all the strings and like 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.120
 the next chord will be in E major 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.560
 also that in E minor only we press more 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.920
 index finger third string 1 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.390
 watt all with bass strings with a fight 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:25.430
 remains the same will be a chord with 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:28.190
 The base note is A flat with salt 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.590
 Color remains chord E major simply 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.280
 little finger press the sixth string on 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.210
 fourth fret you 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:42.980
 here so the next chord in a minor 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:46.400
 bass string is played 5 1 pick up 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.270
 chord as taken open 1 2 on 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:55.700
 first fret 3 4 on the second and 5 open 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.490
 basic iteration is played when we play 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.420
 it is desirable to drown out the sixth chord 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.420
 thumb 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.210
 not to cling because there will be a lot 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.200
 mud 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:14.740
 the next chord in D major 1 3 on the second 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.970
 and 2 on the third fret 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.970
 barefoot and open 4 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.200
 when we play by fight if we can 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.150
 control play four below 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.620
 thoughts are hard to control 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.700
 can squeeze with lightly 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.060
 thumb 2 upper strings and 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.050
 and with us they will not sound ie their 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:44.800
 and do not need to play when we play battle 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:48.820
 the next chord in G major is taken as 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:57.610
 1 6 on the third tray and 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:06:00.270
 5 on the second bass string 6 battles playing 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.270
 all strings 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:13.580
 understandable and there will be a chord C seventh chord 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:17.330
 1 3 and 5 on the second palm 4 on the first 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.330
 bulk 5 string 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.050
 We can play the sixth string 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.950
 no need for us to play and we can here 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.740
 middle finger obsessed fifth string and 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:34.090
 we can lift us up a little 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.090
 the sixth string is automatically muffled 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.220
 if it's hard so again 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:43.139
 put your thumb on the sixth string 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.139
 and she will not sound us 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.590
 these are the chords in this song and perhaps 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.020
 the whole song is nothing else there that 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.490
 it would be worth showing and so try with you 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.599
 Of course everything will work out 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.599
 the main desire and patience
