well<00:00:28.220> I<00:00:28.279> understand<00:00:28.670> why<00:00:28.730> they<00:00:28.880> call<00:00:29.000> it<00:00:29.119> a

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
well I understand why they call it a

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.480 
well I understand why they call it a
flathead<00:00:29.630> Don<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:30.080> how<00:00:30.170> does<00:00:30.320> it<00:00:30.440> work<00:00:30.590> well

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
flathead Don but how does it work well

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.420 
flathead Don but how does it work well
it<00:00:32.150> is<00:00:32.270> flat<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:32.960> that's<00:00:33.680> how<00:00:33.950> it<00:00:34.100> got<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
it is flat and that's how it got the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.430 
it is flat and that's how it got the
nickname<00:00:34.580> you<00:00:35.420> can<00:00:35.570> check<00:00:35.720> all<00:00:35.870> these<00:00:36.050> cooling

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440

not here this is called a side valve
engine<00:00:44.720> this<00:00:45.230> is<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:45.410> very<00:00:45.620> inefficient<00:00:46.040> design

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
engine this is a very inefficient design

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.450 
engine this is a very inefficient design
but<00:00:47.630> it's<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.930> hardy<00:00:48.290> workhorse<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.010> probably

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
but it's a hardy workhorse and probably

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.340 
but it's a hardy workhorse and probably
the<00:00:49.610> most<00:00:49.760> reliable<00:00:50.149> engine<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:50.989> Harley

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
the most reliable engine that Harley

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.970 
the most reliable engine that Harley
ever<00:00:51.559> came<00:00:51.920> out<00:00:51.950> with<00:00:52.250> Tony<00:00:52.540> in<00:00:53.540> fact<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.470> had

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
ever came out with Tony in fact this had

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.680 
ever came out with Tony in fact this had
his<00:00:55.190> off<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.550> bike<00:00:55.760> that's<00:00:56.000> probably<00:00:56.270> 65

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
his off the bike that's probably 65

years<00:00:57.170> old<00:00:57.380> this<00:00:57.980> head<00:00:58.280> will<00:00:58.460> still<00:00:58.730> be<00:00:58.880> on

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
years old this head will still be on

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.910 
years old this head will still be on
motorcycles<00:00:59.750> sixty-five<00:01:00.290> years<00:01:00.320> from<00:01:00.770> now

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
motorcycles sixty-five years from now

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.689 
motorcycles sixty-five years from now
maybe<00:01:01.340> 200<00:01:02.030> years<00:01:02.239> from<00:01:02.450> now<00:01:02.800> but<00:01:03.800> it's<00:01:04.489> not

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
maybe 200 years from now but it's not

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.550 
maybe 200 years from now but it's not
very<00:01:05.000> fast<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.720> reason<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:06.170> not<00:01:06.200> very

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
very fast and the reason it's not very

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.310 
very fast and the reason it's not very
fast<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:07.430> because<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.320> combustion

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
fast is because of the the combustion

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.980 
fast is because of the the combustion
chamber<00:01:09.680> design<00:01:09.729> very<00:01:10.729> poor<00:01:11.090> flame<00:01:11.420> travel

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
chamber design very poor flame travel

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.190 
chamber design very poor flame travel
very<00:01:12.800> low<00:01:13.070> percentage<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.880> burn<00:01:14.149> I<00:01:14.479> mean<00:01:15.080> this

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
very low percentage of burn I mean this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.060 
very low percentage of burn I mean this
is<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.440> real<00:01:15.710> pollution<00:01:16.280> monster<00:01:17.950> dying<00:01:18.950> how

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
is a real pollution monster dying how

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.480 
is a real pollution monster dying how
come<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.340> one's<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:19.729> heavy<00:01:20.920> well<00:01:21.920> Tony<00:01:22.159> it's

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
come this one's so heavy well Tony it's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.910 
come this one's so heavy well Tony it's
made<00:01:22.670> out<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.850> cast<00:01:23.119> iron<00:01:23.420> steel<00:01:23.900> why<00:01:24.710> it's

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
made out of cast iron steel why it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.380 
made out of cast iron steel why it's
called<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.280> knucklehead<00:01:25.700> becomes<00:01:26.150> pretty

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
called a knucklehead becomes pretty

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.390 
called a knucklehead becomes pretty
obvious<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.990> there's<00:01:27.290> big<00:01:27.409> knuckle<00:01:27.799> nuts<00:01:28.190> that

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
obvious is there's big knuckle nuts that

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.480 
obvious is there's big knuckle nuts that
go<00:01:28.549> on<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.850> end<00:01:28.970> here<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.010> Harley<00:01:31.010> riders<00:01:31.340> are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.500 
looks like you can fry eggs at the top
is<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> why<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.140> called<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.580> well<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.300> pan

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
is that why it's called on well the pan

of<00:02:15.360> tin<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> take<00:02:17.940> them<00:02:18.090> off<00:02:18.270> they

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
of tin and if you take them off they

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.030 
of tin and if you take them off they
look<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.050> pan<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:19.860> of

look just like a pan and that's of

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.120 
look just like a pan and that's of
course<00:02:20.090> how<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.270> got<00:02:21.569> its<00:02:21.750> name<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.739> reason

they<00:02:23.250> went<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.790> engine<00:02:24.239> over<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
they went to this engine over the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.809 
they went to this engine over the
knuckle<00:02:24.959> hat<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> huge<00:02:26.520> improvement

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
knuckle hat it's not a huge improvement

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.370 
knuckle hat it's not a huge improvement
over<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.300> knuckle<00:02:27.630> head<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:27.959> an<00:02:28.050> improvement

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
over the knuckle head but an improvement

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.460 
over the knuckle head but an improvement
nonetheless<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.720> heads<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.110> made<00:02:31.290> out

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
nonetheless the the heads are made out

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.650 
nonetheless the the heads are made out
of<00:02:31.500> aluminum<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.280> they're<00:02:32.310> lighter<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.450> also

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
of aluminum so they're lighter it's also

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.930 
of aluminum so they're lighter it's also
an<00:02:33.870> easier<00:02:34.200> engine<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> work<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.069> because<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
an easier engine to work on because the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.250 
an easier engine to work on because the
knuckle<00:02:36.239> head<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:38.390> there<00:02:39.390> Lakers<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.019> leak

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
knuckle head is there Lakers they leak

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
knuckle head is there Lakers they leak
oil<00:02:40.500> all<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> time<00:02:41.069> it's<00:02:41.280> very<00:02:41.310> difficult<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
oil all the time it's very difficult to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.270 
oil all the time it's very difficult to
stop<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.810> pan<00:02:43.050> had<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.800> didn't<00:02:44.160> leak

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
stop them the pan had it didn't leak

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.309 
stop them the pan had it didn't leak
well<00:02:44.519> as<00:02:44.670> much<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.480> all<00:02:45.720> Harley's<00:02:46.170> of

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
well as much but like all Harley's of

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.380 
well as much but like all Harley's of
the<00:02:46.410> day<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.860> certainly<00:02:47.250> marked<00:02:47.550> its<00:02:47.670> spot<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the day it certainly marked its spot I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.960 
the day it certainly marked its spot I
heard<00:02:49.380> old<00:02:49.560> shovels<00:02:49.980> never<00:02:50.190> died<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
heard old shovels never died on is that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.880 
heard old shovels never died on is that
true<00:02:51.180> well<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:51.540> die<00:02:51.780> peated<00:02:52.380> Lee<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:52.709> there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
true well they die peated Lee but there

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.270 
true well they die peated Lee but there
rebuildable<00:02:53.430> forever<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> flathead

it's<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:57.239> an<00:02:57.360> engine<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.200> be

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
it's it's an engine that you have to be

it's it's an engine that you have to be
a<00:02:58.350> mechanic<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.130> want<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.489> hold<00:02:59.610> for<00:02:59.850> any

length<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.360> time<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.980> improvement<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.489> this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
length of time the improvement of this

engine over the panhead again it's not

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.039 
engine over the panhead again it's not
very<00:03:05.250> dramatic<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.120> same<00:03:06.390> as<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> pan<00:03:06.840> head

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.380 
very dramatic the same as the pan head
over<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> knuckle<00:03:07.680> head<00:03:07.799> but<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.180> head

is made out of aluminum and this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.670 
is made out of aluminum and this

had<00:03:13.920> they<00:03:14.100> transfer<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.940> lot<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.360> valvetrain

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
had they transfer a lot of valvetrain

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.930 
had they transfer a lot of valvetrain
noise<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.130> shovel<00:03:17.400> head<00:03:17.519> became<00:03:17.910> a

noise so the shovel head became a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.930
