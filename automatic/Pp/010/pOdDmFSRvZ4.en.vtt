00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.430 

this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.569> single<00:00:03.779> building<00:00:04.049> inside<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.650> Co

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
this is a single building inside of Co

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.049 
this is a single building inside of Co
which<00:00:07.440> we<00:00:07.560> saw<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.770> bigger<00:00:07.980> seen<00:00:08.219> before<00:00:08.790> just

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
which we saw the bigger seen before just

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.270 
which we saw the bigger seen before just
getting<00:00:09.869> back<00:00:09.959> into<00:00:10.019> about<00:00:10.499> the<00:00:10.679> correct<00:00:10.950> game

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
getting back into about the correct game

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.900 
getting back into about the correct game
scale<00:00:11.789> zoom<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.959> guys<00:00:13.079> see<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.589> look<00:00:13.709> like

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.339 

and<00:00:17.449> again<00:00:17.660> these<00:00:17.750> are<00:00:17.869> all<00:00:17.900> very<00:00:17.990> preliminary

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
and again these are all very preliminary

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.550 
and again these are all very preliminary
because<00:00:18.890> a<00:00:19.009> for<00:00:19.789> example<00:00:20.169> to<00:00:21.169> show<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
because a for example to show you the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.080 
because a for example to show you the
areas<00:00:21.829> that<00:00:21.859> I<00:00:21.980> think<00:00:22.070> are<00:00:22.220> working<00:00:22.489> about

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
areas that I think are working about

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.400 
areas that I think are working about
like<00:00:23.300> they<00:00:23.419> will<00:00:23.570> in<00:00:23.599> the<00:00:23.750> final<00:00:24.050> version<00:00:24.199> and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
like they will in the final version and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.710 
like they will in the final version and
once<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:24.739> aren't<00:00:25.090> this<00:00:26.090> ground<00:00:26.359> texture<00:00:26.630> is

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
once it aren't this ground texture is

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.299 
once it aren't this ground texture is
working<00:00:26.989> particularly<00:00:27.230> well<00:00:27.380> but<00:00:28.039> you<00:00:28.099> notice

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
working particularly well but you notice

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.609 
working particularly well but you notice
this<00:00:28.430> tree<00:00:28.669> is<00:00:28.789> picks<00:00:29.029> lighting<00:00:29.300> a<00:00:29.359> bit<00:00:29.619> and

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
this tree is picks lighting a bit and

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.290 
this tree is picks lighting a bit and
that<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.340> technology<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:31.939> not<00:00:31.969> doing<00:00:32.269> that

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
that the technology is not doing that

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.640 
that the technology is not doing that
it's<00:00:32.480> just<00:00:32.509> because<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:32.989> original<00:00:33.140> artists

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
it's just because the original artists

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.220 
it's just because the original artists
who<00:00:34.550> didn't<00:00:34.790> create<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.239> dense<00:00:35.570> enough<00:00:35.870> texture

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
who didn't create a dense enough texture

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.590 
who didn't create a dense enough texture
map<00:00:36.470> for<00:00:37.430> that<00:00:37.460> for<00:00:37.970> that<00:00:38.030> particular<00:00:38.120> scene

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
map for that for that particular scene

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.360 
map for that for that particular scene
and<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:39.589> one<00:00:39.949> of<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.040> things<00:00:40.190> we're<00:00:40.309> trying

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
and so one of the things we're trying

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.210 
and so one of the things we're trying
make<00:00:40.579> sure<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.760> doesn't<00:00:40.970> do<00:00:41.210> is<00:00:41.780> look

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
make sure it doesn't do is look

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.770 
make sure it doesn't do is look
classically<00:00:43.220> 3d<00:00:43.790> in<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.149> sense<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.449> watching

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
classically 3d in the sense of watching

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.069 
classically 3d in the sense of watching
pixelated<00:00:45.710> stuff<00:00:46.149> and<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.449> shouldn't<00:00:47.870> see

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
pixelated stuff and so you shouldn't see

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.780 
pixelated stuff and so you shouldn't see
any<00:00:48.470> of<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.649> we<00:00:49.129> did<00:00:49.250> final<00:00:49.519> version

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
any of that we did final version

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.820 
any of that we did final version
similarly<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:50.900> see<00:00:50.960> here<00:00:51.290> along<00:00:51.409> the<00:00:51.530> top<00:00:51.680> of

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
similarly you see here along the top of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.710 
similarly you see here along the top of
this<00:00:51.949> yeah<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.820> should<00:00:53.000> also<00:00:53.119> not<00:00:53.360> be<00:00:53.540> there

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
this yeah that should also not be there

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.350 
this yeah that should also not be there
okay<00:00:54.019> this<00:00:54.979> was<00:00:55.159> done<00:00:55.309> with<00:00:55.759> an<00:00:55.909> 8-bit

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
okay this was done with an 8-bit

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.210 
okay this was done with an 8-bit
renderer<00:00:56.839> and<00:00:57.049> the<00:00:57.500> current<00:00:57.710> renderer<00:00:57.890> in<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
renderer and the current renderer in the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.840 
renderer and the current renderer in the
game<00:00:58.369> is<00:00:58.460> actually<00:00:58.580> 16-bit<00:00:59.269> VGA<00:01:00.009> and<00:01:01.009> so<00:01:01.280> it

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
game is actually 16-bit VGA and so it

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.829 
game is actually 16-bit VGA and so it
actually<00:01:02.089> even<00:01:02.150> looks<00:01:02.390> much<00:01:02.540> better<00:01:02.689> this

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
actually even looks much better this

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.049 
actually even looks much better this
Plus<00:01:03.080> this<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.549> inkjet<00:01:04.549> color<00:01:04.729> printer

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
Plus this is a inkjet color printer

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.359 
Plus this is a inkjet color printer

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
for example I don't think Steven

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.420

competitor of ours

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.000 
competitor of ours
nor<00:05:13.610> do<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.850> think<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:14.590> Steven<00:05:15.590> Spielberg<00:05:15.890> has

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.900 
nor do I think that Steven Spielberg has
much<00:05:16.220> to<00:05:16.400> fear<00:05:16.990> from<00:05:17.990> any<00:05:18.170> of<00:05:18.290> us<00:05:18.760> but<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:19.790> think

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
much to fear from any of us but I think

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.220 
much to fear from any of us but I think
of<00:05:20.150> all<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.330> people<00:05:20.420> our<00:05:20.600> industry<00:05:20.930> people
