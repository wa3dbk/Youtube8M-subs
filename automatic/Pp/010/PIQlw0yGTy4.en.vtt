it is it's just like the other PS Vita
that<00:00:25.380> came<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:25.619> earlier<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.580> lighter

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that came out earlier but it's lighter

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
that came out earlier but it's lighter
it's<00:00:27.359> thinner<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:29.000> it's<00:00:30.000> basically<00:00:30.590> retool

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it's thinner it's it's basically retool

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.040 
it's thinner it's it's basically retool
it<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> brand<00:00:32.489> new<00:00:32.669> screen<00:00:33.540> instead<00:00:33.930> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it has a brand new screen instead of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
it has a brand new screen instead of
using<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> 0<00:00:34.380> LED<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.489> using<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
using the 0 LED it's using just a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
using the 0 LED it's using just a
regular<00:00:36.270> LCD<00:00:37.020> screen<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.950> guess<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> LCD

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
regular LCD screen and I guess the LCD

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.520 
regular LCD screen and I guess the LCD
screen<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> definitely<00:00:39.600> much<00:00:39.989> more<00:00:40.050> time

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530

more<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.220> some<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.520> games<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
more to get some more games out but this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
more to get some more games out but this
is<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.200> start<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.590> far<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.860> getting
