00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.570
 Each paper on the theme of cherry blossoms 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.529
 It is no exaggeration 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.199
 About 12 million effective pixels 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.539
 And while it's this stylish body, it's expensive to go public 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.509
 The result is easy to press the liquid crystal 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.339
 Because the bench also uses AA batteries 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 Even when the battery gets crispy on the go 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.009
 So much 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.239
 Even if you are not 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.620
 At ease 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.700
 It is taken in beautifully 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 I'm going to run ia mode 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.930
 In this photography mode change 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.360
 When i-mode is selected 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 Automatically set the optimal mode from among Kameda Daisuke Dori applications 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.160
 Will 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.680
 For those who say that the opening alone is not enough 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 It also has such an interesting feature 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250
 From the menu 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 I was sent by Matsui 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.030
 Please take a look 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 Hope for a bright impression 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.580
 Kimball finished in fashion with a retro feel 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.110
 Pointed out that it contributes to cancellation 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.080
 And finish in a dramatic atmosphere in a soft atmosphere 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 Which new data can be obtained such as wedding 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.990
 Besides that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.540
 Interface out to moving objects 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 It also has a function to move automatically 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.720
 Arrest of moving people 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.400
 I was able to achieve 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.480
 It is said that only this function is attached 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.310
 Take a picture 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.960
 However, it has become 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.990
 12 million pixels per month 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.620
 Optical 4x zoom 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.620
 Large, easy-to-see 2.7-inch LCD monitor 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.450
 Imagine ia mode that allows anyone to take pictures easily 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 Four kinds of magic that can be enjoyed with photos have disappeared 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.620
 A company employee near Takayuki Sakai receives and holds in peace in Kitagawa 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.960
 It is done 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.310
 Arashiyama Hanatoro even after winning 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.770
 Camera high price 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.569
 Before the game
