00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.830
 858 first time I arrive early at 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.010
 good work - those days when you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.230
 I advanced the damn clock to start 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.720
 press any key whatsoever 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.859
 anybody I see is that the deputy does not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.859
 have have any 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.270
 hello youtube friends today I bring you the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.800
 mod a game for counter strike 1.6 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.870
 this mod is very good at the moment of 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.060
 want to practice with all the weapons of 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.100
 counter strike because this mod is about 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.309
 make the largest sum of deaths and so go 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.350
 leveling up in each level will go 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.570
 giving another weapon better to the previous one and 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.970
 so you can go killing more and more rivals 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.690
 but not everything is to go up and level up 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.670
 You can also lose levels as well 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.500
 If a rival stabs you, you will lose a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.690
 level and in turn you will lose a weapon and 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.520
 you will return to the previous level but the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.400
 who has stabbed you wins a level or 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.250
 be that also a good enough weapon of 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.020
 talk and let's start we go to the link 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.800
 that I will leave you in the description of 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.800
 xd video 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.110
 we wait five seconds 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.110
 corresponding 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.970
 and we give in jump advertising 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.450
 now we give the beautiful green button 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.900
 I cancel it because I already have it 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.260
 for them to walk the way they have to 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.060
 install in the mx mod any version 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.980
 in case you do not know how to install them leave them the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.650
 link of the video where he taught how 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.500
 install it 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.260
 I already have it installed then 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.860
 we open this installer will ask you 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860
 password 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.620
 now we give in to examine and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.330
 we select the strict folder that is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.900
 find inside your counter strike 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.319
 we give in install and then yes to everything 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.959
 now I will leave you a demonstration of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.959

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.170

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.430
