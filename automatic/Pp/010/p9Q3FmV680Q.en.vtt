00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
it out and lightly defining the crease

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.860 
it out and lightly defining the crease
of<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.520> eye<00:03:39.610> so<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.300> doesn't<00:03:40.600> look<00:03:40.690> like

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
of the eye so it doesn't look like

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.510 
of the eye so it doesn't look like
there's<00:03:41.080> a<00:03:41.140> ton<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.440> shadow<00:03:41.770> there<00:03:42.100> but<00:03:42.370> it

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
there's a ton of shadow there but it

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.700 
there's a ton of shadow there but it
just<00:03:42.790> pops<00:03:43.540> your<00:03:43.780> eyes<00:03:43.900> out<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> little<00:03:44.470> bit

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
just pops your eyes out a little bit

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:56.160 
just pops your eyes out a little bit
more

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.410

one<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.250> wanted<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.819> use<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.180> matte<00:04:01.420> shade<00:04:01.780> and

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
one you wanted I use the matte shade and

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.930 
one you wanted I use the matte shade and
I'm<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.709> taking<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:03.160> little<00:04:03.400> brush<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.790> I'm

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
I'm just taking a little brush and I'm

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.820 
I'm just taking a little brush and I'm
lightly<00:04:04.569> pulling<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.080> outer<00:04:05.260> corner<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.709> my

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
lightly pulling the outer corner of my

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.040 
lightly pulling the outer corner of my
eye<00:04:05.860> not<00:04:06.370> really<00:04:06.700> pulling<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.569> just<00:04:07.810> kind<00:04:08.020> of

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
eye not really pulling it just kind of

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.650 
eye not really pulling it just kind of
holding<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.680> can<00:04:08.920> create<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.880> straight

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
holding it so I can create a straight

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.800 
holding it so I can create a straight
line<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.860> kind<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.640> lightly<00:04:13.300> line<00:04:13.660> my

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
line and kind of just lightly line my

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.660 
line and kind of just lightly line my
eyes<00:04:13.959> with<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.290> powder<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.860> then<00:04:15.400> I'm<00:04:15.520> taking

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
eyes with the powder and then I'm taking

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.060 
eyes with the powder and then I'm taking
that<00:04:16.030> medium<00:04:16.540> color<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.169> I'm<00:04:17.560> just<00:04:17.769> going<00:04:18.040> to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
that medium color and I'm just going to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.400 
that medium color and I'm just going to
take<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.730> on<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.940> pencil<00:04:19.359> brush<00:04:19.480> and<00:04:19.720> line<00:04:20.200> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
take that on a pencil brush and line the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.870 
take that on a pencil brush and line the
lower<00:04:20.440> lash<00:04:20.889> line<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.549> give<00:04:21.700> some

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
lower lash line just to give some

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.090 
lower lash line just to give some
definition<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.720> blend<00:04:23.230> look<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.770> it's<00:04:23.919> not

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
definition and blend look so it's not

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.780

there<00:04:24.400> down<00:04:24.610> there

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.610 

so<00:04:32.540> then<00:04:32.690> I'm<00:04:32.780> just<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.230> curl<00:04:33.410> my<00:04:33.470> lashes

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
so then I'm just going to curl my lashes

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.280 
so then I'm just going to curl my lashes
and<00:04:34.070> apply<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.790> layer<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.630> Maybelline<00:04:36.050> full

and<00:04:36.410> soft<00:04:36.560> mascara<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.460> perfect<00:04:37.880> because

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
and soft mascara this is perfect because

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.150 
and soft mascara this is perfect because
it's<00:04:38.300> waterproof<00:04:38.590> focus<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.830> base<00:04:39.980> of

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
it's waterproof focus on the base of

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.740 
it's waterproof focus on the base of
your<00:04:40.190> lashes<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:40.850> really<00:04:41.120> worked<00:04:41.450> that

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
your lashes and really worked that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.020 
your lashes and really worked that
mascara<00:04:42.260> in<00:04:42.440> there<00:04:42.620> first<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.220> get<00:04:43.340> volume<00:04:43.790> and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
mascara in there first to get volume and

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.580 
mascara in there first to get volume and
then<00:04:44.210> touch<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.450> tips<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.990> get<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.170> little<00:04:45.380> bit

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
then touch the tips to get a little bit

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.620 
then touch the tips to get a little bit
of<00:04:45.680> length<00:04:45.920> but<00:04:46.670> it<00:04:46.910> doesn't<00:04:47.210> clump<00:04:47.390> up

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
of length but it doesn't clump up

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.750 
of length but it doesn't clump up
because<00:04:47.990> we<00:04:48.140> worked<00:04:48.410> all<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.980> into<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.400> base

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
because we worked all that into the base

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.390 
because we worked all that into the base
of<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.090> lashes<00:04:50.300> first<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.530> then<00:04:51.830> just<00:04:52.100> apply

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
of the lashes first and then just apply

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.720
