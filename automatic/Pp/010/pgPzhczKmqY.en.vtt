00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.140
I can clean ma room if I try, sweep sweep
brush, sweep sweep brush I don't think so.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.090
Pop sees my room and he is so horrified
He cannot believe that I live in this grime.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:46.370
Sometimes I cringe, then I kick my stuff aside
Will deal with it another time.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:56.629
You say it's bad but you do not really know
That my confidence only continues to grow

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.150
Other's judgment really is my only foe
Let's be real this ain't a chateau.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.990
(Sweep, Sweep, Brush...)

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:32.300
(Vroom Vroom Vroom like a vacuum x repeated)
My friends are everywhere, free moments are

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.300
so spare.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:45.010
We want to go have fun.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:55.750
I don't have time, being dirty's not a crime.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.610
I'm a busy girl.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.049
You see dust but you don't have any trust,
I'm gonna make it in this world.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.049
There is so much life going on, can't clean
our rooms.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.049
My dreams will come true.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.049
I'll have success, even in this mess.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.049
Closet's cluttered, but I'm not filled with
dread

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.049
You think I care?

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.049
Well then you were mislead
We are young girls, (spoken) yeah we've got

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.049
some gangsta cred
Don't make your bed, live life instead.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.049
(Ah!

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.049
Crumbs...)

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.049
It's my space, not a disaster- don't think
that you're my master.

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:31.690
A free spirit, don't ya hear it? your inner
voice says not to quit.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:45.459
So join me, and feel free to have all your
own priorities.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:55.790
Liberated, rejuvenated, the future is for
us to seize!

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.830
(Come come come and clean ma room).

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:26.690
(Come come come and clean ma room) I can clean
ma room if I try, sweep sweep brush, sweep

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:40.150
sweep brush I don' t think so.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:56.099
(Come come come and clean ma room) I can clean
ma room if I try, sweep sweep brush, sweep

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.519
sweep brush I don' t think so.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.180
I can clean my room if I try, (all) sweep
sweep brush, sweep sweep brush I don't think

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.390
so.
