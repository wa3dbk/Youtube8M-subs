00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.890 
stone was carving and I work in clay
usually<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:17.099> terracotta<00:02:17.999> but<00:02:18.389> once<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
while for casting and resin the way I do

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.030 
while for casting and resin the way I do
stone<00:02:22.650> carving<00:02:23.249> is<00:02:23.689> often<00:02:24.689> that<00:02:25.109> I<00:02:25.439> will<00:02:25.829> see<00:02:26.010> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
stone carving is often that I will see a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.949 
stone carving is often that I will see a
piece<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.370> stone<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.299> I'll<00:02:27.420> think<00:02:27.719> well<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
piece of stone and I'll think well I

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.319 
piece of stone and I'll think well I
think<00:02:28.079> I'll<00:02:28.379> carve<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:29.010> off<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.609> I<00:02:30.090> see

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
think I'll carve that off and I see

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.240 
think I'll carve that off and I see
where<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.719> leads<00:02:31.019> me<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.799> leads<00:02:32.099> me

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
where that leads me and it leads me

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.199 
where that leads me and it leads me
slowly<00:02:32.730> into<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.780> carving<00:02:34.469> itself<00:02:34.859> and<00:02:35.209> each

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
slowly into the carving itself and each

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.990 
slowly into the carving itself and each
stone<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.200> carve<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.889> different<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.939> you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
stone you carve is different and so you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.559 
stone you carve is different and so you
may<00:02:39.510> carve<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.109> slightly<00:02:40.409> differently<00:02:41.569> it's

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
may carve it slightly differently it's

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.720 
may carve it slightly differently it's
not<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.019> much<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.409> challenge<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
not so much the challenge of the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.179 
not so much the challenge of the
material<00:02:45.419> as<00:02:45.629> it<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.169> challenge<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.950> being

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
material as it is the challenge of being

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.020 
material as it is the challenge of being
able<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:49.040> project<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.189> material<00:02:50.730> into<00:02:51.000> space

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
able to project the material into space

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.939 
able to project the material into space
in<00:02:51.719> some<00:02:52.019> way<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:53.189> enjoy<00:02:54.530> people<00:02:55.530> looking

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:55.949 
in some way that I enjoy people looking

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.159 
in some way that I enjoy people looking
at<00:02:56.069> my<00:02:56.219> work<00:02:56.430> often<00:02:57.000> say<00:02:57.239> it's<00:02:57.449> influenced<00:02:58.049> by

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
at my work often say it's influenced by

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.199 
at my work often say it's influenced by
pre-columbian<00:02:59.040> art<00:02:59.219> but<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.760> isn't

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
pre-columbian art but it isn't

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.569 
pre-columbian art but it isn't
particularly<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.680> only<00:03:01.919> very<00:03:02.340> recently

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
particularly I it's only very recently

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.670 
particularly I it's only very recently
that<00:03:03.030> I've<00:03:03.480> started<00:03:03.840> seeing<00:03:04.290> much<00:03:04.650> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
that I've started seeing much of

that I've started seeing much of
pre-columbian<00:03:05.639> art<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.150> think<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.230> strongest

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
pre-columbian art I think the strongest

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.990 
pre-columbian art I think the strongest
influence<00:03:08.099> on<00:03:08.639> me<00:03:08.879> was<00:03:09.060> Donatello<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:11.069> 15th

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
influence on me was Donatello the 15th

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.449 
influence on me was Donatello the 15th
century<00:03:12.469> Florentine<00:03:13.469> sculptor<00:03:13.709> although

century Florentine sculptor although

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.360 
century Florentine sculptor although
Rodin<00:03:15.000> was<00:03:15.329> also<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> fairly<00:03:16.379> strong<00:03:16.709> influence

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
Rodin was also a fairly strong influence

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.599 
Rodin was also a fairly strong influence
on<00:03:17.519> me<00:03:17.759> while<00:03:17.939> I<00:03:17.970> was<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.299> art<00:03:18.629> school<00:03:19.280> later<00:03:20.280> on

on me while I was in art school later on

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.270 
on me while I was in art school later on
in<00:03:21.030> Rome<00:03:21.329> Bernini<00:03:22.019> became<00:03:22.590> an<00:03:22.769> important

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
in Rome Bernini became an important

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.939 
in Rome Bernini became an important
influence<00:03:23.900> when<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.199> have<00:03:25.379> trouble<00:03:25.709> with

influence when I would have trouble with
a<00:03:25.979> marble<00:03:26.489> carving<00:03:26.909> I<00:03:27.030> would<00:03:27.180> go<00:03:27.359> over<00:03:27.389> to<00:03:27.509> the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
a marble carving I would go over to the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.379 
a marble carving I would go over to the

things like that I was commissioned in

things like that I was commissioned in
the<00:03:48.479> early<00:03:48.900> 70s<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.829> design<00:03:50.220> eleven<00:03:50.729> gargoyles

although I did monsters even before that
monster<00:03:57.719> seems<00:03:58.409> to<00:03:58.620> me<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:59.069> wonderful<00:03:59.519> way<00:04:00.000> of

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
monster seems to me a wonderful way of

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.729 
monster seems to me a wonderful way of
combining<00:04:00.979> the<00:04:01.979> abstract<00:04:03.469> with<00:04:04.469> the

combining the abstract with the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.949 
combining the abstract with the
realistic<00:04:05.219> in<00:04:05.729> a<00:04:05.819> funny<00:04:06.090> way<00:04:06.389> because<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
realistic in a funny way because a

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.199 
realistic in a funny way because a
monster<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.769> have<00:04:08.009> two<00:04:08.250> noses<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.789> three

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
monster can have two noses and three

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.009 
monster can have two noses and three
mouths<00:04:09.509> and<00:04:09.959> yet<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.709> still<00:04:10.979> see<00:04:11.280> what<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.639> is

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
mouths and yet you still see what it is

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.559 
mouths and yet you still see what it is
whereas<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.049> pure<00:04:13.439> abstraction<00:04:14.039> you<00:04:14.819> have<00:04:15.419> to

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
whereas a pure abstraction you have to

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.140 
whereas a pure abstraction you have to
enjoy<00:04:15.900> just<00:04:16.169> for<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.530> quality<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.340> form<00:04:17.699> I

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
enjoy just for the quality of the form I

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.110 
enjoy just for the quality of the form I
think<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.469> biggest<00:04:19.769> single<00:04:20.250> carving<00:04:20.969> I've

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
think the biggest single carving I've

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.580 
think the biggest single carving I've
ever

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
ever
