00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:07.790

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.530
 very , very interesting deserved knife 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.110
 I think you guessed it at all 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.570
 with those fond of knives can't but 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:30.160
 know don't recognize this knife 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 This is of course a scout's knife 43 years 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.280
 was called nothing but cherry 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.200
 characteristic of such a greenish color 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.940
 stick let's marvelous 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.270
 let's see I really don't know who the guys are 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.880
 made this cue 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.770
 here but very very thorough here 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.110
 everything 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:02.300
 repeated but there is still a little bit 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.500
 I'll tell you about the story multiply by 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.079
 art field 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.979
 invite you to enjoy a look at 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:14.289
 this knife blade at least this 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.249
 Fedot workshop 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:22.310
 make you h12mf there is a wedge shape 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:25.029
 aged like the original don't know what 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 there on the thickness of the blade but 

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:32.719
 that is, a pen from where you can from this 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.630
 guys i cant say for sure i 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:40.880
 take an interest to own entered sharpened 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.499
 I have a suspicion that this is sort of 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.349
 not Russian bulat need 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:51.069
 Well , something is very similar to what it is. 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:54.349
 may be the original warehouse some 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.860
 the only thing I put on it is another 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:00.340
 kreen that is 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.190
 This here is my opinion very-very all on 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 this indicates and put a wedge out of more 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.490
 decent steel legs in general 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.850
 Noteworthy knife is interesting as 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:19.480
 as if the combat knife was originally, that is, I 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:24.340
 replaced by nr fortieth many 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 know this inner 40 as Finnish nkvd with 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 there are a few differences there still 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.700
 penal battalion, and so on that it is the same 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 the modern name of the same Zlatoust 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.310
 talk to you soon about those 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.140
 knives finebaty Zlatoust 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.080
 replicas that is here he came 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 rethinking was by engineers was 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.350
 designed a similar knife actually then 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.930
 I have enough hands 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.840
 held these important original and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.810
 replicas can say what exactly is cherry 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.810
 as if considering fully justified 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.160
 Reasonable than valny let's say so legs 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.250
 really to more combat use 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:18.400
 for fighting live weight opponent say 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:23.670
 so yeah well, just as a fighter while sales 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.190
 again, that is, in everyday life is quite applicable 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.590
 he is not working well proud 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.239
 present at performance here 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.630
 no complaints again guys get old 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.049
 I do not know who fully production 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.360
 there are also suspicions that this 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.470
 the original entire wedge is already on the water from 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.980
 Fedot workshop 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.980
 I will clarify the owners then be sure 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.640
 in the description of the video will point it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.710
 The construction of the knife is very simple. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.120
 collapsible topside is gadget 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:08.520
 slot you see a plastic handle 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.340
 but put all the handle that is it 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.700
 easily understands cleaned my lubricate 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.130
 somehow and with the breakdown of the same blade 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:24.600
 easy to replace or repair here 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.570
 such a scout if less memory 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.820
 similar in general constructively he 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.900
 is in service to this day by 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.900
 at least listed 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:44.160
 but maybe maybe I do not know someone 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:48.170
 there is a principle as if to my imho that knife 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:54.270
 principle interesting and under its task 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:57.270
 quite gauche and rollers glycidol should 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.880
 satisfy the majority 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.190
 let's say so fighters that this knife 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.420
 put dozens he can be a hilt like 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:10.190
 a little bit short but this is already though I am again 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.190
 my hand is not the biggest 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.790
 But I think that this is exactly 43 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.820
 the cherry knife is there as interesting as possible 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.060
 there are 40 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.090
 how then is he so interesting good 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.440
 a peasant is somehow too much of a pear here 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.170
 43 cherries are just more interesting at first 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.790
 anyone you notice I have here still 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:42.770
 one interesting knife is nothing more than 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.770
 very strong camp 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.840
 here it is of course quite scrap though 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:54.250
 really honest guys tell you this 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:00.100
 that the cap did not fall off 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:02.600
 it says here on the capital ruffle 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.540
 despite the fact that you can be quite large 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.510
 that constructive he just but 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.990
 snotty that is the same cherry as if all 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:15.940
 much more fun to tell you 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.780
 here it's just like toys but common 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.070
 trends 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.680
 I will show the handle here the size of the chest 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:30.010
 visible hang on the night too 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.010
 enough already say so gray hair 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.510
 but coming back 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.090
 the hero of our review was cut into what else 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.460
 just say really cool 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.190
 cool knife cool feints not afraid 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:48.710
 This word Yes, we love to call 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:52.789
 Similar pressure on Fink interesting 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:55.430
 Russian bulat piece misses cue 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.860
 This knife I do not know what quality 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.800
 that the knife can be is of course 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.700
 work pen damask I don't know guys have 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.700
 on except the blade 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.780
 if then from Russian Bulat is quite 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:14.690
 worthy here is absolutely not ashamed 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.750
 you need a completely authentic other 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:21.080
 take an interest guys guys this 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.800
 knife I think it's not some kind of there 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.320
 secret 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.830
 further depiction 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.990
 information will be added 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.630
 the origin of this handsome 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:38.010
 Well that's all I wanted to here stands Paris 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:40.180
 It can not be a little bit messy but 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.870
 really causes positive 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.770
 emotions that is at the same time is not 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.100
 somehow 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:51.610
 reza than rabata when she is a thing with 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.400
 knife history deserves attention in 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:57.450
 full on this all thanks good luck 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.450
 and bye
