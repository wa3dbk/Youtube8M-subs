let me just kind of recap a little bit
what<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> did<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.529> where<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.130> ok<00:00:24.090> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
what I did and where I'm at with it ok I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.330 
what I did and where I'm at with it ok I
have<00:00:24.390> total<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.350> six<00:00:25.619> samples<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.330> poplar<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
have total of six samples on poplar I

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.310 
have total of six samples on poplar I
have<00:00:29.340> two<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> were<00:00:30.000> true<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.019> were<00:00:31.109> oil

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
have two that were true there were oil

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.150 
have two that were true there were oil
with<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> Benjamin<00:00:32.820> Moore<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.210> 17<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
with the Benjamin Moore to 17 and the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.530 
with the Benjamin Moore to 17 and the
Zinser<00:00:35.850> cover<00:00:36.090> stain<00:00:37.280> now<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.579> these<00:00:38.850> two<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
Zinser cover stain now of these two I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
Zinser cover stain now of these two I
thought<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.930> were<00:00:40.020> pretty<00:00:40.170> similar<00:00:40.530> during

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
thought they were pretty similar during

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.110 
thought they were pretty similar during
the<00:00:41.129> application<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.600> leveling<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.820> amount

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the application the leveling the amount

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
the application the leveling the amount
of<00:00:45.379> primer<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> soaked<00:00:47.010> through<00:00:48.559> filling

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
of primer that soaked through filling

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
of primer that soaked through filling
the<00:00:49.950> pores<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> wood<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the pores of the wood they really just

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.040 
the pores of the wood they really just
there's<00:00:52.230> photos<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:53.059> posted<00:00:54.059> online<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.629> they

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
there's photos I posted online but they

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650 
there's photos I posted online but they
really<00:00:55.530> did<00:00:55.680> look<00:00:55.860> identical<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.059> would

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
really did look identical they I would

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
really did look identical they I would
have<00:00:57.870> thought<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.170> were<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.410> product

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
have thought they were the same product

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.439 
have thought they were the same product
so<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> only<00:01:00.090> difference<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:02.059> at<00:01:03.059> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so the only difference is really at this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
so the only difference is really at this
point<00:01:03.570> became<00:01:03.989> exposed<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> sanded<00:01:05.129> them

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
point became exposed when I sanded them

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
point became exposed when I sanded them
so<00:01:05.850> let's<00:01:06.330> take<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.110> what

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so let's take a look at what what

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.500 
so let's take a look at what what
happened<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
happened with that

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.740 
happened with that
okay<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> 217<00:01:10.970> now<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.119> had<00:01:12.299> 24<00:01:12.720> hours

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
okay I'm this 217 now these had 24 hours

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.469 
okay I'm this 217 now these had 24 hours
to<00:01:13.049> dry<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.479> entirely

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to dry and I'm not really entirely

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.719 
to dry and I'm not really entirely
convinced<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.350> were<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:17.130> ready<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
convinced that they were really ready to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.109 
convinced that they were really ready to
be<00:01:18.390> sanded<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:19.080> 24<00:01:19.680> hours<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.909> still

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
be sanded at 24 hours they just still

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.780 
be sanded at 24 hours they just still
had<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> sort<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> soft<00:01:22.350> damp<00:01:23.040> feel<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.640> them

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
had a sort of a soft damp feel to them

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
had a sort of a soft damp feel to them
although<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.500> sand<00:01:25.799> pretty<00:01:26.040> nice<00:01:26.960> let's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
although they did sand pretty nice let's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.609

smooth<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:59.399> only<00:01:59.729> burn<00:01:59.969> through<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> little

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
smooth and I only burn through a little

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.410 
smooth and I only burn through a little
bit<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:01.590> trying<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> work<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.549> brush<00:02:03.149> mark

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
bit here trying to work some brush mark

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.530 
bit here trying to work some brush mark
out<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.790> just<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.909> little<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> corner

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
out and just a little on the corner

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
out and just a little on the corner
which<00:02:06.780> could<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.200> been<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> high<00:02:07.500> spot<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
which could have been a high spot on the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.160 
which could have been a high spot on the
wood<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.489> two<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.150> would<00:02:12.750> think<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
wood so of these two I would think the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
wood so of these two I would think the
cover<00:02:13.349> staying

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
cover staying

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
cover staying
produce<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.310> nicer<00:02:14.610> result<00:02:14.760> with<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.480> coat<00:02:15.660> of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
produce a nicer result with one coat of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.470 
produce a nicer result with one coat of
paint<00:02:15.930> over<00:02:16.140> top<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:18.030> pores<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
paint over top of it the pores of the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.320 
paint over top of it the pores of the
wood<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.810> filled<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.260> both<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:24.060> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
wood are filled on both and I think you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
wood are filled on both and I think you
know<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:24.600> they're<00:02:24.930> they're<00:02:25.890> good<00:02:26.070> for

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
know really they're they're good for

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.220 
know really they're they're good for
paint<00:02:27.110> okay<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.170> let's<00:02:28.470> take<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> look<00:02:28.890> at<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.580> I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
paint okay so let's take a look at the I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.960 
paint okay so let's take a look at the I
get<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.380> X<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.860> am<00:02:32.010> prime<00:02:32.340> start<00:02:32.670> out<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
get this X I am prime start out of the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.850 
get this X I am prime start out of the
way<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.140> didn't<00:02:34.380> go<00:02:34.530> well<00:02:35.010> at<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
way this one didn't go well at all it

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
way this one didn't go well at all it
the<00:02:37.860> entire<00:02:38.100> piece<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.580> full<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.910> these<00:02:39.000> little

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
the entire piece is full of these little

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
the entire piece is full of these little
pockets<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.320> didn't<00:02:41.040> get<00:02:41.130> filled<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
pockets that didn't get filled with the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.520 
pockets that didn't get filled with the
primer<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.570> didn't<00:02:42.810> penetrate<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.350> fill

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
primer it just didn't penetrate and fill

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530 
primer it just didn't penetrate and fill
them<00:02:43.740> their<00:02:44.070> little<00:02:44.220> pores<00:02:44.550> just<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.450> whole

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
them their little pores just the whole

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.220 
them their little pores just the whole
thing<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:45.990> covered<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.800> them<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:48.230> it

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
thing is just covered in them and it

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.050 
thing is just covered in them and it
gummed<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.770> Burnett<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.310> little<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.850> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
gummed up the a Burnett a little bit it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.370 
gummed up the a Burnett a little bit it
wasn't<00:02:51.330> bad<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:53.450> I'm<00:02:54.450> trying<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.720> think<00:02:54.990> I

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
wasn't bad but I'm trying to think I

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.510 
wasn't bad but I'm trying to think I
think<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.650> was<00:02:55.740> around<00:02:55.890> hour<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> half

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
think it was around hour and a half

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.050 
think it was around hour and a half
maybe<00:02:56.730> two<00:02:57.030> hours<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.630> let<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.170> dry<00:02:59.060> so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
maybe two hours that I let it dry so

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.990 
maybe two hours that I let it dry so
this<00:03:00.390> has<00:03:00.570> burned<00:03:00.840> through<00:03:00.990> too<00:03:01.530> much<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this has burned through too much to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.780 
this has burned through too much to
really<00:03:03.390> produce<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:04.110> first<00:03:04.530> coat<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.670> would

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
really produce a first coat that would

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.760 
really produce a first coat that would
look<00:03:05.910> good<00:03:06.120> because<00:03:06.960> what<00:03:07.140> was<00:03:07.410> likely<00:03:07.620> to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
look good because what was likely to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.550 
look good because what was likely to
happen<00:03:07.890> when<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.310> do<00:03:08.460> this<00:03:08.550> fine<00:03:08.790> finish<00:03:09.120> work

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
happen when you do this fine finish work

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.250 
happen when you do this fine finish work
these<00:03:10.560> pores<00:03:11.120> will<00:03:12.120> still<00:03:12.450> show<00:03:12.750> through<00:03:12.990> on

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
these pores will still show through on

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.470 
these pores will still show through on
the<00:03:13.380> first<00:03:13.740> coat<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.670> finish<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.240> drives

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the first coat of finish when it drives

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
the first coat of finish when it drives
so<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> wouldn't<00:03:16.590> say<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:17.010> xim<00:03:17.550> was<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:18.500> an

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
so I wouldn't say that xim was really an

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.280 
so I wouldn't say that xim was really an
option<00:03:19.830> for<00:03:20.130> bare<00:03:20.730> poplar<00:03:21.300> they<00:03:21.720> might<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.080> for

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
option for bare poplar they might be for

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.400 
option for bare poplar they might be for
other<00:03:22.440> things<00:03:22.739> okay<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.840> moving<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.170> kills

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
other things okay so moving on to kills

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.850 
other things okay so moving on to kills
max<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.390> went<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.200> nice<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.709> was

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
max this one went on really nice it was

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.940 
max this one went on really nice it was
very<00:03:29.070> nice<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.459> work<00:03:29.489> with<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:30.200> leveled<00:03:31.200> really

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
very nice to work with it leveled really

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.830 
very nice to work with it leveled really
fast<00:03:32.220> probably<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> quickest<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.570> all<00:03:33.720> of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
fast probably the quickest of all of

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.510 
fast probably the quickest of all of
these<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:36.239> has<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> nice<00:03:36.750> solid<00:03:37.170> feel<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:38.340> it

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
these and it has a nice solid feel to it

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.199 
these and it has a nice solid feel to it
this<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.300> does<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:39.600> some<00:03:40.350> very<00:03:40.590> faint

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
this one does have some very faint

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.820 
this one does have some very faint
pockets<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.450> didn't<00:03:42.750> quite<00:03:42.870> get<00:03:43.140> full<00:03:43.530> and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
pockets that didn't quite get full and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.960 
pockets that didn't quite get full and
flush<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:46.709> nothing<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.280> really<00:03:47.489> worry<00:03:47.880> about

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
flush it's nothing to really worry about

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.090 
flush it's nothing to really worry about
I<00:03:48.180> mean<00:03:48.570> if<00:03:48.720> you're<00:03:48.870> doing<00:03:49.020> one<00:03:49.530> prime<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:49.800> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
I mean if you're doing one prime and to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.920 
I mean if you're doing one prime and to
finish<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.610> will<00:03:50.820> certainly<00:03:51.180> work<00:03:51.450> really

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
finish this will certainly work really

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.160 
finish this will certainly work really
good<00:03:52.489> but<00:03:53.489> these<00:03:54.000> little<00:03:54.180> pockets<00:03:54.720> are<00:03:54.840> likely

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
good but these little pockets are likely

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.990 
good but these little pockets are likely
to<00:03:55.350> be<00:03:55.530> seen<00:03:55.830> through<00:03:56.100> your<00:03:56.220> first<00:03:56.400> coat<00:03:58.970> okay

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
when I'm really nice it was actually

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.870 
when I'm really nice it was actually

I<00:04:16.430> burned<00:04:17.430> up<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.760> little<00:04:18.030> bit<00:04:18.239> just<00:04:18.450> trying<00:04:18.630> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
I burned up a little bit just trying to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.210 
I burned up a little bit just trying to
get<00:04:18.810> rid<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> some<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.350> brush<00:04:19.530> marks<00:04:19.919> of

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
get rid of some of the brush marks of

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.250 
get rid of some of the brush marks of
all<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.700> these<00:04:20.820> samples<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.840> one<00:04:22.049> had<00:04:22.229> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
all of these samples this one had the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.570 
all of these samples this one had the
worst<00:04:22.740> brush<00:04:23.310> marks<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.890> took<00:04:26.370> some

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
worst brush marks and it took some

really<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.170> little<00:04:28.440> probably<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:29.250> longest

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
really a little probably the longest

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.500 
really a little probably the longest
maybe<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.680> all<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:32.070> them<00:04:32.190> close<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> X<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.360> am

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
maybe of all of them close to the X I am

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.440 
maybe of all of them close to the X I am
it<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.990> didn't<00:04:34.290> sound<00:04:34.440> good<00:04:34.710> at<00:04:34.950> all<00:04:35.450> you

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
it just didn't sound good at all you

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.680 
it just didn't sound good at all you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.200 
know to do it quick get rid of brush
marks<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.100> surface<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.610> smooth<00:04:41.910> it's

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
marks so the surface is smooth it's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.650 
marks so the surface is smooth it's
entirely<00:04:43.110> ready<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.620> paint

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
entirely ready for paint

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.660

feel<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.690> little<00:04:45.870> bit<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.190> slight<00:04:47.190> sheen<00:04:47.430> to

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
feel a little bit of a slight sheen to

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.320 
feel a little bit of a slight sheen to
it<00:04:48.920> okay<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:50.040> then<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> last<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.700> was<00:04:51.090> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
it okay and then the last one was the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.710 
it okay and then the last one was the
mystery<00:04:52.080> product<00:04:52.910> like<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.000> say<00:04:54.240> what<00:04:54.390> this<00:04:54.540> is

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
mystery product like I say what this is

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.220 
mystery product like I say what this is
yet

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
yet

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.410 
yet
so<00:04:56.190> everything<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.730> all<00:04:56.850> nice<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.270> finished

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
so everything is all nice and finished

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.210 
so everything is all nice and finished
and<00:04:57.870> we'll<00:04:58.470> look<00:04:58.560> at<00:04:58.710> all<00:04:58.830> these<00:04:59.010> samples

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
and we'll look at all these samples

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.030 
and we'll look at all these samples
together<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.970> then<00:05:00.480> you<00:05:00.720> could<00:05:00.900> probably

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
together and then you could probably

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.080 
together and then you could probably
maybe<00:05:02.040> just<00:05:02.280> pick<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.640> one<00:05:02.790> that<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.060> think

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
maybe just pick the one that you think

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.520 
maybe just pick the one that you think
looks<00:05:03.420> the<00:05:03.540> best<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:07.140> nice<00:05:07.290> thing<00:05:07.470> about

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
looks the best and the nice thing about

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.830 
looks the best and the nice thing about
this<00:05:07.890> product<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.460> it's<00:05:08.700> very<00:05:08.760> difficult<00:05:09.480> to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
this product is it's very difficult to

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.480 
this product is it's very difficult to
burn<00:05:10.470> through<00:05:10.770> with<00:05:11.520> 240<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.210> Burnett<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:13.740> the

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
burn through with 240 a Burnett it the

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.040 
burn through with 240 a Burnett it the
other<00:05:14.610> thing<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.000> other<00:05:15.030> advantage<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.780> when

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
other thing the other advantage is when

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.780 
other thing the other advantage is when
you<00:05:16.200> apply<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:16.830> levels<00:05:17.160> itself<00:05:17.580> off<00:05:17.760> so

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
you apply it it levels itself off so

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.060 
you apply it it levels itself off so
there<00:05:18.150> are<00:05:18.240> no<00:05:18.420> brush<00:05:18.660> marks<00:05:19.080> you<00:05:19.710> might<00:05:19.890> not

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
there are no brush marks you might not

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.340 
there are no brush marks you might not
look<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.280> prettiest<00:05:20.820> when<00:05:21.060> it's<00:05:21.240> dry<00:05:21.510> of<00:05:21.780> all

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
look the prettiest when it's dry of all

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.230 
look the prettiest when it's dry of all
of<00:05:22.500> these<00:05:22.650> because<00:05:23.580> so<00:05:23.790> much<00:05:23.910> of<00:05:23.970> it

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
of these because so much of it

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.170 
of these because so much of it
penetrates<00:05:24.810> this<00:05:25.110> wood<00:05:25.610> but<00:05:26.610> what<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.850> does<00:05:27.000> is

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
penetrates this wood but what it does is

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.060 
penetrates this wood but what it does is
it<00:05:27.330> fills<00:05:27.600> all<00:05:27.780> these<00:05:27.960> little<00:05:28.080> pockets<00:05:28.620> really

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
it fills all these little pockets really

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.520 
it fills all these little pockets really
nice<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:30.570> fact<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:31.230> durable

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
nice and the fact that it is so durable

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.280 
nice and the fact that it is so durable
it's<00:05:32.460> very<00:05:32.790> difficult<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.420> burn<00:05:33.600> back<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:33.930> bare

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
it's very difficult to burn back to bare

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.810 
it's very difficult to burn back to bare
wood<00:05:34.500> we're<00:05:34.950> on<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.670> 17<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:38.490> could<00:05:38.670> burn

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
wood we're on to 17 you could burn

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.250 
wood we're on to 17 you could burn
through<00:05:39.060> this<00:05:39.180> too<00:05:39.390> so<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:39.720> can<00:05:39.750> take<00:05:40.110> this

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
through this too so you can take this

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.640 
through this too so you can take this
217<00:05:41.040> clear<00:05:41.280> off<00:05:41.460> with<00:05:41.700> 240<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.900> are<00:05:43.169> super<00:05:43.620> easy

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
217 clear off with 240 it are super easy

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.450 
217 clear off with 240 it are super easy
in<00:05:44.130> comparison<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:47.070> know<00:05:47.250> that's

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
in comparison to this so you know that's

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.670 
in comparison to this so you know that's
not<00:05:47.640> necessarily<00:05:47.700> in<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:48.840> your<00:05:48.960> advantage<00:05:49.320> you

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
not necessarily in to your advantage you

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.320 
not necessarily in to your advantage you
know<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:49.980> could<00:05:50.160> burning<00:05:51.030> through<00:05:51.210> your

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
know that could burning through your

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.120 
know that could burning through your
prime<00:05:51.570> coat<00:05:51.810> could<00:05:52.140> cost<00:05:52.380> you<00:05:52.650> more<00:05:52.680> in<00:05:52.950> the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
prime coat could cost you more in the

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.130 
prime coat could cost you more in the
long<00:05:53.220> run<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:53.820> you<00:05:54.150> want<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:54.750> be<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:54.930> nice

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
long run so you want it to be a nice

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.860 
long run so you want it to be a nice
solid<00:05:55.560> finish<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:56.550> here<00:05:56.880> cover<00:05:57.510> stain

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
solid finish this here cover stain

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.920 
solid finish this here cover stain
actually<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:59.070> probably<00:05:59.820> the<00:06:00.000> closest<00:06:00.480> to<00:06:00.630> this

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
actually is probably the closest to this

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.470 
actually is probably the closest to this
product<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.560> feel<00:06:02.550> they<00:06:02.760> both<00:06:02.970> feel<00:06:03.270> like<00:06:03.300> a

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
product and feel they both feel like a

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.950 
product and feel they both feel like a
Formica<00:06:04.190> type<00:06:05.190> finish<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.090> these<00:06:06.630> are<00:06:06.810> the

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
Formica type finish and these are the

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.010 
Formica type finish and these are the
most<00:06:07.410> solid<00:06:07.950> of<00:06:08.040> all<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.310> samples<00:06:08.870> so<00:06:09.870> there's

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
most solid of all the samples so there's

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.680 
most solid of all the samples so there's
no<00:06:10.140> question<00:06:10.590> in<00:06:10.710> my<00:06:10.740> mind<00:06:11.180> especially<00:06:12.180> having

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
painted done this many times these two

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.620 
painted done this many times these two
will<00:06:14.940> look<00:06:15.090> awesome<00:06:15.330> when<00:06:15.660> they're<00:06:15.840> finished

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630

kills Max and Oh 46 so I have yet to see
what<00:06:30.390> these<00:06:30.540> products<00:06:30.990> will<00:06:31.169> do<00:06:31.320> once<00:06:31.620> they're

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
what these products will do once they're

what these products will do once they're
painted<00:06:32.250> I'm<00:06:32.970> not<00:06:33.180> sure<00:06:33.300> when<00:06:33.480> but<00:06:33.810> I'll<00:06:34.110> put

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
painted I'm not sure when but I'll put

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.150 
painted I'm not sure when but I'll put
on<00:06:34.440> them<00:06:34.620> probably<00:06:35.070> premium<00:06:35.640> plus<00:06:36.860> is<00:06:37.860> a<00:06:37.919> good

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
on them probably premium plus is a good

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.809 
on them probably premium plus is a good
leveling<00:06:38.610> product

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
leveling product

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.520 
leveling product
we'll<00:06:40.819> take<00:06:40.970> a<00:06:41.030> look<00:06:41.210> at<00:06:41.300> that<00:06:41.449> and<00:06:41.690> then<00:06:42.319> also

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
we'll take a look at that and then also

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.189 
we'll take a look at that and then also
what<00:06:43.280> I<00:06:43.310> have<00:06:43.550> is<00:06:43.879> I<00:06:44.180> have<00:06:44.270> this<00:06:44.720> I<00:06:44.930> made<00:06:45.080> this

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
what I have is I have this I made this

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.089 
what I have is I have this I made this
little<00:06:45.379> jig<00:06:47.590> basically<00:06:48.590> it's<00:06:48.740> going<00:06:48.860> to<00:06:48.919> work

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
little jig basically it's going to work

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.710 
little jig basically it's going to work
like<00:06:50.259> I'll<00:06:51.259> set<00:06:51.500> a<00:06:51.530> predetermined<00:06:52.250> height<00:06:52.720> of

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
like I'll set a predetermined height of

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.710 
like I'll set a predetermined height of
probably<00:06:54.139> about<00:06:54.319> six<00:06:54.770> inches<00:06:55.159> and<00:06:55.729> I<00:06:56.000> have<00:06:56.150> a<00:06:56.210> I

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
probably about six inches and I have a I

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.809 
probably about six inches and I have a I
think<00:06:57.470> it's<00:06:57.620> a<00:06:57.710> 3/8<00:06:58.250> inch<00:06:59.110> aluminum<00:07:00.110> pipe<00:07:00.819> it's

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
think it's a 3/8 inch aluminum pipe it's

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.180 
think it's a 3/8 inch aluminum pipe it's
got<00:07:01.970> some<00:07:02.120> nice<00:07:02.500> it's<00:07:03.500> got<00:07:03.650> some<00:07:03.800> nice<00:07:03.949> weight

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
got some nice it's got some nice weight

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.249 
got some nice it's got some nice weight
to<00:07:04.220> it<00:07:04.580> and<00:07:04.610> this<00:07:04.909> edge<00:07:05.090> here<00:07:05.120> is<00:07:05.479> extremely

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
to it and this edge here is extremely

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.830 
to it and this edge here is extremely
sharp<00:07:06.470> and<00:07:07.090> what<00:07:08.090> I'm<00:07:08.180> going<00:07:08.300> to<00:07:08.330> do<00:07:08.449> is<00:07:08.629> I'm

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
sharp and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.080 
sharp and what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:07:08.930> to<00:07:08.990> allow<00:07:09.259> this<00:07:09.500> to<00:07:09.710> just<00:07:10.220> pivot<00:07:10.970> and

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
going to allow this to just pivot and

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.339 
going to allow this to just pivot and
fall<00:07:11.720> like<00:07:12.050> this<00:07:12.949> onto<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:13.610> surface<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:14.349> then

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:15.349 
fall like this onto the surface and then

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.149 
fall like this onto the surface and then
we're<00:07:15.500> going<00:07:15.590> to<00:07:15.680> see<00:07:15.889> if<00:07:16.069> any<00:07:16.250> of<00:07:16.340> these

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
we're going to see if any of these

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:24.520 
we're going to see if any of these
surfaces<00:07:19.330> dent<00:07:20.330> at<00:07:20.630> all<00:07:21.050> by<00:07:21.740> doing<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:23.530> just

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
surfaces dent at all by doing that just

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.610 
surfaces dent at all by doing that just
check<00:07:24.740> for<00:07:24.949> some<00:07:25.159> durability<00:07:26.289> ok<00:07:27.289> so<00:07:27.349> that's

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
check for some durability ok so that's

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.520 
check for some durability ok so that's
probably<00:07:27.860> it<00:07:28.220> for<00:07:28.490> now<00:07:28.639> and<00:07:29.259> when<00:07:30.259> I<00:07:30.289> get<00:07:30.440> these

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530 
probably it for now and when I get these

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.950 
probably it for now and when I get these
finished<00:07:30.949> I'll<00:07:31.819> post<00:07:32.060> photos<00:07:32.360> of<00:07:32.509> each<00:07:32.780> of

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
finished I'll post photos of each of

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.600 
finished I'll post photos of each of
them<00:07:33.139> and<00:07:33.169> we'll<00:07:33.800> just<00:07:33.949> take<00:07:34.069> a<00:07:34.099> look<00:07:34.310> at<00:07:34.400> see

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610 
them and we'll just take a look at see

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.449 
them and we'll just take a look at see
which<00:07:34.759> one<00:07:34.940> looks<00:07:34.969> the<00:07:35.270> best
