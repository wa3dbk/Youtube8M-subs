this is the latest in innovation from

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.710 
this is the latest in innovation from
Germany<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.170> BMW<00:00:16.949> i3<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:18.300> company's

Germany this is the BMW i3 the company's

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.439 
Germany this is the BMW i3 the company's
first<00:00:18.990> production<00:00:19.939> all-electric<00:00:20.939> vehicle

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
first production all-electric vehicle

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.259 
first production all-electric vehicle
now<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.859> prettiest<00:00:23.430> car<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.939> BMW

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
now it's not the prettiest car that BMW

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.660 
now it's not the prettiest car that BMW
has<00:00:24.810> ever<00:00:25.019> built<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> looks<00:00:26.430> don't

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
has ever built but if the looks don't

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.650 
has ever built but if the looks don't
grow<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.689> driving<00:00:28.140> experience<00:00:28.260> will

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.780 

now<00:00:35.660> like<00:00:35.870> any<00:00:36.050> electric<00:00:36.500> car<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:36.890> quiet<00:00:37.490> in

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
now like any electric car it's quiet in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.430 
now like any electric car it's quiet in
here<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:38.090> course<00:00:38.270> there's<00:00:38.570> no<00:00:38.720> engine<00:00:38.930> making

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
here of course there's no engine making

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.350 
here of course there's no engine making
any<00:00:39.560> noise<00:00:39.830> you<00:00:40.100> just<00:00:40.400> get<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.940> road<00:00:41.120> noise

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
any noise you just get the road noise

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.870 
any noise you just get the road noise
from<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.050> tires<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.770> from<00:00:43.130> vehicles<00:00:43.580> around

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
from the tires and from vehicles around

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.090 
from the tires and from vehicles around
you<00:00:44.120> wind<00:00:44.390> noise<00:00:44.570> if<00:00:44.810> there<00:00:45.020> is<00:00:45.140> any<00:00:45.380> these

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
you wind noise if there is any these

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.740 
you wind noise if there is any these
vehicles<00:00:46.400> are<00:00:46.700> all<00:00:46.850> about<00:00:47.150> weight<00:00:47.480> they<00:00:47.720> have

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
vehicles are all about weight they have

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.650 
vehicles are all about weight they have
to<00:00:48.200> be<00:00:48.320> lightweight<00:00:48.620> because<00:00:49.340> weight<00:00:49.910> cuts

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
to be lightweight because weight cuts

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.810 
to be lightweight because weight cuts
into<00:00:50.930> your<00:00:50.960> battery<00:00:51.410> range<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.310> we're<00:00:52.580> driving

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
into your battery range so we're driving

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.850 
into your battery range so we're driving
a<00:00:53.150> vehicle<00:00:53.570> that's<00:00:53.720> essentially<00:00:54.350> made<00:00:54.560> out<00:00:54.710> of

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
a vehicle that's essentially made out of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.980 
a vehicle that's essentially made out of
carbon<00:00:55.220> fiber<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.820> aluminum<00:00:55.990> lightweight

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
carbon fiber and aluminum lightweight

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.320 
carbon fiber and aluminum lightweight
materials<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:58.010> okay<00:00:58.700> they're<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:58.940> little<00:00:59.120> bit

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
materials that okay they're a little bit

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.630 
materials that okay they're a little bit
more<00:00:59.360> costly<00:01:00.080> but<00:01:00.860> they<00:01:01.040> make<00:01:01.280> up<00:01:01.310> the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
more costly but they make up the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.700 
more costly but they make up the
difference<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.270> battery<00:01:02.660> if<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.470> car

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
difference in the battery if the car

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.770 
difference in the battery if the car
doesn't<00:01:03.920> weigh<00:01:04.160> as<00:01:04.309> much<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.180> can<00:01:05.360> put<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.690> a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
doesn't weigh as much you can put in a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.570 
doesn't weigh as much you can put in a
smaller<00:01:06.110> battery<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.920> still<00:01:07.250> get<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.460> same

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
smaller battery and still get the same

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.090 
smaller battery and still get the same
amount<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.120> range<00:01:08.360> smaller<00:01:09.050> battery<00:01:09.530> less

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
amount of range smaller battery less

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.150 
amount of range smaller battery less
cost<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.330> all<00:01:11.479> evens<00:01:11.510> out<00:01:11.990> now<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.860> is<00:01:13.040> my

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
cost so it all evens out now this is my

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.370 
cost so it all evens out now this is my
first<00:01:13.400> time<00:01:13.790> behind<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.360> wheel<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.780> an<00:01:14.900> i3

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
first time behind the wheel of an i3

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.170 
first time behind the wheel of an i3
I've<00:01:15.860> driven<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.250> lot<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.490> electric<00:01:16.970> cars

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
I've driven a lot of electric cars

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.000 
I've driven a lot of electric cars
before<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.020> there<00:01:18.380> are<00:01:18.410> some<00:01:18.650> things<00:01:18.830> they

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
before and there are some things they

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.680 
before and there are some things they
all<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.340> in<00:01:19.490> common<00:01:19.520> they<00:01:20.030> all<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> lot

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
all have in common they all have a lot

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.780 
all have in common they all have a lot
of<00:01:20.869> pickup<00:01:21.140> because<00:01:21.710> electric<00:01:22.220> motors<00:01:22.550> make

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
of pickup because electric motors make

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.370 
of pickup because electric motors make
their<00:01:22.940> torque<00:01:23.210> from<00:01:23.390> zero<00:01:23.690> but<00:01:23.869> there<00:01:24.260> are<00:01:24.350> a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
their torque from zero but there are a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.780 
their torque from zero but there are a
few<00:01:24.410> things<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.950> are<00:01:25.070> different<00:01:25.250> on<00:01:25.610> this

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
few things that are different on this

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.969 
few things that are different on this
one<00:01:26.030> for<00:01:26.720> one<00:01:26.869> thing<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.229> steering<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.890> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
one for one thing the steering is a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.700 
one for one thing the steering is a
little<00:01:28.760> more<00:01:29.000> lively<00:01:29.720> than<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:30.020> get<00:01:30.229> on<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.410> lot

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
little more lively than I get on a lot

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.530 
little more lively than I get on a lot
of<00:01:30.860> them<00:01:30.950> but<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.520> biggest<00:01:31.880> thing<00:01:32.300> is<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
of them but the biggest thing is the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.990 
of them but the biggest thing is the
regenerative<00:01:33.229> braking<00:01:34.000> regenerative

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
regenerative braking regenerative

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.120 
regenerative braking regenerative
braking<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.750> way<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.200> car<00:01:36.470> uses

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
braking is the way that the car uses

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.430 
braking is the way that the car uses
kinetic<00:01:37.550> energy<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.240> put<00:01:38.450> power<00:01:38.810> back<00:01:39.200> into

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440

kinetic energy to put power back into
the<00:01:39.560> battery<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.119> car<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:42.220> not

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
the battery and on this car it's not

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.760 
the battery and on this car it's not
very<00:01:43.550> subtle<00:01:43.990> when<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.110> take<00:01:45.320> your<00:01:45.500> foot<00:01:45.710> off

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
very subtle when you take your foot off

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.040 
very subtle when you take your foot off
it's<00:01:46.220> almost<00:01:46.700> like<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.000> come<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> stop<00:01:47.720> and

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
it's almost like you come to a stop and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.469 
it's almost like you come to a stop and
you<00:01:48.470> really<00:01:48.890> have<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.340> learn<00:01:49.820> how<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.149> drive

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
you really have to learn how to drive

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.510 
you really have to learn how to drive
this<00:01:50.750> car<00:01:51.020> I'm<00:01:51.229> always<00:01:51.560> taking<00:01:52.100> my<00:01:52.220> foot<00:01:52.460> off

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
this car I'm always taking my foot off

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.180 
this car I'm always taking my foot off
sooner<00:01:53.119> than<00:01:53.300> I<00:01:53.420> should<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.929> really<00:01:54.830> once<00:01:55.070> you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
sooner than I should and really once you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.040 
sooner than I should and really once you
get<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.490> hang<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.600> drive<00:01:56.869> this

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
get the hang of it you can drive this

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.779 
get the hang of it you can drive this
thing<00:01:57.110> almost<00:01:57.530> without<00:01:57.979> touching<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.580> brake

what they were going for they've pretty
much<00:04:14.850> nailed<00:04:15.240> that<00:04:15.830> now<00:04:16.830> right<00:04:17.070> now<00:04:17.250> I'm<00:04:17.519> stuck

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
much nailed that now right now I'm stuck

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.360 
much nailed that now right now I'm stuck
in<00:04:18.090> traffic<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.750> that's<00:04:19.320> exactly<00:04:19.980> where<00:04:20.160> this

in traffic and that's exactly where this
car<00:04:20.670> really<00:04:21.510> shines<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.650> kind<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.950> people<00:04:23.220> who

movies this is your city commuter and
that's<00:04:35.100> exactly<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.060> kind<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.419> market<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
that's exactly the kind of market that

that's exactly the kind of market that
it's<00:04:37.110> going<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.410> hit<00:04:37.760> now<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> electric

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
it's going to hit now with the electric

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.270 
it's going to hit now with the electric
vehicle<00:04:39.840> market<00:04:40.050> being<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.650> small<00:04:41.070> you'd

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
vehicle market being so small you'd

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.620 
vehicle market being so small you'd
think<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.640> they<00:04:41.730> were<00:04:41.790> all<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.150> same<00:04:42.390> but

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
think that they were all the same but

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.570 
think that they were all the same but
there's<00:04:42.810> actually<00:04:42.960> some<00:04:43.200> pretty<00:04:43.740> significant

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
there's actually some pretty significant

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.310 
there's actually some pretty significant
differences<00:04:45.030> between<00:04:45.090> them<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.750> none<00:04:46.290> of

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
differences between them and none of

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.130 
differences between them and none of
them<00:04:46.590> feel<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:48.270> Tesla<00:04:48.660> Model<00:04:48.690> S

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
them feel like this the Tesla Model S

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.930 
them feel like this the Tesla Model S
well<00:04:49.440> it's<00:04:49.590> more<00:04:49.830> about<00:04:50.040> performance<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.820> raw

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
well it's more about performance and raw

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.810 
well it's more about performance and raw
power<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:51.960> mean<00:04:52.470> from<00:04:52.740> Mitsubishi<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.580> the

Nissan Leaf they're good cars but they

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.560 
Nissan Leaf they're good cars but they

the premium feel and that fuel saving
economy<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.020> get<00:05:04.169> with<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.410> electric

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
economy that you get with the electric

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.860 
economy that you get with the electric
motor<00:05:04.980> but<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.910> really<00:05:06.270> got<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.510> look<00:05:06.600> at<00:05:06.750> all

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870

motor but you really got to look at all
the<00:05:07.020> different<00:05:07.350> factors<00:05:07.530> before<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.340> decide

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
the different factors before you decide

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.240 
the different factors before you decide
if<00:05:08.850> an<00:05:08.940> electric<00:05:09.360> vehicle<00:05:09.480> is<00:05:09.870> right<00:05:10.050> for<00:05:10.320> you

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
if an electric vehicle is right for you

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
if it is I really like this one now

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.460 
if it is I really like this one now
going<00:05:15.210> green<00:05:15.420> means<00:05:15.690> more<00:05:15.930> than<00:05:15.960> just<00:05:16.140> putting

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
going green means more than just putting

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.650 
going green means more than just putting
a<00:05:16.590> battery<00:05:16.770> underneath<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.550> floor<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.030> BMW

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
a battery underneath the floor and BMW

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.510 
a battery underneath the floor and BMW
says<00:05:18.870> that<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.140> i3<00:05:19.530> is<00:05:19.650> sustainable<00:05:20.280> through

says that the i3 is sustainable through

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520 
says that the i3 is sustainable through
and<00:05:20.670> through<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.120> you've<00:05:21.540> got<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> carbon-fiber

it's not just enough to not have

unlike anything I've ever seen in a BMW
in<00:05:52.260> fact<00:05:52.500> it's<00:05:52.710> unlike<00:05:53.310> anything<00:05:53.580> I've<00:05:53.940> ever

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
in fact it's unlike anything I've ever

we have the stand-up screens which make

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.420 
we have the stand-up screens which make
them<00:05:58.290> easy<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.710> see<00:05:58.950> I<00:06:00.050> think<00:06:01.050> this<00:06:01.230> is<00:06:01.440> cool<00:06:01.710> at

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
them easy to see I think this is cool at

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.790 
them easy to see I think this is cool at
our<00:06:02.850> glovebox<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.690> because<00:06:04.530> there's<00:06:04.740> no

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
our glovebox and because there's no

our glovebox and because there's no
driveline<00:06:05.460> tunnel<00:06:05.880> it's<00:06:06.270> a<00:06:06.390> flat<00:06:06.630> floor<00:06:06.960> so

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
driveline tunnel it's a flat floor so

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.630 
driveline tunnel it's a flat floor so
there's<00:06:07.410> a<00:06:07.470> place<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.860> put<00:06:08.010> your<00:06:08.040> pack<00:06:08.340> put

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640

reach it quite easily

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.159 
reach it quite easily
now<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.120> shifter<00:06:12.540> is<00:06:12.600> unlike<00:06:12.930> anything

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
now the shifter is unlike anything

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.560 
now the shifter is unlike anything
you've<00:06:13.440> ever<00:06:13.500> seen<00:06:13.850> first<00:06:14.850> of<00:06:14.970> all<00:06:15.090> that's<00:06:15.330> how

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
you've ever seen first of all that's how

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.320 
you've ever seen first of all that's how
you<00:06:15.630> start<00:06:16.110> it<00:06:16.290> and<00:06:16.410> secondly<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.790> spin<00:06:18.120> this

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
you start it and secondly you spin this

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.300 
you start it and secondly you spin this
to<00:06:18.540> get<00:06:18.690> into<00:06:18.900> driver<00:06:19.169> reverse<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.890> has<00:06:20.040> a<00:06:20.070> one

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
to get into driver reverse it has a one

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.300 
to get into driver reverse it has a one
speed<00:06:20.520> automatic<00:06:21.360> transmission<00:06:22.130> here's<00:06:23.130> our

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
speed automatic transmission here's our

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.760 
speed automatic transmission here's our
cluster<00:06:23.820> and<00:06:24.000> it<00:06:24.300> shows<00:06:24.510> us<00:06:24.750> our<00:06:24.900> speed<00:06:25.260> how

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
cluster and it shows us our speed how

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.980 
cluster and it shows us our speed how
much<00:06:25.950> range<00:06:26.280> we<00:06:26.520> have<00:06:26.550> left<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.240> whether<00:06:27.780> or

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
much range we have left and whether or

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.560 
much range we have left and whether or
not<00:06:28.080> we're<00:06:28.620> using<00:06:29.010> power<00:06:29.220> or<00:06:29.520> if<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.150> braking

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
not we're using power or if the braking

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.469 
not we're using power or if the braking
is<00:06:30.690> putting<00:06:30.990> power<00:06:31.200> back<00:06:31.290> into<00:06:31.860> the<00:06:31.950> battery

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
is putting power back into the battery

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.030 
is putting power back into the battery
now<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.540> big<00:06:33.780> question<00:06:33.960> is<00:06:34.380> how<00:06:34.590> much<00:06:34.620> does

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
now the big question is how much does

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.950 
now the big question is how much does
all<00:06:35.190> of<00:06:35.250> this<00:06:35.490> technology<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.300> luxury<00:06:36.660> cost

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
all of this technology and luxury cost

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.140 
all of this technology and luxury cost
and<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.680> reality<00:06:38.220> is<00:06:38.250> it's<00:06:38.580> less<00:06:38.790> than<00:06:39.060> I

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
and the reality is it's less than I

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.420 
and the reality is it's less than I
thought<00:06:39.360> it<00:06:39.540> would<00:06:39.660> be<00:06:39.810> forty-four<00:06:40.680> 950

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430
