00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.620
 hi everyone followed by fire tricks 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.160
 online and today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.160
 next trick 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 and now 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.780
 this trick basically serves to 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.670
 confuse and to show off on the court what 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.899
 You can use it alone to confuse 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.399
 the speakers can also combine it 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.410
 with others so that it is much better and 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.149
 confuse even more unlike others 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.050
 tricks that are for pulling pipes or for 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.820
 pass to the opponent 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.800
 the main objective as I said before 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.300
 this trick is to confuse the opponent but 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.890
 that does not mean you can not make it 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.180
 a pipe or pass it because if 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.260
 I confused it well, you combine it with the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.000
 combinations you can always 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.950
 surprise him by pulling on a spout or filled 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.210
 it good what we will do to 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.740
 this trick is the next we step on the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.570
 ball with non-dominant foot sole 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.000
 and we drag it backwards by the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.979
 external part ok with the external part 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.979
 of the dominant foot in this way 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.159
 once we drag it on the side 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.049
 external we place the foot of the dominant 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.299
 in the trajectory of the ball to 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.180
 to receive the ball with the part of the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.979
 instep this way once in this 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.869
 position let's crush the ball 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.220
 towards the inner part you could say 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.020
 also that in the direction of your skin 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.119
 dominant right away that we dragged 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.560
 we hit a little jump and control with the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.090
 external part of the foot not dominant as 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.399
 can see is the posture a little 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.289
 uncomfortable but I'll repeat it again ok 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.909
 now we are backwards reception of the 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.560
 ball there we drag forward 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.810
 we hit the jump and control it with 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.520
 the external part of the non-dominant 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 once in this position we return to 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 hit the ball where it came with the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.500
 external part of the foot not dominant and 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.850
 immediately with the dominant we return to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.679
 tap forward and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.420
 we control and we can combine with 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.530
 any other trick that we want all 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.330
 together it would be something like this I'm going to do 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.860
 slow to see it well we tread with 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.539
 the foot sole of dragged dominant 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.700
 by the external part we control for the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.019
 part of the instep we throw it towards the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.130
 non-dominant foot hitting a jump 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.470
 we control with the external part 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.420
 we go back to throw where it came from and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.890
 finally we hit him a little touch with 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.540
 the dominant foot to forward and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.160
 we control this trick you can do 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.959
 slow or you can do it fast the truth 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.250
 that does not have big changes but good 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.840
 always when he does it fast 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.160
 it seems that it looks a little more but 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.410
 the same will confuse the opponent so much 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.240
 slow as fast is more sometimes I see 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.710
 many combinations that are made to 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.480
 an average speed but they are made 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.740
 well and with the correct technique and with 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.720
 good tricks combined and left 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.980
 fabulous and actually the person does not 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.810
 is doing super fast simply 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.250
 is using the correct technique you know 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.600
 master the tricks perfectly and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.250
 combine them well and they remain excellent 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.170
 then not always the speed what 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.730
 you have to worry good the truth 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.590
 that the trick of very combinable with 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 many soccer tricks sometimes one says 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.350
 good learn a trick learn the other 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.060
 I combine it but the truth is that it is not so 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.410
 easy to make combinations the trick of 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.760
