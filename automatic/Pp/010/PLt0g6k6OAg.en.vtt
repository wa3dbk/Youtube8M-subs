 how a rectal suppository is administered 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.989
 it's that quiet here we'll explain 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.899
 which is a rectal poster for what it is 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.360
 how it is placed security measures and 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.640
 how it works in our body let's start 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 which is a rectal suppository is a type 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 of medicine that is shaped like a bullet and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.350
 is placed through the cndh or the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.690
 rectal suppository has a tip 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.699
 round and one side or straight base already 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.519
 We will see later what it is for 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.890
 one of these suppositories can be 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.750
 solids and semi-solids may have 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.320
 different sizes shapes and weights 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.910
 [Music] 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.040
 keep in mind that each suppository is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.910
 different and should be prescribed only 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.910
 by the doctor 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.140
 remember it can be annoying and does not cause 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.990
 pain what suppositories are for 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 rectal is to decrease the temperature 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.720
 of the body to treat constipation 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.010
 to control vomiting and for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.940
 people who can not take 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.940
 oral medications 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.870
 important data suppositories 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 we must take certain things into account 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.370
 as age we have to keep in mind 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.160
 that every person has a need 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.230
 different and for this it is important 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.850
 know what type of suppositories 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.000
 for each one remembering that there are 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.460
 for children and adults 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.890
 now we will see how a 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 suppository in children under 5 years old and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 it is important to follow the instructions 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.470
 from someone who has the experience 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.120
 enough for example in the case of a 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.480
 baby you can turn it is the side 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.000
 left and insert the suppository 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.320
 another way is by lifting the legs of the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.320
 baby towards her tummy 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.010
 and finally resting on his knees 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.010
 and his raised butt 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.440
 [Music] 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
 first wash your hands 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.870
 remember that hand washing is very 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.420
 important 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.190
 second takes out the suppository from 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 wrapper you do not have to manipulate not much 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 third prepare the baby remember to put 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 in any of the positions that already 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.770
 we saw earlier 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.980
 fourth lubricate the fifth suppository 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.599
 apply the suppository you have to remember 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.300
 that you have to put it from the base to 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.349
 the tip thus contracts the anus and does not 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.349
 allows the exit of the same 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.640
 and finally keep your bags together 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.950
 taking 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.470
 quiet sleeps now let's see a 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.090
 video that will explain you better 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.090
 first wash your hands 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.300
 and then place the baby in the position 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.840
 that is comfortable is better 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.610
 do not forget to lubricate the suppository 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.630
 wind 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.330
 in her 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.880
 [Music] 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.980
 it is important to stimulate the anus 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.560
 with circular movements before 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.600
 introduce the suppository finally what 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 we introduce and keep together their 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.710
 buttocks 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.270
 now let's see in children over 5 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.190
 years and adults 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.320
 we begin by placing the person in the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.160
 correct position rotated on its side 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.790
 left and with a crouched leg 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.790
 second wash your hands 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.260
 third put on gloves despite 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.290
 having washed from humans is always 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.570
 very important to introduce the suppository 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:05.180
 slowly either if someone else is 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.250
 places or if you place yourself 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.349
 remain reclining for several 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.859
 minutes to avoid expulsion of 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.160
 suppository now let's watch a video 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.750
 that better explains what we just saw 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.549
 It is important that the person you are 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.690
 you are going to put the suppository sep the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.690
 procedure that you are going to perform 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.220
 the correct position is with the person 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.970
 leaning on his left side tries 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.300
 that is comfortable in this way 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.970
 [Music] 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.270
 and with his right leg picked up towards 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.270
 your chest 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.580
 [Music] 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.090
 do not forget the hand washing is very 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:53.750
 important 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.750
 [Music] 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:12.350
 as well as lubricate the suppository 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:14.600
 [Music] 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.830
 stimulates the anus with movements 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:24.209
 circulars before introducing 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.209
 [Music] 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.290
 finally we introduce it as 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.350
 deep that we can 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.350
 [Music] 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.650
 remember the same steps and the same 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.390
 position when placing fabric by 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.500
 you alone 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:47.440
 and security measures explain to the 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.350
 person the whole procedure uses 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.760
 only what is indicated by the doctor 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.520
 wash your hands before and after the 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.770
 application to enter it by the base and not 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.890
 by the tip, avoid holding it much 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.569
 time and not of faith that is after a 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.569
 hour 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.429
 how a suppository works once 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.139
 we introduce the suppository through the anus 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:09.999
 a part of the body that is going to 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.189
 straight flame here the skin is very 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.020
 absorbent and thanks to the temperature of 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.479
 our body the suppository melts 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:29.490
 being able to absorb it and in this way 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:44.700
 we achieve the effect we want thanks 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:44.700
