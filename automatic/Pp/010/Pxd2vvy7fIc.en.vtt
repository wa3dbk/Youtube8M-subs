dimension in which you can access by

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.450 
dimension in which you can access by

making a portal out of quartz flux and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.260 
making a portal out of quartz flux and
igniting<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.820> thing<00:00:42.030> called<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
igniting it with this thing called the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.490 
igniting it with this thing called the
portal<00:00:42.570> igniter<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.350> absolutely

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
portal igniter which there is absolutely

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
portal igniter which there is absolutely
no<00:00:43.920> way<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.640> far<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.629> far<00:00:45.840> as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
no way to make as far as I can as far as

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
no way to make as far as I can as far as
I'm<00:00:46.079> concerned<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:47.460> doesn't<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:47.820> explain

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
I'm concerned it doesn't really explain

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.380 
I'm concerned it doesn't really explain
it<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> forums<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:50.120> couldn't<00:00:51.120> seem<00:00:51.329> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I'm pretty sure it's just not and let me

I'm pretty sure it's just not and let me
do<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.270> business<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.930> tiny<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.860> here

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
do my business just tiny bit here

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.210 
do my business just tiny bit here
basically<00:01:10.810> once<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.470> enter<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.040> dimension

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
basically once you enter this dimension

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.500 
basically once you enter this dimension
by<00:01:12.580> igniting<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.030> portal<00:01:13.390> oh<00:01:14.130> real<00:01:15.130> quick

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
by igniting the portal oh real quick

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.270 
by igniting the portal oh real quick
they<00:01:16.510> added<00:01:16.750> an<00:01:16.870> interesting<00:01:17.380> fire<00:01:17.950> thing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
they added an interesting fire thing

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.580 
they added an interesting fire thing
that<00:01:19.180> doesn't<00:01:19.540> let<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.720> on<00:01:19.810> fire<00:01:20.080> I<00:01:20.260> don't

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
that doesn't let you on fire I don't

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.320 
that doesn't let you on fire I don't
think<00:01:20.800> oh<00:01:22.110> yeah<00:01:23.110> better<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.440> just<00:01:23.500> don't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
think oh yeah better I just don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770 
think oh yeah better I just don't
probably<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.660> latter

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.540 

so<00:01:29.780> basically<00:01:30.080> let's<00:01:31.070> just<00:01:31.220> head<00:01:31.310> into<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
so basically let's just head into the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.050 
so basically let's just head into the
mention<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.330> mess<00:01:32.780> anything<00:01:32.990> else<00:01:33.230> so

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
mention for a mess anything else so

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.540 
mention for a mess anything else so
basically<00:01:35.060> what<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.420> dimension<00:01:35.810> adds<00:01:35.990> is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
basically what this dimension adds is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.060 
basically what this dimension adds is
nothing<00:01:37.550> it's<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.940> big<00:01:38.120> cave<00:01:38.360> full<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.710> new<00:01:39.860> ORS

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
nothing it's a big cave full the new ORS

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.040 
nothing it's a big cave full the new ORS
and<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:44.090> old<00:01:44.270> ORS<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.350> think<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.550> like

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
and the old ORS and I think it's like

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.840 
and the old ORS and I think it's like
constant<00:01:48.050> light<00:01:48.260> level<00:01:48.590> all<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.800> this<00:01:49.040> like

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
constant light level all of this like

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.240 
constant light level all of this like
this<00:01:50.120> light<00:01:50.330> level<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.780> don't<00:01:50.960> think<00:01:51.080> any

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
this light level so I don't think any

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.670 
this light level so I don't think any
hostile<00:01:52.250> mobs<00:01:52.550> spawn<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.030> here<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.530> don't

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
hostile mobs spawn in here so you don't

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.220 
hostile mobs spawn in here so you don't
have<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.890> worry<00:01:55.040> about<00:01:55.100> getting<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.850> know<00:01:56.230> but

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
have to worry about getting you know but

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
have to worry about getting you know but
great<00:01:57.410> by<00:01:58.060> creepers<00:01:59.060> while<00:01:59.270> you're<00:01:59.390> mining

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
great by creepers while you're mining

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.820 
great by creepers while you're mining
and<00:02:01.270> basically<00:02:02.270> what<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.570> what<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.350> the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
and basically what this what you the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.870 
and basically what this what you the
only<00:02:03.950> thing<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.220> could<00:02:04.370> think<00:02:04.400> of<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.610> do<00:02:04.790> in

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
only thing I could think of to do in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.130 
only thing I could think of to do in
this<00:02:04.940> dimension<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.450> set<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.750> mining<00:02:06.020> base

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
this dimension is set up a mining base

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.140 
this dimension is set up a mining base

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
oh it actually has more uses of the

oh it actually has more uses of the
diamond<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.510> does<00:03:48.470> more<00:03:48.680> damage<00:03:48.710> and

fluorite
has<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.270> same<00:03:53.450> mining<00:03:53.900> speed<00:03:54.170> as<00:03:54.380> gold<00:03:54.820> but

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
has the same mining speed as gold but

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.110 
has the same mining speed as gold but
the<00:03:56.480> durability<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.110> iron<00:03:57.590> plus<00:03:58.220> another<00:03:58.550> 800

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
the durability of iron plus another 800

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.170 
the durability of iron plus another 800
uses<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.710> just<00:04:00.920> makes<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.190> really<00:04:01.490> in<00:04:01.880> kind

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
uses so it just makes it really in kind
