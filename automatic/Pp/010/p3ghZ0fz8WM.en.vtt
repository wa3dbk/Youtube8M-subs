00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
I thought that was that's really nice

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.510 
I thought that was that's really nice
and<00:01:51.319> of<00:01:51.409> course<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.679> working<00:01:51.979> flag<00:01:52.250> looks

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
and of course the working flag looks

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.249 
and of course the working flag looks
like<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> Triforce<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.539> awesome<00:01:53.990> good<00:01:54.200> job

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
like a Triforce that is awesome good job

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.679 
like a Triforce that is awesome good job
guy<00:01:54.759> now<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.000> nice<00:01:56.149> stuffs<00:01:56.420> out<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
guy now that the nice stuffs out of the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.330 
guy now that the nice stuffs out of the
way<00:01:56.780> we<00:01:56.899> can<00:01:57.020> move<00:01:57.110> on<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.319> things<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.890> are<00:01:58.310> a

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
way we can move on to things that are a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.330 
way we can move on to things that are a
bit<00:01:58.490> more<00:01:58.610> challenging<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.659> this<00:02:00.409> one<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.890> a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
bit more challenging and this one is a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.419 
bit more challenging and this one is a
little<00:02:01.610> challenging<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.209> it<00:02:03.049> also<00:02:03.229> has<00:02:03.619> style

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
little challenging and it also has style

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.249 
little challenging and it also has style
and<00:02:04.819> physics<00:02:05.599> I<00:02:05.689> mean<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:05.869> top<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.110> everything

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
and physics I mean on top of everything

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.510 
and physics I mean on top of everything
else<00:02:06.439> right<00:02:06.649> there's<00:02:06.860> also<00:02:06.950> physics<00:02:07.340> involved

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
else right there's also physics involved

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.279 
else right there's also physics involved
so<00:02:08.209> it's<00:02:08.299> not<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.660> static<00:02:08.989> track<00:02:09.170> you're

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
so it's not just a static track you're

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.080 
so it's not just a static track you're
gonna<00:02:09.410> see<00:02:09.590> some<00:02:09.829> elements<00:02:10.190> actually<00:02:10.429> move<00:02:10.670> in

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
gonna see some elements actually move in

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.390 
gonna see some elements actually move in
a<00:02:11.209> very<00:02:11.450> very<00:02:11.599> cool<00:02:11.780> fashion<00:02:12.290> but<00:02:13.130> you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
a very very cool fashion but you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.949 
a very very cool fashion but you
actually<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:14.030> different<00:02:14.239> ways<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.870> can

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
actually have different ways you can

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.319 
actually have different ways you can
attack<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.739> back<00:02:16.130> flip<00:02:16.340> off<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:16.760> come

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
attack this so I back flip off this come

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.180 
attack this so I back flip off this come
around<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.690> edge<00:02:17.720> here<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.319> cab<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.709> clip<00:02:19.010> on

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
around the edge here now I cab a clip on

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.559 
around the edge here now I cab a clip on
to<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.579> platform<00:02:19.790> right<00:02:20.150> there<00:02:20.329> that<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.450> just

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
to that platform right there that I just

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.420 
to that platform right there that I just
touch<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.930> fail<00:02:21.109> that<00:02:21.290> or<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.160> can<00:02:22.280> move

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
touch to fail that or you can move

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.460 
touch to fail that or you can move
forward<00:02:22.790> hit<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:23.660> your<00:02:23.810> front<00:02:23.989> brake<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
forward hit with your front brake and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.900 
forward hit with your front brake and
then<00:02:24.769> move<00:02:24.950> forward<00:02:24.980> your<00:02:25.430> rear

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
then move forward your rear

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.860 
then move forward your rear
same<00:02:26.510> thing<00:02:26.690> right<00:02:26.810> here<00:02:26.989> watch<00:02:28.269> see<00:02:29.269> just

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
same thing right here watch see just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
same thing right here watch see just
enough<00:02:29.989> physics<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.980> not<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.370> super<00:02:31.730> annoying

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
enough physics to not be super annoying

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.849 
enough physics to not be super annoying
but<00:02:32.780> you're<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:32.989> gonna<00:02:33.049> add<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.350> layer<00:02:33.829> of

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
but you're just gonna add a layer of

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.160 
but you're just gonna add a layer of
challenge<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.730> right<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.150> backflip<00:02:35.900> you

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
challenge so right here backflip you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.440 
challenge so right here backflip you
want<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.190> hit<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.340> break<00:02:37.579> bring<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.329> rear

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
want to hit to break bring that rear

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.910 
want to hit to break bring that rear
tire<00:02:38.480> around<00:02:38.780> slap<00:02:39.410> your<00:02:39.560> head<00:02:39.620> against<00:02:39.859> that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
tire around slap your head against that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.520 
tire around slap your head against that
no<00:02:40.130> problem<00:02:40.609> I<00:02:41.600> hit<00:02:42.049> my<00:02:42.170> head<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.470> thing

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
no problem I hit my head on that thing

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.140 
no problem I hit my head on that thing
so<00:02:42.680> many<00:02:42.950> times<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.280> doesn't<00:02:43.400> kill<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.819> but

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
so many times it doesn't kill you but

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
so many times it doesn't kill you but
I'm<00:02:44.269> pretty<00:02:44.450> certain<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.019> keep

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
I'm pretty certain that I just keep

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.990 
I'm pretty certain that I just keep
getting<00:02:45.440> lucky<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:46.400> right<00:02:46.609> here<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> only

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
getting lucky this right here the only

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.190 
getting lucky this right here the only
challenge<00:02:47.420> here<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.690> fact<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.019> water

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
challenge here is the fact of the water

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.410 
challenge here is the fact of the water
fogs<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.650> down<00:02:48.859> but<00:02:49.340> ultimately<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
fogs you down but ultimately it is a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.330 
fogs you down but ultimately it is a
really<00:02:50.780> great<00:02:50.900> track<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.500> does<00:02:51.739> challenge<00:02:52.190> you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
really great track it does challenge you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.039 
really great track it does challenge you
and<00:02:52.549> probably<00:02:52.850> my<00:02:53.120> favorite<00:02:53.630> track<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
and probably my favorite track of the

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.140 
and probably my favorite track of the
week<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:54.769> let's<00:02:55.519> go<00:02:55.639> ahead<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.880> move<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.120> to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
week now let's go ahead and move on to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.210 
week now let's go ahead and move on to
things<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.139> little<00:02:57.560> more<00:02:57.799> dickish

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
things that are a little more dickish

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.930 
things that are a little more dickish
like<00:02:58.819> borderline<00:02:59.510> Candyland<00:03:00.049> dickish<00:03:00.940> first

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
like borderline Candyland dickish first

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.190 
like borderline Candyland dickish first
and<00:03:02.329> we'll<00:03:02.480> consider<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.930> viewer

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
and we'll consider this a viewer

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.990 
and we'll consider this a viewer
spotlight<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:03.980> if<00:03:04.069> you<00:03:04.160> have<00:03:04.310> tracks<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.910> want

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
spotlight so if you have tracks you want

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.550 
spotlight so if you have tracks you want
to<00:03:05.150> submit<00:03:05.359> for<00:03:05.600> me<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.810> take<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:05.989> look<00:03:06.170> at<00:03:06.380> and

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
to submit for me to take a look at and

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.349 
to submit for me to take a look at and
put<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.920> show<00:03:07.130> then<00:03:07.400> feel<00:03:07.670> free<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
put on the show then feel free to to

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.809 
put on the show then feel free to to
ping<00:03:08.600> me<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:08.959> your<00:03:09.319> username<00:03:10.160> your<00:03:10.370> gamertag

ping me with your username your gamertag

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.610 
ping me with your username your gamertag
I<00:03:11.120> need<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.540> nor<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.930> actually<00:03:12.230> cleans<00:03:12.380> up

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
I need that nor it actually cleans up

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.160 
I need that nor it actually cleans up
anyways<00:03:13.099> this<00:03:13.579> is<00:03:13.849> squishy<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> guy

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
anyways this is squishy this is a guy

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.420 
anyways this is squishy this is a guy
who<00:03:15.230> made<00:03:15.620> QWOP<00:03:16.099> right<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.359> he<00:03:17.690> clearly<00:03:18.019> has<00:03:18.620> an

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
who made QWOP right so he clearly has an

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.699
