00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.850 
that that came up to almost of the roof
in<00:01:35.369> fact<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.329> I've<00:01:36.420> cut<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> down<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> size<00:01:37.439> on

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
in fact so I've cut that down to size on

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.330 
in fact so I've cut that down to size on
both<00:01:38.220> sides<00:01:39.140> melted<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> plastic<00:01:40.439> over<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> bit

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
both sides melted the plastic over a bit

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.730 
both sides melted the plastic over a bit
so<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> ship<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.020> sitting<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.530> its

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so that when the ship is sitting on its

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
so that when the ship is sitting on its
gear<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.610> gear<00:01:44.820> doesn't<00:01:45.030> retract<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.780> into

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
gear the gear doesn't retract back into

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.160 
gear the gear doesn't retract back into
the<00:01:46.259> ship<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> landing<00:01:48.119> gear<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> be

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the ship the landing gear is going to be

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
the ship the landing gear is going to be
put<00:01:49.740> into<00:01:50.009> place<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.520> well<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.700> you

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
put into place as well so now if you

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.460 
put into place as well so now if you
take<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> screws<00:01:54.479> off<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.439> get

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
take the screws off you can actually get

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.950 
take the screws off you can actually get
actual<00:01:56.980> top<00:01:57.280> half<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.700> ship<00:01:57.970> off<00:01:58.650> and<00:02:00.960> then

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
actual top half of the ship off and then

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.210 
actual top half of the ship off and then
what<00:02:02.170> I've<00:02:02.260> done<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.710> basically<00:02:03.660> cut<00:02:04.660> out

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
what I've done is basically cut out

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.020 
what I've done is basically cut out
every<00:02:06.220> single<00:02:06.730> bit<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.150> plastic<00:02:08.610> which<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.640> not

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
every single bit of plastic which is not

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.330 
every single bit of plastic which is not
needed<00:02:10.330> basically<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.110> structural<00:02:12.100> walls

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
needed basically just structural walls

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.450 
needed basically just structural walls
you<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.610> see<00:02:12.910> along<00:02:13.120> here<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.620> saw<00:02:14.740> cut

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
you can see along here well just saw cut

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.080 
you can see along here well just saw cut
bits<00:02:15.700> off<00:02:15.940> some<00:02:16.600> down<00:02:16.840> there<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.790> part

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
bits off some down there and this part

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.510 
bits off some down there and this part
over<00:02:19.240> here<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.260> other<00:02:20.620> crisscrossing<00:02:21.340> lines

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
over here the other crisscrossing lines

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520 
over here the other crisscrossing lines
this<00:02:21.880> was<00:02:22.060> actually<00:02:22.210> battery<00:02:22.840> compartment

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
this was actually battery compartment

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.250 
this was actually battery compartment
that<00:02:24.130> was<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> busted<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:25.240> off<00:02:25.360> with<00:02:26.200> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
that was a busted to get off with a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.650 
that was a busted to get off with a
sharp<00:02:26.590> knife<00:02:27.300> dremel<00:02:28.300> would<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.540> been

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
sharp knife dremel would have been

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.190 
sharp knife dremel would have been
better<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.590> didn't<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.070> this<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
better but I didn't have one this is the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.330 
better but I didn't have one this is the
battery<00:02:32.200> compartment<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.800> top<00:02:33.070> side

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
battery compartment on the top side

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.030 
battery compartment on the top side
which<00:02:33.940> I'll<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.270> shut<00:02:35.230> up<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.800> select

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
which I'll just shut up and just select

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.870 
which I'll just shut up and just select
it<00:02:36.370> off<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.740> entire<00:02:39.010> Falcon<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.700> now

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
it off so the entire Falcon is now

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.660 
it off so the entire Falcon is now
actually<00:02:40.330> Hollow<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:41.320> so<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.430> start

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
actually Hollow and so I can start

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.600 
actually Hollow and so I can start
getting<00:02:42.760> some<00:02:43.060> PT<00:02:43.450> components<00:02:44.020> in<00:02:44.140> there<00:02:44.610> this

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
getting some PT components in there this

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.540 
getting some PT components in there this
book<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:46.120> that's<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> main<00:02:47.080> landing<00:02:47.470> gear

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
book here that's the main landing gear

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.699 
book here that's the main landing gear
that<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.580> going<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.060> be<00:02:49.209> epoxy<00:02:50.200> cut<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.530> into

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
that is going to be epoxy cut it into

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.820 
that is going to be epoxy cut it into
place<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.340> once<00:02:51.520> that's<00:02:51.640> done<00:02:52.260> i'll<00:02:53.260> actually

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
place and once that's done i'll actually

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.800 
place and once that's done i'll actually
cut<00:02:54.280> all<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.610> surround<00:02:55.030> off<00:02:55.180> as<00:02:55.330> well<00:02:55.540> so

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
cut all this surround off as well so

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.740 
cut all this surround off as well so
that<00:02:55.990> our<00:02:56.080> free<00:02:56.260> bit<00:02:56.560> more<00:02:56.770> space<00:02:57.750> I've

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that our free bit more space I've

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.170 
that our free bit more space I've
managed<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.080> keep<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.130> original<00:03:00.519> electronics

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
managed to keep the original electronics

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.290 
managed to keep the original electronics
inside<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.739> there's<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.160> speaker<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:04.090> we

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
inside it so there's the speaker that we

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.890 
inside it so there's the speaker that we
need<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> PCs<00:03:05.050> internal<00:03:05.620> speaker<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
need the PCs internal speaker for the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.160 
need the PCs internal speaker for the
lights<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:09.459> front<00:03:09.880> headlights<00:03:10.300> are<00:03:10.660> going<00:03:11.110> to

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
lights the front headlights are going to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.670 
lights the front headlights are going to
be<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.530> power<00:03:11.830> light<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.720> flushing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
be the power light and the flushing

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.620 
be the power light and the flushing
laser<00:03:14.890> cannons<00:03:15.430> are<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.450> drive

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
laser cannons are going to be the drive

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.199 
laser cannons are going to be the drive
activity<00:03:17.230> lights<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:19.269> on<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.690> back<00:03:19.900> here

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
activity lights and on the back here

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.330 
activity lights and on the back here
that's<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.420> end<00:03:22.570> main<00:03:22.780> engine<00:03:23.200> which<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.160> just

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
that's the end main engine which is just

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.820 
that's the end main engine which is just
a<00:03:24.519> set<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:25.019> stickers<00:03:26.019> of<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.410> minute<00:03:26.650> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
a set of stickers of a minute and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.410 
a set of stickers of a minute and
they're<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> bit<00:03:27.549> skewed<00:03:27.850> with<00:03:28.090> as<00:03:28.239> well

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
they're a bit skewed with as well

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.170 
they're a bit skewed with as well
because<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.019> wasn't<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.730> careful<00:03:30.730> as<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.940> kid

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
because I wasn't this careful as a kid

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.810 
because I wasn't this careful as a kid
as<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.570> these<00:03:31.750> days<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.459> I'm<00:03:33.459> going<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.700> put

so<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.150> engine<00:03:37.540> lights<00:03:37.720> up<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.110> lot<00:03:38.290> of

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
so that the engine lights up a lot of

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.940 
so that the engine lights up a lot of
the<00:03:38.440> power<00:03:38.920> lights<00:03:39.160> as<00:03:39.400> well<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.290> once
