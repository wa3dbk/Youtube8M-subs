sat down for the last like seven or
eight<00:00:13.559> hours<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.400> move<00:00:15.030> things<00:00:15.209> around

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
eight hours and just move things around

eight hours and just move things around
added<00:00:16.020> things<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.490> go<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.590> is

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
added things and here we go so this is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.749 
added things and here we go so this is
the<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.429> front<00:00:20.760> after<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.480> update<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> guess

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
the the front after my update so I guess

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.040 
the the front after my update so I guess
I'm<00:00:23.849> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> start<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> top<00:00:24.570> left

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I'm going to start in the top left

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.800 
I'm going to start in the top left
so<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.039> collar<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.000> same<00:00:27.240> overkill

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so the collar is the same overkill

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.150 
so the collar is the same overkill
candle<00:00:28.259> mats<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.810> shoulder<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.529> move<00:00:31.949> my

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
candle mats but this shoulder I move my

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.670 
candle mats but this shoulder I move my
gamma<00:00:32.400> bomb<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.990> when<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> was

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
gamma bomb from over here when it was

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.610 
gamma bomb from over here when it was
like<00:00:34.800> sideways<00:00:35.220> but<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.620> my

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
like sideways but look there and my

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.710 
like sideways but look there and my
Exodus<00:00:38.040> bonded<00:00:38.190> by<00:00:38.400> blood<00:00:38.580> used<00:00:39.060> to<00:00:39.150> be<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
Exodus bonded by blood used to be on the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.960 
Exodus bonded by blood used to be on the
bottom<00:00:39.870> over<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:41.580> that<00:00:41.730> was<00:00:41.820> also

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
bottom over here and that was also

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.930 
bottom over here and that was also
crooked<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.780> moved<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.740> up<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.490> well

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
crooked and moved that up there as well

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.220 
crooked and moved that up there as well
and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.750> better<00:00:45.810> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and I think that looks a lot better and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350 
and I think that looks a lot better and
I<00:00:46.740> used<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> nuclear<00:00:47.430> assault<00:00:47.940> cloth
