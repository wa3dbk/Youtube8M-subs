00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.270 
get this so looks like he's gonna use
his<00:03:39.599> clan<00:03:39.959> castle<00:03:40.229> he's<00:03:40.500> got<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.769> dragon<00:03:41.099> left

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
his clan castle he's got one dragon left

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.369 
his clan castle he's got one dragon left
this<00:03:41.669> should<00:03:41.970> probably<00:03:42.479> get<00:03:42.690> him<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.049> fifty

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
this should probably get him to fifty

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.979 
this should probably get him to fifty
percent<00:03:43.970> now<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.359> kind<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.659> risky

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
percent now this is kind of risky

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.300 
percent now this is kind of risky
because<00:03:46.109> he's<00:03:46.319> fighting<00:03:46.650> around<00:03:46.829> these<00:03:47.010> air

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
because he's fighting around these air

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.000 
because he's fighting around these air
defenses<00:03:47.790> over<00:03:48.000> here<00:03:48.349> but<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.409> looks<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
defenses over here but it looks like the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.409 
defenses over here but it looks like the
balloons<00:03:50.519> are<00:03:50.639> going<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.879> take<00:03:51.000> some<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.299> the

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
balloons are going to take some of the

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.629 
balloons are going to take some of the
firepower<00:03:51.870> off<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.470> his<00:03:52.590> dragon<00:03:53.069> so<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.519> he

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
firepower off of his dragon so that he

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.729 
firepower off of his dragon so that he
could<00:03:53.790> clean<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.239> bit<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:55.169> dragon<00:03:55.560> might

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
could clean it up a bit the dragon might

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.059 
could clean it up a bit the dragon might
take<00:03:55.979> out<00:03:56.129> one<00:03:56.459> more<00:03:56.729> weapon<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.419> you<00:03:58.229> can<00:03:58.470> it's

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
take out one more weapon if you can it's

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.000 
take out one more weapon if you can it's
not<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.310> max<00:03:59.609> dragon<00:04:00.090> what<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.799> still

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
not a max dragon what is it is still

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.809 
not a max dragon what is it is still
good<00:04:02.189> job<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.060> five<00:04:03.329> percent<00:04:03.750> left<00:04:04.669> he's<00:04:05.669> gonna

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
good job so five percent left he's gonna

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.670 
good job so five percent left he's gonna
take<00:04:06.299> out<00:04:06.449> some<00:04:06.659> of<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.810> stuff<00:04:07.049> okay<00:04:07.470> he's

going for the fifty percent good stuff

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.330 
going for the fifty percent good stuff
good<00:04:09.659> choice<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.650> don't<00:04:10.799> want<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:11.009> risk<00:04:11.129> you

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
good choice you don't want to risk you

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.649

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
same tactic it looks like he's using the

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.200 
same tactic it looks like he's using the
BB<00:05:32.319> Jake<00:05:32.830> adaptec<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.580> he's<00:05:33.759> going<00:05:34.000> for<00:05:34.150> the

his<00:05:36.310> way<00:05:36.490> around<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:37.990> actually<00:05:38.380> a

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
his way around this is actually a

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.200 
his way around this is actually a
farming<00:05:38.860> base<00:05:39.039> so<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.550> looks<00:05:39.699> like<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:40.000> goal
