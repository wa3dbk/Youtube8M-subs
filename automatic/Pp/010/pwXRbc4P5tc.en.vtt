00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.480
 we are instead fresh out with the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.480

 three large purchases that rekindle the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 Italian football after many years in which 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.890
 unfortunately we struggled a lot and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.289
 I must say a lot about this spirit 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.820
 renewed optimism passes on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.190
