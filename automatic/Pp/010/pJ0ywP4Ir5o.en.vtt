00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:06.229
 stay the bacon the video you get there that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:07.970
 We will continue there what to 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.820
 start video today let's see an easter 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.190
 bizarre egg in bs-4 after all is the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.149
 frame name will be and bizarre on the map 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.049
 today 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.049
 roars 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.280
 rush transmission on bs-4 has two 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.530
 buttons on the map that even half complicated 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.660
 you get to them because it's difficult 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.350
 but be tight at the same time. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.970
 time 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.850
 logical that it can not be a server 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.310
 empty tried a match going on and 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.350
 f4 can you hear during the match 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.020
 as if it were a sound of a tyrannosaurus 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.610
 rex and before itself as you listen 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.070
 was the tree moving like the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.610
 Tyrannosaurus had come to get 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.610
 you 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.850
 and on that same map there is a goat 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.830
 that is a steroid that even a 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.680
 reference to a jurassic movie goat 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 park in the movie she is left to 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.950
 feed a tyrannosaurus rex 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.080
 so have to see if you will hear the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.570
 roar of tyrannosaurus rex 1.4 this 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.790
 It's probably left to be 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.140
 committed by him over the partner of the law and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.120
 about her mortal remains he even has 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.269
 to see it makes sense in metal gear 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.900
 solid twin snakes you can find one 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:31.060
 game kilby and the double mário and oxy also 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.450
 appears more cute to me are up 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.150
 kind of scary and if you shoot him 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.150
 they do some things 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 features 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.130
 in the nintendo 64 perfect dark game 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.940
 there is an easter egg that does not 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.850
 anything 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.130
 fuck all the thousands of bits of 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.310
 cheese scattered throughout the game in 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.740
 possible random locations 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.300
 You go in search of them. See you there. 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.050
 game you will find this little piece of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.330
 cheese and you will not gain anything 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.400
 Pleasure to seek if you want 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.730

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.100
 fiction known as terror 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.470

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.090
 world knows several references several 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.010

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.210
 This maniac on the dead island is fine. 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.210
 hard in the fall is not so easy to kill him 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.850
 the child is the child who of course is 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.160
 only an audience reference of 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.380
 Friday 3 even because you can not 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.840

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.900
