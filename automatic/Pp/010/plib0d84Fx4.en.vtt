approaching<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.980> area<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.550> didn't<00:00:51.030> know

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
approaching this area I didn't know

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.819 
approaching this area I didn't know
where<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> door<00:00:52.199> was

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
where the door was

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.279 
where the door was
and<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.430> said<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:53.969> found<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and it said that I had found it and that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
and it said that I had found it and that
the<00:00:55.469> door<00:00:55.710> somewhere<00:00:56.160> around<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.760> first<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the door somewhere around so at first I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.130 
the door somewhere around so at first I
thought<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.329> might<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.629> been<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> other

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
thought it might have been on the other

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.880 
thought it might have been on the other
side<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.800> mountain<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> crossed

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
side of this mountain and when I crossed

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.609 
side of this mountain and when I crossed
like<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.550> river<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> no<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
like a little river to get here but no I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.580 
like a little river to get here but no I
was<00:01:04.979> wrong<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.939> River<00:01:06.299> goes<00:01:06.659> down

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
was wrong actually that River goes down

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.500 
was wrong actually that River goes down
like<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.010> waterfall<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> deal

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and it leads directly into a cave so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.890 
and it leads directly into a cave so
