00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.490
 hello to all and mickaÃ«l for take two 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.119
 tec.fr today i will show you 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.699
 how to delete data 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.970
 permanently from a hard drive or form 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.059
 was definitely a hard drive for 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.309
 what I'm talking about definitely since 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.100
 like here you see on the screen the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:45.710
 disk is empty but if ever it was 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.480
 formatted with the windows tool at the end 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.899
 of account he's just going to launder you the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.309
 score but you can with a 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.010
 data recovery software 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.800
 retrieve the data that was on that 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.379
 disk beforehand in the case of a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.699
 pc sale that can be problematic 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.259
 in the case of dengue how to say if 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.570
 you put your your computer to the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.119
 trash and that someone gets your 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.070
 computer he will be able to recover 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.080
 data so it can be if it's 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.230
 sensitive data it can be rather 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.480
 embarrassing so 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.630
 I always make sure before putting 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.600
 the trash or resell a material 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.650
 who belong to me or that he has not 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.140
 do not belong to me 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.330
 to be the pc of a customer who wants to put 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.540
 the garbage can I always make sure 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.190
 permanently delete the data 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.730
 so there are several solutions to that 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.650
 you can with a boot disk 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.250
 in use 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.350
 of arx buttons neck you can also 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.780
 use so that's what I use 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.180
 when I'm on what am I on my 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:58.060
 pc up tac tac tac he's so hard 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.550
 that it's a small hop disk 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.730
 application 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:08.530
 it is free in part and if you 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.740
 want to go a little further 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.940
 can pay and at that moment you 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.760
 will have solutions of how to say 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.180
 solutions to crush your disks 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.810
 even better 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.770
 so here we find all our records 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 you select the disc you want them 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.830
 format then know that you can 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.660
 be cleaned up the data so that's at 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.959
 tell some data just the space 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.230
 free for example if I do wipe here 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:49.870
 that's all the disk space that's not 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.200
 used that is going to be how to say who is going 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 to be cleaned cleanly though if I 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.230
 select him at that moment that 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.690
 format all the disk so there we go 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.060
 do it for example that it is if you 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.590
 see that there are a whole bunch of methods 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.590
 that we can use 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.130
 except that in the free version we do not 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.590
 can use this one so it's fine 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.340
 write heroes on all sectors 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.880
 of the disc 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:24.130
 so for finally that's enough 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.100
 if it's data that is not 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.140
 very sensitive since fo com to break 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.269
 the head to successfully recover the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.310
 data behind that though if it's 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.780
 something very very 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.100
 confidential or data 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.180
 pharmaceutical or things like that 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.040
 must perhaps go further so 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.170
 spent with 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.069
 the paid version that you see that if 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.840
 I try to use the method he tells me 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.829
 that it is not possible that I can not 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.480
 use that first method 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:59.939
 so if we do start here it will take 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.829
 confirm not to make 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.420
 nonsense and to be sure of this 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.450
 we're doing it's going 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:12.180
 must confirm in writing by writing 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:17.970
 and he has all data is there at that moment 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.769
 the formatting will start and it's not 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.530
 a classic formatting so there is some 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.570
 for a few minutes anyway there at 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.389
 know that these indices of 37 gigabytes so 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.800
 it is very small so it is that puts a 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.139
 a little less than a quarter of an hour 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.900
 on the other hand if you have a record 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.479
 of interest for example it can be very 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.639
 very long here it was just a little 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:44.070
 demo with kiel disk to know also that 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:49.110
 if you want you can create a 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.860
 boot disk which the disk so I do not 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.320
 I do not know where I am 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.199
 active disk 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.970
 goals 10th creator and there you go 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:07.020
 can create a boot cd so a little 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.169
 like like arx 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.580
 buttons nape then either you go me 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.900
 I have no cd player but either you 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.780
 go directly burn it on a 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.000
 dvd cd player or blu ray it's a shame 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.699
 to make a blu-ray because it's 6 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.530
 mega the cdf so my data guys 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.970
 so a cd that will be fine 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.300
 you can also put it on a 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.659
 usb disk so we have to make sure that 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.530
 your pc can allow butt on 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.639
 usb and or directly an image iso you 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.900
 do next 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.470
 here again we are on the 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.110
 freeware version the free version of 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.530
 we can only select the 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.639
 linux or back method 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.740
 you could have with winpe if you had 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.409
 the paid version directly have a 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.000
 bootable cd on windows and at this 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.080
 moment use the windows version 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.069
 it does not have too much interest it's the same 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.940
 thing on linux the bone version 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.469
 works very well that's what 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.919
 I use so you can stay there 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.020
 on top even if it's a little less user 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.099
 friendly 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.009
 you select the bone version 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:20.759
 next is here so you create your 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:23.639
 iso you see I already created here and 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.139
 then when you taste it on 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.759
 the cd you will have the opportunity to 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:32.219
 crush one or more disks or 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:34.600
 remove free spaces from a disk 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:38.050
 so be careful 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.230
 to this kind of method and use 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.330
 since it's usually definitive 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.720
 that we do it to you if you ever 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.140
 mislead it will be complicated to come back in 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.000
 back 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.140
 so here I hope it serves you to 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.360
 do not forget that when you sell 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.490
 material it can be interesting 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.780
 to use this kind of tool I tell you 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.780
 Researchers soon
