don't know the conditions of the road
that<00:02:45.019> you're<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.560> want<00:02:46.040> to

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
that you're on I want to

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.160 
that you're on I want to
dear<00:02:46.560> C<00:02:46.950> Mon<00:02:47.159> softer<00:02:47.610> power<00:02:47.819> delivery<00:02:48.329> but

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
dear C Mon softer power delivery but

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.000 
dear C Mon softer power delivery but
overall<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.040> go6<00:02:50.459> our<00:02:50.750> 2012<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:52.079> completely

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
overall the go6 our 2012 is completely

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.259 
overall the go6 our 2012 is completely
different<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.579> does<00:02:53.849> feel<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> lot<00:02:54.480> different

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
different and does feel a lot different

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.849 
different and does feel a lot different
so<00:02:57.269> now<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:58.079> see<00:02:58.140> they're<00:02:58.530> bikes

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
so now as you can see they're bikes

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.459 
so now as you can see they're bikes
going<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.159> track<00:02:59.609> so<00:02:59.939> it's<00:03:00.090> my<00:03:00.239> turn<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.629> go<00:03:00.780> try

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
going on track so it's my turn to go try

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.209 
going on track so it's my turn to go try
it<00:03:01.500> out<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.739> myself

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
it out for myself

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.410 
it out for myself
and<00:03:02.340> I'll<00:03:02.430> come<00:03:02.609> back<00:03:02.730> later<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.090> tell<00:03:03.329> you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and I'll come back later and tell you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:19.800 
and I'll come back later and tell you
how<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.569> works

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.059 

so<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.840> wrapped<00:03:21.110> up<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.379> full<00:03:21.560> day<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.860> writing

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
so I wrapped up a full day of writing

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.149 
so I wrapped up a full day of writing
the<00:03:22.370> new<00:03:22.519> Dijkstra<00:03:22.909> 1000<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.950> over<00:03:25.010> my

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
the new Dijkstra 1000 and going over my

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.410 
the new Dijkstra 1000 and going over my
notes<00:03:25.310> right<00:03:25.610> now<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.030> there's<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.239> lot<00:03:26.390> to

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
notes right now and there's a lot to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.860 
notes right now and there's a lot to
cover

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
cover

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.319 
cover
I<00:03:26.989> mean<00:03:27.170> first<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.250> foremost<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.939> engine

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
I mean first and foremost the engine

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.369 
I mean first and foremost the engine
changes<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:30.409> me<00:03:30.849> we're<00:03:31.849> pretty<00:03:32.599> noticeable<00:03:32.959> I

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
changes for me we're pretty noticeable I

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.069 
changes for me we're pretty noticeable I
mean<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:34.609> bottom<00:03:34.939> end<00:03:35.090> power<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.689> a<00:03:35.720> lot

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
mean the bottom end power is a lot

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.720 
mean the bottom end power is a lot
improved<00:03:36.500> from<00:03:36.980> last<00:03:37.040> year

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
improved from last year

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.390 
improved from last year

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
flowing torque in the mid-range you can

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.559 
flowing torque in the mid-range you can
feel<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:40.670> when<00:03:40.760> you're<00:03:40.849> riding<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.180> buck<00:03:41.329> it's

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
feel it when you're riding the buck it's

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.619 
feel it when you're riding the buck it's
just<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.140> good<00:03:42.349> solid<00:03:43.280> boost<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.450> power

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
just a good solid boost in power

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.179 
just a good solid boost in power
compared<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.349> previous<00:03:45.769> year

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and the different riding modes - it's a

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.530 
and the different riding modes - it's a
very<00:03:49.970> noticeable<00:03:51.129> shift<00:03:52.129> in<00:03:52.700> power<00:03:52.909> between<00:03:53.090> a

calipers<00:03:57.129> just<00:03:58.129> have<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:58.760> much<00:03:59.180> power<00:03:59.510> but

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
calipers just have so much power but

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.410 
calipers just have so much power but
it's<00:04:00.349> completely<00:04:00.799> manageable<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:01.970> you

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
it's completely manageable you can you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.059 
it's completely manageable you can you
can<00:04:02.569> get<00:04:02.689> on<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> brakes<00:04:03.139> as<00:04:03.560> hard<00:04:03.620> as<00:04:03.950> you

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
can get on the brakes as hard as you

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.759 
can get on the brakes as hard as you

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
familiar feel your sit in the bike

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.230 
familiar feel your sit in the bike
rather<00:04:36.440> than<00:04:36.650> on<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.130> bike<00:04:37.310> like<00:04:37.639> and<00:04:37.820> just

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
rather than on the bike like and just

rather than on the bike like and just
like<00:04:38.570> every<00:04:38.990> other<00:04:39.020> Suzuki<00:04:39.710> I've<00:04:39.800> ridden<00:04:39.979> in

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
like every other Suzuki I've ridden in

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.390
