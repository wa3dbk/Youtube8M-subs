very well that this water produces an

alkaline effect in the body and that it
can<00:03:22.880> actually<00:03:23.750> reverse<00:03:24.290> metabolic<00:03:25.220> acidosis

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
can actually reverse metabolic acidosis

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.360

acidotic and the acidosis was reversed

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.509 
acidotic and the acidosis was reversed
virtually<00:03:38.030> instantly<00:03:38.600> by<00:03:39.380> the
