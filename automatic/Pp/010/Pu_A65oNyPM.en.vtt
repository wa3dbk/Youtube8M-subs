the idea of home you carries I've had

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.670 
the idea of home you carries I've had
because<00:02:27.010> I'd<00:02:27.130> at<00:02:27.310> least<00:02:27.430> 15<00:02:28.350> donuts<00:02:29.350> plus

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
because I'd at least 15 donuts plus

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.950 
because I'd at least 15 donuts plus
already<00:02:30.190> bowls<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.520> pasta<00:02:30.880> know<00:02:31.690> some<00:02:31.900> other

already bowls of pasta know some other

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.560 
already bowls of pasta know some other
things<00:02:32.260> are<00:02:32.410> heading<00:02:32.650> between<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.570> then

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
things are heading between that and then

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.700 
things are heading between that and then
also<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.440> had<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:36.000> big<00:02:37.000> pizza<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.530> evening

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
thing I that day after this i think i

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.100
