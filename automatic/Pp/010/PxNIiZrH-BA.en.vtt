you may be asking the question why are
there<00:00:03.959> so<00:00:04.350> many<00:00:04.410> keyboards<00:00:05.220> on<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.609> organ

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
there so many keyboards on this organ

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.759 
there so many keyboards on this organ
well<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:08.130> helps<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.570> more<00:00:09.630> variation<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
well it helps to have more variation and

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.400 
well it helps to have more variation and
usually<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> larger<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> organ<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.170> more

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
usually the larger the organ the more

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.250 
usually the larger the organ the more
keyboards<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.219> are<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.360> smallest<00:00:15.750> organs

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
keyboards there are the smallest organs

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.010 
keyboards there are the smallest organs
have<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.830> keyboard<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.090> largest<00:00:18.600> organ<00:00:18.930> in

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
have one keyboard the largest organ in

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.080 
have one keyboard the largest organ in
the<00:00:19.140> world<00:00:19.380> has<00:00:20.100> seven<00:00:21.140> each<00:00:22.140> keyboard

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
the world has seven each keyboard

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.689 
the world has seven each keyboard
corresponds<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.269> eight<00:00:24.930> separate<00:00:25.769> section<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
corresponds to eight separate section of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.019 
corresponds to eight separate section of
the<00:00:26.970> organ<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> separate<00:00:28.439> division<00:00:29.029> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the organ or a separate division the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.060 
the organ or a separate division the
great<00:00:30.359> has<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.679> loudest<00:00:32.099> stops<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.739> swell

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
great has the loudest stops the swell

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
great has the loudest stops the swell
has<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.910> softest<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.149> possible<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
has the softest so it is possible to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.400 
has the softest so it is possible to
jump<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:41.040> keyboard<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.329> other<00:00:42.600> very

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
jump from one keyboard to the other very

00:00:43.410 --> 00:03:23.100 
jump from one keyboard to the other very
quickly<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.850> great<00:00:45.270> variation<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.379> sound

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:36.620 

you
