and<00:02:34.700> same<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.030> side

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
and same for this side

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.920 
and same for this side
you're<00:02:37.890> gonna<00:02:38.040> um<00:02:38.400> actually<00:02:38.579> strain<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you're gonna um actually strain it to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
you're gonna um actually strain it to
the<00:02:40.170> lip<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.690> run<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.170> through<00:02:43.700> my<00:02:44.700> hair

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940

the lip and just run it through my hair
is<00:02:45.150> very<00:02:45.390> different<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.799> think<00:02:46.829> I<00:02:47.160> case

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
is very different and I think I case

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.470 
is very different and I think I case
training<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.269> style<00:02:51.140> okay<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.609> side<00:02:53.879> or

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
training or style okay like this side or

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.180 
training or style okay like this side or
the<00:02:54.659> waist<00:02:54.780> cut<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.349> really<00:02:55.500> different<00:02:55.829> I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the waist cut is really different I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.190 
the waist cut is really different I
don't<00:02:56.250> know<00:02:56.430> why<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.109> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
don't know why but so it is going to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.670 
don't know why but so it is going to
look<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.769> different<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.500> then

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
look a little bit different and then

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.170 
look a little bit different and then
next<00:03:01.950> you're<00:03:02.220> gonna<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.670> nose<00:03:02.849> is<00:03:03.000> there

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
next you're gonna do the nose is there

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.110 
next you're gonna do the nose is there
and<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.690> usually<00:03:04.409> do<00:03:04.829> three<00:03:05.129> layers<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.030> is

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
and I usually do three layers so this is

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.449 
and I usually do three layers so this is
going<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.299> be<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.450> second<00:03:06.810> layer<00:03:07.159> I'm<00:03:08.159> just
