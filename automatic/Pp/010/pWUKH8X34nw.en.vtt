00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi all guys here you must have 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.069
 welcome to this new video for 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.690
 regarding assassin's creed ions 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 that again there are quite a few 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 news to communicate those girls or 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.360
 repeat the first place as if you were ready 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 I usually remind you to pass by mine 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.350
 Facebook page to leave them a like 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.029
 but obviously be updated on 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 all the news regarding the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.869
 my channel and to download mine too 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.850
 free bre browser exemptions 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.740
 that guy finally got them after this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 usual premise we can start with the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.490
 real information of the game this time 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 there is a bit of information as to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's about the game itself so not so much 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 limited editions like that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.660
 in fact we start immediately from the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 information on arno we talk about 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.079
 customization of our character 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 not with regards to the aesthetic side 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.710
 but above all as regards the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.570
 let's say the real skills in the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.559
 our protagonist a little as seen on 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 watch dog if possible 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.100
 then customize arno skills 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.079
 or through a real one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 branching skills the three themes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 main will be that of stealth 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 of combat and navigation in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.829
 this case the navigation has me a little 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 displaced in fact seems to be a name 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.729
 rather strange perhaps a translation 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 wrong from English anyway not 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.909
 just precisely because the game maybe 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.040
 further information we may have further 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.960
 quotes unbalanced beyond each 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 so we will decide the priority 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 to give each individual a skill 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.140
 so in this way we can choose 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.299
 to have a character maybe scarce 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 of the fight but just stronger 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 so regarding the state side then 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.880
 maybe it will be us then decide during the course 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.770
 of the different missions in which way 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.570
 then approach us maybe trying to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.549
 move without being caught and prevented 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 precisely the fighting the truth in 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.150
 which we are most lacking information 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 instead, there are interesting things to do 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.869
 it's about the coop mode or the one 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 by which we can precisely 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.439
 play up to four players with i 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.329
 our friends and see a place has been 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.040
 announced how I suspected among other things 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.540
 that it will be possible to speak with ours 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.490
 friends to the point via a microphone 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 headphones also because in fact 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 this way we can in quotes 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.009
 also plan the actions in play 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.719
 these missions to carry out with the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.409
 friends will have real degrees 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.210
 therefore starting from 1 to 5 clearly 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.219
 one is the easiest one the 5 the most 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.840
 complicated and above all there will be 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.759
 of emissions for example of 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.360
 be played by two by three or by 4 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.099
 players 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.019
 in the case where for example we are in 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.239
 three but the mission must be carried out by 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.280
 We can still play 4 players 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.870
 but it will therefore be more difficult precisely for 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.730
 complete it clearly nothing of 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.470
 impossible, for example, on the other 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.360
 part if we are to serve a mission 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.879
 intended for two players but us instead 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.410
 we are in 34 will be much easier 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.060
 as far as missions are concerned 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.950
 secondary will be divided into several 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 groups which are waiting for only the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.849
 murder mystery and the equal story in the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.890
 first we will have to solve a mystery 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.220
 tied up several killers that took place in 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.530
 city 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.450
 we will have to tremble and behave like gods 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.910
 detective then find information 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.470
 to then go back to the murderer 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.569
 once these missions are completed 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.160
 we could obtain weapons 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.840
 special ones that are precisely those 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 used by the killer to eliminate 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.000
 their victims 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.069
 this in my opinion a city indeed 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.560
 very particular that also gives between 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.000
 quotes a sense to the says but 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.500
 the acquisition of new weapons from 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.849
 use within the game 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.099
 as for the others 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.630
 secondary missions or bari stories 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.150
 will be possible will come into contact 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.370
 just talk to the citizens with them 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.079
 and understand different situations in a way 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.239
 such as to then start this sort of 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.130
 missions for example a certain il 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.470
 citizen could take charge of 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.599
 eliminate a guard or whatever we say 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.190
 of the emissions following this trail 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.280
 more or less perhaps as we have seen 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.989
 in the pigeon house with assassin's creed 4 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.669
 live blacks and in previous chapters 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.680
 furthermore it will be possible to attend 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.989
 several random events that happen 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.940
 in the city ​​we will then decide precisely 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.470
 whether to intervene or not something of the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.359
 kind if you remember we have already seen it 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.160
 in the previous chapters but this time 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.700
 in fact I will be more able than I know 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.319
 we will have to stop an attack or one 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.540
 robbery inside a church that 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.130
 therefore it is not limited to something shocking 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.109
 of a few seconds in my opinion also 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.579
 this is the very particular idea then 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.489
 a kind of mini is undertaken 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.709
 secondary mission when 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.329
 we ingest just another city 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.010
 interesting feature that in 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.930
 reality has been eliminated more than 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.180
 addition is that concerning the fact 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.519
 that there will be no more guards 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.350
 his times precisely of paris by a certain 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.360
 this point of view could be 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.190
 that it is an evil that a good will indeed be 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.240
 possible perhaps in this way carry out 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.220
 missions easier 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.260
 plan our actions precisely 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.940
 from above without making us 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.890
 identify from our enemies though 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.300
 however I have software announced that 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.210
 the guards therefore those who clearly 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.890
 they will be grounded on the floor of the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.930
 terrain will be a whole lot more difficult 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.060
 to be eliminated we hope because anyway 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.890
 how do you know combat not always 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.260
 was finally praised then 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.300
 boy this time maybe we will take 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.340
 a bit of blows from the guards who 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.140
 they will want to eliminate us we pass now 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 instead something we might be interested in 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.560
 we are talking to collectors 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.690
 of the assassin's creed guides iii 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.280
 unity in fact of official guides who 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.110
 have been announced and two then 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.570
 those in standard edition and then 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.330
 that collector's edition if 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.060
 the first coast are special editions 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.610
 about $ 19 will have 280 pages while 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.440
 instead the second one will cost about 33 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.410
 dollars so a lot more will have the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.690
 hard cover and will reach about 30 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.600
 35 pages to which will be present further 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.550
 secrets and the artwork of the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.410
 I would like to point out to you that at the moment 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.970
 two guides are present on the maison k 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.040
 therefore I am in English clearly of the 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.810
 need then wait for it to come between 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.640
 quotes announced also in Italy 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.710
 sure the standard edition will come from 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.050
 It will instead see the edition 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.850
 information from the collection 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.800
 that goes off together for this week 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.570
 end here if not 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.980
 have seen the previous videos in which 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.570
 It went quite a bit of information I 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.370
 I recommend clicking on the thumbnails that 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.080
 see on the screen because precisely why 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.460
 used to those videos I remind you 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.690
 also to leave a like if 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.340
 you liked this video and 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.050
 leave me a comment below for 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.030
 let me know what you think of these 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.500
 news also I remember to register 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.060
 to my channel by clicking on the logo that 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.920
 you see screens in this way you are 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.690
 sure you don't miss any videos in 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.370
 those arriving in the coming days 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.700
 guys I greet you and see you soon 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.700
 Hello
