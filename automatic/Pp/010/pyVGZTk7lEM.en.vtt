want on there mine doesn't have that
though<00:03:43.630> mine<00:03:44.200> says<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.579> you<00:03:45.700> could<00:03:45.850> say<00:03:46.500> it

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
though mine says and if you could say it

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.880 
though mine says and if you could say it
says<00:03:48.360> ghd<00:03:49.360> um<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.630> ghg<00:03:53.230> then<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.799> a

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
says ghd um this is ghg then it's like a

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.590 
says ghd um this is ghg then it's like a
serial<00:03:54.280> number<00:03:54.549> there<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.060> makes<00:03:55.510> me

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
serial number there so that makes me

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.720 
serial number there so that makes me
think<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.290> might<00:03:56.890> be<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:57.340> part<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.670> it

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
think that this might be this part of it

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.170 
think that this might be this part of it
might<00:03:57.880> be<00:03:58.000> real<00:03:58.209> um<00:03:58.480> I<00:03:59.410> don't<00:03:59.560> know<00:03:59.829> I<00:04:00.180> came

might be real um I don't know I came

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.870 
might be real um I don't know I came
with<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:02.010> carrying<00:04:03.010> case<00:04:03.280> which<00:04:04.239> seems<00:04:05.200> legit

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
