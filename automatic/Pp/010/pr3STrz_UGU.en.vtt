00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
come through to qualify at that stage so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.560 
come through to qualify at that stage so
had<00:00:49.410> nothing<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.190> lose<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> course<00:00:51.030> he

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
had nothing to lose but of course he

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.090 
had nothing to lose but of course he
would<00:00:51.719> try<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> hundred<00:00:52.289> percent<00:00:52.379> anyway<00:00:52.890> but

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
would try a hundred percent anyway but

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
would try a hundred percent anyway but
it<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.370> seems<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.820> maybe<00:00:53.969> he<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.809> possibly

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.590 
it just seems that maybe he was possibly
going<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> few<00:00:56.100> shots<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.390> more

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to you the other day it almost looked a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
to you the other day it almost looked a
little<00:01:48.509> bit<00:01:48.689> arrogant<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
little bit arrogant and and you just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980

dispensing winners left right and center
well<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> think<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.189> way<00:01:56.310> Rogers<00:01:56.729> move<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
well I think the way Rogers move the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.350 
well I think the way Rogers move the
fluidity<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:59.369> languages<00:02:00.030> actually

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
fluidity there how languages actually

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.780 
fluidity there how languages actually
belies<00:02:00.869> how<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:01.920> years<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.250> makes<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> look<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
belies how good years it makes it look a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
belies how good years it makes it look a
lot<00:02:03.420> easier<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.990> any<00:02:04.170> many<00:02:04.469> years<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
lot easier there any many years and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
lot easier there any many years and
we've<00:02:05.579> been<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:05.759> fortunate<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.420> watch

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

from<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> federacy<00:03:24.819> V<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.419> will<00:03:25.540> have

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.869 
from the federacy V so they will have
bonded<00:03:26.049> over<00:03:26.139> i<00:03:26.319> think<00:03:26.650> now<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.220> he<00:03:27.400> does<00:03:27.669> have
