00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hello, today I want to tell you about 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.179
 gas burners unusual to bring 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.099
 chesky gas burners where you can 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:18.020
 heat up food heat water then 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.000
 have we set aside today they 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.769
 I would not like to talk 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 about gas burners more compact and 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:32.480
 for another intended for example 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:39.110
 what for something to warm up 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 burning like this for by i don't 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.579
 Firstly, this burner is small 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 compactly 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 worth putting on extreme 3 dollars bought 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.329
 I use about a year and a half ago 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.770
 pleased she gives a flame of 1300 degrees 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:06.479
 it is possible to set fire and fix something 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.630
 there is nothing you need to keep everything so she 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.240
 running is burning maybe many already 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.600
 have seen such burners 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.640
 very easy to kindle fires something 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.740
 I do not know what to solder 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 it was possible not to use 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 provodochki of course very but with 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.460
 rescued her task 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.740
 ate 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 so this is one burner and the second kind 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.009
 burners that I have warmers 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.540
 pencil is also a possibility that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.000
 set fire to warm up 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:51.790
 also more serious flame means 2 burners 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.480
 one type of this burner for four years already 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.080
 and the day before yesterday I bought a talk about 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.410
 them a little bit more in detail means old 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.210
 the hot water bottle still didn't suit me 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.229
 beaten recently tried to clean it 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.030
 and screwed up 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.640
 jet nozzle is a small gasket 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 with a very small hole thanks 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:28.320
 which creates special pressure 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:28.320
 pressure and something stopped working 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:38.700
 pressure is created under which so here 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:43.209
 burns and also gives a plan at the tip 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.500
 about 1300 degrees or more that 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.030
 allow handkerchiefs this stuff there 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.440
 silver can gold be used 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.610
 any jewelers dental technicians on 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.489
 and here I use it for soldering several 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.370
 years ago, and I usually burned a soldering iron 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.130
 from then i used this rescued 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.410
 go home like that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.890
 outside even the city accounted for 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.959
 several times I solder provodochki 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.549
 knew what was coming it therefore took with 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:26.280
 yourself so usually at home there is such 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:29.380
 mobile set is the same as here 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.510
 They are these here nasadochka 4 pieces 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:37.030
 many, too, there are four things nozzles 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.750
 a variety of such a nozzle which 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.799
 allows 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.739
 the torch turn the soldering iron and here 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.430
 few words i'm also getting about this 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.760
 nozzle in such a simple movement 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:55.099
 put on 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.340
 and turn into soldering iron burners that 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.939
 I wonder what the system works with him 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.900
 the following need to unscrew 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.920
 set on fire warms up such you 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.739
 flushed there present 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.079
 catalytic grid disassembled 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.310
 she looks like this when she warmed up 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.109
 we turn off the gas 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.699
 turn it on we do not light a penny 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.940
 incandescence is preserved due to this 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.039
 constant temperature maintained 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:33.380
 can understand without fear of burning anything 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:35.740
 fire tip is inserted and you can 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.970
 work solder 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.020
 2 I disassembled the burner this thing more 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.300
 the little ring began to sit badly decided 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.500
 strengthen but immediately with it means here 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.500
 catalytic lattice small such 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.220
 here he is 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.770
 thanks to which the temperature is constantly 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.790
 sting temperature maintained 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.930
 400 degrees can calm anything 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:17.040
 steam go such 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:21.080
 ordinary gas lighters spray can 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.120
 10 hryvnia a little more than a dollar means 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.960
 such a burner was not the first time in 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.420
 how much I bought for 60 or 70 hryvnia in 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:36.060
 this time it already cost 120 hryvnia 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.280
 new mobile phone 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:43.730
 for soldering 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:47.940
 a piece of rosin count then I'll be solder and 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.090
 so simple copper wire just 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.970
 the wire can warm it up something 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.970
 punching some plastic 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.180
 very convenient what is a burner what is 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:05.900
 make fires 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.830
 especially if the weather is wet or raining 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:16.650
 firewood is raw there can be reheated well 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:19.380
 set fire generally help out most likely 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.710
 here this will go to live in a backpack which 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.740
 I'm in the car 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:29.810
 such a universal typesetter for themselves 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:32.090
 I'll be there vase dishes dose knife . seasoning 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.610
 campfire 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.390
 this is such a pocket version of it 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.970
 home but just in case something can 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.540
 need to be soldered though already bought on 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:49.910
 replacing a new soldering iron but bought a powerful one 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:54.690
 60 wat don't know how much this gives 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:57.430
 quite enough to solder 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.130
 I hope the video will be as useful and 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.000
 interesting thank you for your attention success 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.000
 all the best
