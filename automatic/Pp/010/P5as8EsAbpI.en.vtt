00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
car just yet so forgive me for that but

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.030 
car just yet so forgive me for that but
it<00:02:20.610> has<00:02:20.849> some<00:02:20.970> nice<00:02:21.120> attack<00:02:21.510> points<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.040> 1800

it has some nice attack points with 1800

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
it has some nice attack points with 1800
so<00:02:23.099> that's<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.370> bad<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.879> art<00:02:24.030> time<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so that's not bad for the art time and I

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.030 
so that's not bad for the art time and I
guess<00:02:24.959> too<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.260> another<00:02:25.440> way<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> banish

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
guess too it's another way to banish

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.500 
guess too it's another way to banish

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
and then able to increase the tag it
supposed<00:02:29.579> to<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.700> 500<00:02:30.269> tags<00:02:30.420> still<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.019> question

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
supposed to be 500 tags still a question

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.229 
supposed to be 500 tags still a question
mark<00:02:31.379> on<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.250> few<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.819> these<00:02:32.909> picture<00:02:33.209> a

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
mark on that so a few of these picture a

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.399 
mark on that so a few of these picture a
little<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.510> unconfirmed<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.200> people

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
little bit unconfirmed because people

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.809 
little bit unconfirmed because people
have<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.590> zoom<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.099> check<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.610> believe

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
have a zoom in and check but I believe

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.100 
have a zoom in and check but I believe
that's<00:02:35.940> going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.209> be<00:02:36.269> correct<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
that's going to be correct on that I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's going to be correct on that I
don't<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.680> really<00:02:37.829> changing<00:02:38.250> too<00:02:38.370> much

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
don't see that really changing too much

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.880 
don't see that really changing too much
but<00:02:39.810> yeah<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.049> just<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.319> way<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.470> increase

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
but yeah it's just a way to increase

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.500 
but yeah it's just a way to increase
attack<00:02:41.220> which<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.670> help<00:02:41.909> out<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.239> SAR<00:02:42.390> Tech's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
to fit together to cart I want to test

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.270 
to fit together to cart I want to test
out<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.090> see<00:02:48.359> but<00:02:49.049> i'm<00:02:49.500> mainly<00:02:49.769> hoping<00:02:50.099> for

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
out and see but i'm mainly hoping for

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.740 
out and see but i'm mainly hoping for
better<00:02:50.370> fusions<00:02:50.849> for<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.180> art<00:02:51.359> that's<00:02:51.629> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
better fusions for this art that's the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.660 
better fusions for this art that's the
