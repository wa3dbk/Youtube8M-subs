00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.310
 will be all here we are the tnt run and 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.980
 we have to say a little thing is that I 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.620
 I have put to record because I have already won 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.870
 today three tnt run games and I have not 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.360
 recorded none you know 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.100
 so I've made the decision to record 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.500
 is to see what happens 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.500
 logically you have to know that this is not 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.880
 I'm going to win it because I'm 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.660
 recording does not happen anything has more slowly 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.370
 more free way that's true and also 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 people are falling and I almost came out 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.149
 one because I just fell just 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.519
 in front and this is going to bind me 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.579
 would effectively give me 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.559
 partner this one also reality and we're going 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.760
 to nobody else so now I have it 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.140
 much more crappy because now it's the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 penultimate plant and I have to comment 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.190
 here and everything I can 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.420
 this is going this today that you fall 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.400
 over your head you know this we're going 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.270
 that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.800
 wait for this you also liked him 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.660
 he has to do the double jump and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.910
 play it because if I was not going to die there 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.800
 in a resounding way then I have 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.420
 decided to play it with the double jump 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.770
 Beware of this one that goes through here mother 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.620
 mine of what I just got rid of stratus 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 of what I'm getting everything in 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.540
 against stratus we are opening 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.490
 but everything we found to another another what 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.490
 go through here please but what's up 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:39.560
 all the touch of touch was lost and give me 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560
 morally forces 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.490
 because this one came out overalia nobel 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.800
 he would no longer give me a false alarm 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.420
 this crime this way a false alarm does not 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.500
 nothing happens but it is possible that it would make me 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.990
 now why are we both going to the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 same place you are already walking through a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 very dangerous area how you fall 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.790
 you can not go down to the bottom 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.650
 danger there is no danger stratus why 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.900
 I do not fall look is controlling 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.580
 controlling the thing is in controlling 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.920
 my mother, the gaps below 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.520
 partner 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.680
 my mother who is doing that tunnel 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.990
 the little boy was called my mother 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.850
 I am rolling you are holding it falls 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.850
 another teammate let's go four 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:36.420
 it was clear that there are 24 seconds left 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.620
 our death 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.120
 you think we 're going to die stratus or I think 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.510
 what are we going to do that we are lions are 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.510
 huevones 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.599
 but be careful with the lions because 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.150
 it is also true that they cling to everything 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.150
 what can 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.440
 I almost came out one almost there was one that 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.150
 has come to have gone direct do not come 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.910
 I think everyone is going through here 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.860
 let's both accompany and we will pass 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.190
 over here we're going to jump to lift 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.690
 game down the middle in the middle 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:19.599
 We play excited, I think that everyone 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.079
 my competitors like they have fallen for 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.319
 down 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.739
 so here all the bastard yes so 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.510
 Now it's ok I'm too quiet 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.620
 Callo is worth it because I fall too 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.620
 I'm on the second floor as more 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.610
 let's play those five here here 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:58.570
 the fact of not keeping a little is worth your 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.280
 you see making space there so that people 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.170
 drop wait if it crosses one but 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.450
 that is not coÃ±a vale has not had to 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.190
 throw away mate we're going to go to 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.560
 bera bera bera bera we are in the 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.710
 penultimate strata are 18 players and 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.660
 all I'm seeing is perfect, less is 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.280
 going through this area just gave me a 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.739
 tie that hallucinates stratus pears and 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.959
 free is do not have to be thought 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.910

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.260

 in that area where I am now cleaning 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.990
 this is a little worth to make time worth 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.570
