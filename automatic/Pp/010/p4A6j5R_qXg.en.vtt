00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and the gardens what I just saw 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.980
 conference and in games with those 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.469
 com is Europe's largest video game tv 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.049
 it is clear that during the conference they 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 talked about ip voip that 16 of them 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 announced several new features 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.859
 announced a new gaming system that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 I think it's worth staying in 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.760
 expectancy 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 called foot jorge that can be played 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.010
 online and offline, consisting of four 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.800
 but it was not very clear whether 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.469
 you will play those four matches or 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 If you miss a match you are already 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.800
 outside the same site of inflation did not 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.200
 very clear but how does the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.750
 football to afp well nice watch 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 so you can play the future afi you 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 have to pay 15 thousand coins or 300 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.989
 point or at the top or an entrance that you 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.090
 You will find 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.579
 opening the packages and opened the package goes 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 have a letter to you won a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.049
 entrance to the future here so it is so 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.780
 that works in these three ways 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.520
 you enter the competition after you have 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.960
 got the entrance 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 you will choose a formation from your 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 team I believe that information stuff 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.590
 will be available you will choose 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.780
 a training you never played a 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 training you play whenever you go 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.950
 choose your training 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 after you've chosen your training 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 you will be able to choose a captain to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 your team you can choose between 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.040
 five players according to the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.829
 information provided by law, these five 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.310
 players who can be the captain of your 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.729
 super superstar stars are 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 good players and then will not be 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.460
 Pathetic players telling themselves they will be 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.759
 famous players I believe 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 diego costa messi houses 12 and the good ones 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.130
 players then you will choose one 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.680
 captain between these five players 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.450
 regardless of the position he plays in the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.759
 team can be a lateral one can be a 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.310
 goalkeeper can be a means of field the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.440
 attacker 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.599
 after you choose the captain you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.840
 will there have your team training only 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.230
 with the captain the other players of the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.810
 time will be given to you that a way 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.780
 random you will start with the goalkeeper 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.630
 It will stay in the keeper's face there. 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.940
 to draw five goalkeepers completely 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.280
 can in any alloy 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.890
 The net in any goalkeeper can be 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.050
 port al altÃ´nia 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.450
 I do not know if Bruno plays but you will. 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.160
 receive a random goalkeeper 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.650
 after you've chosen your goalie 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.540
 You go to the defenders it's the same thing. 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.959
 You will click on the letter and you will 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.299
 receive five random defenders can 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.030
 be good defenders can be defender 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.650
 the river made completely random 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.950
 suppose you were lucky and you 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.299
 you can choose the port a for the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.900
 you were chosen the quarterbacks and the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.269
 five random players were the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.760
 sergio ramos do real madrid 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.370
 chelsea cart and other 3 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.370
 whatever it is now up to you and for a team 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.230
 stronger or try to do something with 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.579
 chemistry you can choose the cart 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.220
 that there is great confidence that goes from 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.170
 with the keeper or you can 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.450
 put the sergio branches that is a pure of the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.910
 defender plus one chemist with the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.400
 goalkeeper and so on to all the others 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.370
 positions or builds a super strong team 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.829
 choosing the best players 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.410
 randomly from each position or you try 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.870
 make a team with chemistry that we all 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.000
 we know chemistry influences and much 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.880
 during matches 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.700
 So I think it's cool, you have it. 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.370
 who are lucky and know how to choose their 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.590
 players and I found this super cool 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.780
 according to the gay site any 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.410
 player may appear randomly 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.959
 during the selection of players during 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.180
 team selection even the legends 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.850
 on the xbox and they said it 's possible 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.950
 that the LEDs appear during the choice 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.130
 of the players I find it very difficult but 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.709
 Surely there will be a case of a 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.230
 in a million appear legend is that 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.700
 you put your team random after 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.950
 You just set up your team. 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.650
 reserves are given by and do not have 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.229
 no information of which we too 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.800
 let's choose the reserves so 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.900
 showed a video reservations will appear 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.729
 out of nowhere without you choosing 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.800
 absolutely nothing reserves will be 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.880
 given by the game because it is the most 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
 important 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.030
 It is certainly the team that owns the team that 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.130
 you chose 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.210
 after you've finished everything team owner 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.310
 reservations 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.380
 It's time to play as I already told you. 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.630
 play online or offline 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.720
 you can listen to up to four matches 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.880
 but this was not clear if you lost 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.530
 the first match is over 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.270
 the only thing they have told me is that 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.490
 You lose the first match you go. 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.770
 receive premiums that justify the price of 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.780
 admission in the championship I believe 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.460
 It will be two gold packages, you were mine. 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.210
 first game he already takes care of the package 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.030
 gold and you base you winning the 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.030
 awards will increase you won the 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.460
 first game the prize will be better if 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.650
 You are my game, lost the second. 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.669
 the prize is going to be better than me 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.380
 first game 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.750
 if you can win the four 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.450
 wins and yes of this competition 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.360
 they made me this competition you 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.550
 winning your prize will be much higher 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.240
 will be a fucking prize will know 30 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.190
 thousand coins 50 thousand coins four packs 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.349
 gold do not know 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.180
 to Rocco like this but the prize will be 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.390
 great then I particularly found 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.860
 a very nice game system and I 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.050
 I really can not wait to play 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.930

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.690

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.640
 can no longer play that game does not 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.440
 I can handle this rush more 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.330
 I can not do it, I can not 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.479
 I can not wait to play fifa 16 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.520
 I also want to find out if the 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.229
 game would still compete with that 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.000
 lots of stuff I'm waiting for 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.949
