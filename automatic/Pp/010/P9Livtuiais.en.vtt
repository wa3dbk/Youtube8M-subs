00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.590
 Here I have another piece of the montage of 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.110
 the bushings in a fork that 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.630
 the bars are damaged then at 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.210
 be with ease in certain points 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.400
 really the four caps that 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.900
 let's say the original four we 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.640
 we would find that the slack and already 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.380
 just where the caps are 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.069
 new with what we still have 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.189
 cures then what I have done is 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.860
 section the bushes to put in 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.750
 that at the draft one in between so that 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.720
 during the entire journey that the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.510
 bar inside the bottle hold 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.850
 let's say the line and although there are some 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.390
 points where it is worn do not have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.329
 oscillations 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.460
 you have and nothing I will try to see how 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.829
 it works but I'm going to ride and then d 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.280
 I put the next part of him 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.040
 well I have already mounted the caps 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.350
 in the fork 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.500
 What I have done is make 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.270
 with the lower sockets I have 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.970
 taken away 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.120
 what is a 10 millimeters to put it 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.550
 in the interim to invest we have 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.280
 two guides that would be superior and the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.190
 lower have three then well 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.650
 we got the fork to have three 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.450
 support points since it has wear 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.690
 on forks that have already suffered a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.820
 wear in caps we get that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.190
 when he travels always so 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.100
 minus two points touch the fork 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:45.030
 where they are in good condition because if the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.600
 we leave as is the hairpin 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.210
 it's a neutral point is slack 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.860
 then it wears us down when you do 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 movement in the catch enters us 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.180
 dirt and there is no solution there 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.820
 change the fork in this way it 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.159
 You can keep the fork because 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 only is at those points while it is not 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.070
 of open bathroom that there is no loss of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.640
 oil 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.819
 the fork works perfectly and not 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.139
 we have to change it 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.459
 so this is I'm going to try it now and 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.459
 this is achieved with this tool 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.090
 this tool allows you to remove the move them 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.410
 and you can do all these 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.780
 variations in this fork before 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.610
 throw it away because here they did not give answers 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.300
 to the official service nothing more than 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.360
 change it 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.760
 they are pretty quick I understand that they have 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.540
 to give a guarantee but that I have 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.849
 tried then we can see it here now and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.660
 although only with the two castles 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.650
 original 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.650
 I had slack 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.920
 and now at no point of all the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.110
 fork travel is now 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.350
 because it has three points of support 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.130
 and although it is 10 millimeters the intermediate 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.660
 in this type of forks that have 30 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.120
 millimeters two caps 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.850
 it's more than enough since there's 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.170
 many hairpins that come only with 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.350
 two caps of 15 millimeters or less 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.810
 then we go more than enough 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.440
 and I said so here is the extract 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 of seve 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.300
 it's very simple to use it can not be 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.350
 anyone have seen the videos 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.110
 this would be the third video that would be a 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.420
 repair from the replacement of 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.710
 caps that are the originals and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.560
 no wear is a lot more 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.710
 simple but that's how you can do it 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.800
 a neurology restoration and nothing there 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.630
 you have what I tell you my mail for 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.750
 any question there I take the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.350
 measures of the heights of the caps 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.300
 to have notes and have 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.140
 information if you have to do it again 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:09.030
 another in this case a record 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.010
 then let's say in this when it's a 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.350
 that you have never done because you have to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.000
 go very carefully adjusting but 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.859
 example since this one is made then 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.810
 you have the measurements 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.970
 and you can do a lot easier 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.879
 much faster we are doing it with him 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.699
 with machining 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:33.349
 and that's it because nothing there you have my mail 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.349
 from what is said come good you know
