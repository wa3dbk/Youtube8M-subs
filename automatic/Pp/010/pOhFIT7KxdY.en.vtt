00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
them that kind of raised your Mac off of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
them that kind of raised your Mac off of
the<00:01:35.430> service<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.180> actually<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.960> has

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the service and this one actually it has

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
the service and this one actually it has
a<00:01:37.110> satin<00:01:37.560> feel<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> feels<00:01:38.280> really

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
a satin feel to it so it feels really

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.020 
a satin feel to it so it feels really
nice<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.150> smooth<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:40.610> have<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
nice and smooth it does have kind of a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
nice and smooth it does have kind of a
little<00:01:42.210> raised<00:01:42.649> area<00:01:43.649> right<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:43.920> where<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
little raised area right here where you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
little raised area right here where you
can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> back<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.659> gives<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
can see in the back that gives you a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
can see in the back that gives you a
nice<00:01:46.140> typing<00:01:46.649> angle<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.040> well<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.430> you're

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
nice typing angle as well when you're

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.330 
nice typing angle as well when you're
using<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.630> Mac<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.770> other<00:01:49.890> thing<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
using the Mac the other thing that I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.130 
using the Mac the other thing that I
also<00:01:50.640> find<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.630> doesn't<00:01:51.930> really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
also find is that it doesn't really

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
also find is that it doesn't really
interfere<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.770> any<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> venting<00:01:53.579> which

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
interfere with any of the venting which

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.270 
interfere with any of the venting which
is<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.180> important<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.899> happens<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
is really important that happens on the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
is really important that happens on the
Mac<00:01:56.460> books<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.869> want<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
Mac books you you really don't want to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.130 
Mac books you you really don't want to
cover<00:01:58.439> anything<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.840> actual<00:02:00.840> Mac

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
cover anything up where your actual Mac

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.200 
cover anything up where your actual Mac
Book<00:02:01.350> would<00:02:01.500> overheat<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> case

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
Book would overheat that's not the case

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
Book would overheat that's not the case
with<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.140> also<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> ports

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
with this you also have all the ports

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.399 
with this you also have all the ports
are<00:02:05.579> exposed<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> accessible<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.200> and

are exposed and accessible you know and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.400 
are exposed and accessible you know and
this<00:02:07.500> literally<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.099> snaps<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.929> has<00:02:10.170> on

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this literally just snaps on it has on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.780 
this literally just snaps on it has on
this<00:02:10.590> side<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.950> show<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> same

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
this side if I show you here the same

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.220 
this side if I show you here the same
thing<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> true<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.599> have

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
thing is true so you have

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.660 
thing is true so you have
my<00:02:13.379> port<00:02:13.709> stowe<00:02:13.890> available<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.340> doesn't

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
my port stowe available it doesn't

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.839 
my port stowe available it doesn't
interfere<00:02:14.879> with<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.269> charger<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.580> all<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.760> all

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
interfere with my charger and all in all

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.280 
interfere with my charger and all in all
it's<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> great<00:02:18.299> little<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.110> great

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it's a great little it's a great

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.289 
it's a great little it's a great
addition<00:02:19.530> especially<00:02:20.459> if<00:02:20.909> you're<00:02:21.060> looking<00:02:21.239> to

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
addition especially if you're looking to

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.699 
addition especially if you're looking to
give<00:02:21.420> somebody<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.810> gift<00:02:22.049> this<00:02:22.290> would<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.650> they

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
give somebody a gift this would and they

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.320 
give somebody a gift this would and they
already<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.129> Mac<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.819> know<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
already have a Mac and you know it and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.210 
already have a Mac and you know it and
they<00:02:24.510> have<00:02:24.690> either<00:02:24.810> MacBook<00:02:25.260> Pro<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.650> MacBook

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
they have either MacBook Pro or MacBook

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.430 
they have either MacBook Pro or MacBook
Air<00:02:26.519> it'd<00:02:26.940> be<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> great<00:02:27.330> add-on<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:28.110> give<00:02:28.230> them

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
Air it'd be a great add-on to give them

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.289 
Air it'd be a great add-on to give them
now<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.430> I'll<00:02:29.519> show<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.910> how<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> install

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
now what I'll show you is how to install

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.670 
now what I'll show you is how to install
the<00:02:30.599> top<00:02:30.810> sheet<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.410> kind<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the top sheet because it's kind of

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.559 
the top sheet because it's kind of
tricky<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.030> things<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.420> I'll

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
tricky one of the things that I'll

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.360 
tricky one of the things that I'll
highlight<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.920> there<00:02:35.160> are<00:02:35.280> these

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
highlight here is that there are these

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.039 
highlight here is that there are these
little<00:02:35.700> clips<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:37.470> kind<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.459> snap<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
little clips that kind of snap on to

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.770 
little clips that kind of snap on to
prevent<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.400> cover<00:02:41.790> from<00:02:42.030> coming<00:02:42.360> off<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
prevent this cover from coming off and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.839 
prevent this cover from coming off and
there's<00:02:43.260> actually<00:02:43.709> two<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> them<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.730> each

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
there's actually two of them on each

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.119 
there's actually two of them on each
side<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.599> then<00:02:46.049> there<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.349> one<00:02:46.560> also<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
side and then there is one also on the

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.670 
side and then there is one also on the
top<00:02:47.400> which<00:02:47.940> may<00:02:48.150> be<00:02:48.209> hard<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> see<00:02:48.989> distinguish

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
top which may be hard to see distinguish

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.130 
top which may be hard to see distinguish
but<00:02:49.829> there's<00:02:49.980> also<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.519> right<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.989> what

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
but there's also one right here so what

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.839 
but there's also one right here so what
I<00:02:52.170> found<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:52.950> when<00:02:53.220> I'm<00:02:53.459> trying<00:02:53.609> to

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
I found is that when I'm trying to

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.009 
I found is that when I'm trying to
install<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.299> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> Mac<00:02:56.750> placing<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.870> this

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
install this on the Mac placing it this

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.930 
install this on the Mac placing it this
way<00:02:58.260> I'll<00:02:58.709> put<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.069> way<00:02:59.250> placing<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.910> just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
way I'll put it this way placing it just

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.750 
way I'll put it this way placing it just
on<00:03:00.269> top<00:03:00.480> doesn't<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.349> work<00:03:01.620> even<00:03:02.310> placing

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
on top doesn't really work even placing

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.099 
on top doesn't really work even placing
an<00:03:02.910> angle<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.540> kind<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.840> trying<00:03:04.079> to

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
an angle like this and kind of trying to

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.619 
an angle like this and kind of trying to
snap<00:03:04.379> it<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.859> doesn't<00:03:05.220> work<00:03:05.340> either<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:05.849> the

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
snap it in it doesn't work either so the

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.839 
snap it in it doesn't work either so the
best<00:03:06.870> way<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.079> install<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.829> is<00:03:08.010> by<00:03:08.430> slipping

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
that it's there so now as I slide down

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.720 
that it's there so now as I slide down
that<00:03:39.030> will<00:03:39.780> maintain<00:03:40.019> its<00:03:40.470> position<00:03:40.669> all<00:03:41.669> the

that will maintain its position all the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.599 
that will maintain its position all the
way<00:03:42.299> down<00:03:42.750> until<00:03:43.139> it<00:03:43.859> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.099> snaps<00:03:44.340> into

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
way down until it kind of snaps into

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.870 
way down until it kind of snaps into
position<00:03:44.819> let's<00:03:45.690> go<00:03:45.900> ahead<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:47.069> bring<00:03:47.730> it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
position let's go ahead and bring it

down all the way and you know going
pretty<00:03:52.319> snug<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.769> don't<00:03:52.950> worry<00:03:53.099> about<00:03:53.250> it

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
pretty snug so don't worry about it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.319 
pretty snug so don't worry about it
and<00:03:54.930> by<00:03:55.169> doing<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:55.919> you'll<00:03:56.430> notice<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
and by doing it now you'll notice that

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.339 
and by doing it now you'll notice that
again<00:03:58.169> it's<00:03:58.739> pretty<00:03:59.040> nice<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.370> flush<00:04:00.349> really

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
again it's pretty nice and flush really

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.729

the top portion also locked in alright

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.589 
the top portion also locked in alright
and<00:04:04.950> then<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.549> have<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.060> same<00:04:06.239> thing<00:04:06.419> on<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
and then you have the same thing on the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.559 
and then you have the same thing on the
side<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.049> it's<00:04:07.500> cotton<00:04:07.889> nicely<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.299> you'll

couldn't figure out how to put the cover

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.740 
couldn't figure out how to put the cover
the<00:04:17.220> bottom<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.639> pretty<00:04:17.880> easy<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.180> snaps<00:04:18.570> on

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
for the life of me I can't get

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.559 
for the life of me I can't get
I<00:04:21.829> had<00:04:22.340> even<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:22.610> friend<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.449> actually

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:23.569 
I had even one friend that actually

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.200 
I had even one friend that actually
snapped<00:04:24.139> one<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.069> these<00:04:25.190> little<00:04:25.669> clips<00:04:26.030> right

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
snapped one of these little clips right

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.360 
snapped one of these little clips right
here<00:04:26.479> as<00:04:26.659> they<00:04:26.780> were<00:04:26.870> trying<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.229> get<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.590> on<00:04:27.740> so

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
here as they were trying to get it on so

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.469 
here as they were trying to get it on so
again<00:04:28.879> it's<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> $49<00:04:30.490> item<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.879> really<00:04:32.180> want<00:04:32.330> to

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
again it's a $49 item you really want to

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.930 
again it's a $49 item you really want to
be<00:04:32.629> careful<00:04:33.409> when<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.770> install<00:04:34.129> it<00:04:34.310> but

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
be careful when you install it but

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.100 
be careful when you install it but
there's<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.210> right<00:04:35.389> wing<00:04:35.599> there's<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.870> wrong<00:04:36.080> way

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
there's a right wing there's a wrong way

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.529 
there's a right wing there's a wrong way
and<00:04:36.319> as<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:36.889> see<00:04:36.949> the<00:04:37.610> right<00:04:37.789> way<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.300> just

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
and as you can see the right way it just

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.749 
and as you can see the right way it just
slides<00:04:38.750> on<00:04:38.930> easily<00:04:39.470> but<00:04:40.009> I<00:04:40.039> guess<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:40.610> not

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
slides on easily but I guess it's not

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.629 
slides on easily but I guess it's not
that<00:04:40.909> obvious<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:41.930> highly<00:04:42.590> recommend<00:04:43.069> this

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
that obvious so highly recommend this

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.249 
that obvious so highly recommend this
case<00:04:43.970> or<00:04:44.750> cover<00:04:45.169> for<00:04:45.680> your<00:04:46.039> Mac<00:04:46.750> little<00:04:47.750> not

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
case or cover for your Mac little not

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.920 
case or cover for your Mac little not
not<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.740> cheapest<00:04:49.150> accessory<00:04:50.150> but<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.659> think

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
not the cheapest accessory but I think

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.300 
not the cheapest accessory but I think
it's<00:04:51.050> it's<00:04:51.319> the<00:04:51.470> best<00:04:51.680> accessory<00:04:52.129> you<00:04:52.280> can

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
it's it's the best accessory you can

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.059 
it's it's the best accessory you can
have<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:53.300> protect<00:04:53.659> the<00:04:54.289> finish<00:04:54.469> of<00:04:54.740> your<00:04:54.770> Mac
