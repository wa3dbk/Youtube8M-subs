00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.790
 Hello everyone, today we see something 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.880
 quite simple though you hear me 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.610
 asked several times it is practically yes 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.590
 we are talking about the radio is both of 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.599
 this radio here that in short that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.040
 you buy then aftermarket 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.869
 we will also see how how to remove the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.759
 radio the original one let's say 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.110
 beginning precisely from this for 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.800
 take this radio down here we have 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.829
 I need these two, I don't know how 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.690
 call them extractors are included in the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.000
 packaging and nothing is needed 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.019
 of course to extract the radio from 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.120
 own office 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.300
 now let's see how to use them 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.070
 then to remove the radio and we can 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.839
 leave this frame no need 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.949
 to remove it if we want instead 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.480
 change it as i know we have to put back 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.710
 the original one for example to them 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.420
 we must also remove this frame 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.879
 obviously this frame comes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.740
 purchased on purpose for beauty by 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.050
 then put on what to do 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.760
 we take our two extractors as 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.729
 you see they have a rounded part we say it is 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.680
 a concave part must then be inserted 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.649
 in this way then the concave part 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.079
 goes to the radio and must be entered in 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.700
 this point you hope we do hand 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.540
 inserted at this point more or less at 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.549
 center is on one side 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.930
 also from this side concave part towards 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.149
 the interior ok with these extractors of 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.700
 send to act on the hooks that 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.259
 they hold the radio in place here 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.539
 we have to expand these hooks and 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.200
 then pull it away at the same time 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.240
 we push even further inside 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 here he is now he has made the shot 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.659
 then went to open whose the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.420
 hook do the same thing from 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.340
 this side 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.890
 ok so right now we have 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 open the hooks and you need practically 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.539
 once opened hooks needed 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.399
 move these extractors a little 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.729
 downwards upwards 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.470
 see you so that you can do 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.890
 take and take out the radio is that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:25.450
 that moves 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.709
 sometimes they run away here it wants one 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.860
 once extracted naturally you can 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.250
 removing them you can finish taking it out a 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.590
 hand obviously once the network 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.579
 stratta be careful of the cables behind 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 not pulling them had to free them and yes 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:46.239
 go to set up the prefect's ok 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.750
 these are the various cables and that's it 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:55.359
 we extracted our radio from 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.209
 its seat we detach the plug there is a 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:04.209
 kind of key to press we press e 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:07.090
 we pull off missing the antella is the same 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.849
 in all our radio we can 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.620
 go and put another new one or I don't know 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.989
 if you just wanted to check the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.599
 fuses rather than to make gods 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:27.130
 crazy jobs fairies and the going to 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:35.859
 put back in a pin we put back 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:40.690
 the antenna we insert the cables so that 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:43.709
 precisely that they are not designed there 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.709
 we push in with mom 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.510
 insert the radio inside and insert it 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.000
 we push in if you feel that it is strong 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.290
 that can no longer go inside 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.580
 pull it out again and settle down 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.070
 better the cables because obviously it is 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.350
 by pressing on the cables really up to 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.350
 bottom he goes to fit again 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.320
 here you are feeling the clubs that are i 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.480
 hooks that are going to fit together and you have 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.000
 put the radio back in an upcoming video 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.890
 we will then see the original radio nothing 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.420
 this video is all thank you 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.420
 of course the vision to the next 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.980
 insert the plug 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.170
 that makes it work that can't go anymore 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.850
 in, pull it out again and 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.490
 never arrange the cables because then in mind 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.210
 it was just pressing on the cables nothing 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.210
 allows it all the way 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:54.150
 and in fact pressed all the way down 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.740
 you fear to the end he goes to 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.740
 fit again 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.380
 done
