00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.920
 huge range all dear friends with you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.460
 1up and today we'll talk about hard 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.880
 soviet tank of the fifth level kv-1 and i 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 I will show you a visual fight which 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.210
 demonstrates all his possibilities 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.240
 namely kv-1 forgives almost all 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.010
 errors on it can even bend 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.279
 inexperienced player and do it very 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.179
 just put gas nny drone and peel 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.759
 absolutely for all on the digger I play 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.340
 here in this battle the third time if you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.559
 think that how is it that you have one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 there is also a tes 4 circuit somehow could not play 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.079
 on whom there is no I passed this thread yet 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 a long time ago when the KV-1 tank was not 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.010
 tank to in on the fifth level of his scam 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 most anal and random he was a fugashni I 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.289
 was not a nerve linay then Serb 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.300
 there was no gold he didnâ€™t shoot the bullets 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 only by land mines of night it was possible 107 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.239
 meter gun put in general in those 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.880
 times he poked was fun and all that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.810
 but what now is 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 tank kv-1 in general for the fifth level 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.960
 Tank very nagibuchy here certainly he 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.040
 very very many bush and came to 28 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.659
 just one landmine and he's already in the hangar 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.900
 no unnecessary words of yoga sinner 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.020
 exclamations 320 they have already played can not 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.770
 break through the cumulative bomb with breakdown 140 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 not for oil cumulative with breakdown 140 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.530
 which sew almost all the tanks with which 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.009
 you fall into battle before the high-explosive cannon is not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.810
 very apt but so what can you 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.409
 fulfill the weak point you can at least 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.420
 to break through a blow like a high explosive 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 h61 guys this is enough to punch 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.450
 all small tanks to us 4 levels 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.719
 lower actually it is very cool 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.969
 the tank is really embody to imba on 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.009
 level five bend on it all even 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.399
 inexperienced players simply because 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.439
 put a high-explosive trend and forgive everything i 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.489
 I am silent about the German type tanks 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.250
 Nasher on nashorna or there this barrel 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.799
 German or something else storming 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.530
 do you guys know that they can 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.700
 oppose the Soviet land mines bottom 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.950
 so here in this fight I did not play at all 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.870
 prospector didn't do anything on 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.150
 minimap almost never watched 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.700
 stream read the comments answered them 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.959
 I went up a lot in general 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 played like a typical 43 percent so what 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.370
 from that score 75 three frags and already almost 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.769
 1000 damage is on the fifth level 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.160
 i keep pushing moving on the enemy 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.470
 base until a little bit you can see that our base 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.799
 can push but look what 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.069
 the accumulation of ours there yes there principle 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.569
 sisters 267 orton damn it will go something 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.790
 same they can do on the cottage with everyone 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.549
 women okay at least art 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.680
 do something in the meantime enemy 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.620
 art very well defended and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.870
 already takes a lot of ours now 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.959
 illustrative example 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.609
 leaves enemy hettser 270 x I 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.620
 recharge on kum il to be 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.810
 guaranteed vanchot I want to note that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.380
 Kul has average damage 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.970
 Already three hundred seventy fifth level I think 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.880
 everyone knows what it is 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.769
 hedger played with one cumulative 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.720
 then you can go to land mines because 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.049
 what is nothing black with this art 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.609
 can you do anything 4 enemies already have 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.380
 left 3 arteries that which itself 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.560
 themselves are based on nothing so much as life and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.230
 even open quickly died so 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.909
 slowly heading towards not 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.819
 trick someone first yet in that 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.890
 landmines punch his artillery can not 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.390
 at least so fine leveled 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.430
 sphere that falls with us in will 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.190
 will punch him altogether almost not 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.349
 Do you need a wild luck to jump 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.049
 the art hit the roof also pierced 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.510
 so you can live here too 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.930
 and the mobility of the kv-1 is not really 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.329
 the worst thing is worse so 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.810
 here, too, everything is quite good in general 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.180
 guys someone will choose kvass cooks kv-1 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.489
 I personally will take apt-1 because there 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.459
 it is also possible to board the tank can 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.760
 put a diamond in general such a set 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.580
 avid from this water all as you like 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.090
 full information does not break the bomb you 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.699
 put mouth 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.410
 I put on the tracks now again 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.260
 again complete information 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.389
 guys I'm not given to him because why am I 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.850
 already reading the comments calmly put 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.210
 on capture from a real fight very much 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.400
 uporolsya played, I did not know how it is not 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.039
 I left myself still on capture 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.970
 because no way it was exactly playing 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:56.639
 on square-1 and did not want to move too much and 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.620
 so much better calmly stand by 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.590
 more so that the rate rises like a pillow 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.220
 from capturing the base but so here's the guys what 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.660
 i have it all 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.970
 this apt-1 tank is one of the few tanks 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.970
 who forgives you almost all 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.010
 mistakes on his feet except what you need 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.720
 to play for no good at all 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.700
 bring the team if you are any 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.560
 know how to think and know how little 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.919
 move well as an example I'm in this fight 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.130
 I played I did not do anything special on 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.139
 art now I frankly slept up 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.729
 the guard without a pig shot of course 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.780
 I 've never been lucky with the guard 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.780
 so attempt number 2 is also from the floor 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.270
 the guard 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.220
 it is not clear where the projectile flew off okay 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.840
 It turned out that I play with the server 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.730
 a sight I was there on it orients 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.090
 it seemed to be normal but missed again and 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.320
 again guys uporotyh that further forward 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.510
 artilleryman he had this leave 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.940
 upright shot ortiz come 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:00.520
 boarding what do you think he will not break through 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:02.950
 that nezachto 130 I do not know how this tank 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.280
 do not need to be able to at least bend 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.220
 on apt-1 it is very easy to handle 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.380
 tank certainly therefore their opinions 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.330
 write in the comments and do not start 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.310
 of course subscribe to my channel and 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.040
 like this because you know 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.680
 best reward and if you want to help 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.620
 channel then watch the video without sound 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.600
 and on it all good luck to you in fights to rot and 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.600
 on all tanks and happily
