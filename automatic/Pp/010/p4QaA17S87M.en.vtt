00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 this is a video tutorial that I want 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.649
 sharing with you is a trick in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.990
 photoshop suddenly some already know 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.019
 others not good for those who do not 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.509
 we know it true 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.939
 it's a pretty simple trick those 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.970
 We are dedicated to making carnets or 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:24.330
 credentials to print them later on in 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.100
 the epson t 50 printer 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 so we like the design in 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.100
 photoshop 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.320
 that is a template in photoshop that 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.840
 they say 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.770
 I have to design other templates in 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.770
 illustrator 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.270
 some other programs that support 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.130
 designs for re templates for these 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.739
 for these programs for these 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.230
 impressions ok those who need 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.239
 this template I leave the mail in the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.070
 description of this video so that I 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.820
 I write gladly the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.920

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.850
 very important that please point at 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.250
 our videos is the way to 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.909
 contribute or is the way to compensate 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.900
 give us the gift that we do it and 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.350
 compensate these videos that we 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.540
 we do for you ok already with this 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.360
 brief description then then 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.230
 we do in matter let's say that many 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.700
 times we in this one 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.470
 this template 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.300
 of photoshop we want to make a 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 let's say that we select the tool 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.890
 ellipse here 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.890
 we want to make a design in this way 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.090
 the ellipse covers a part of the card 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.979
 but it happens that here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.060
 we only want this part 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.060
 that I'm traveling here with 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.250
 in internet closing 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.960
 and what we have left here causes us 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.619
 two problems first this is going to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.819
 print on the card tray 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.920
 so no 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.099
 will stain the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 the tray and second is going to spend us 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.110
 true ink because by printing this 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.630
 outside 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.090
 consume ink then this save 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.150
 ink and that's why we 're going to do 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.800
 a cut of this true although here what 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.800
 I have left colorless 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.490
 ellipses let's put color 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.250
 although we are going to this part here where 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.320
 it says color we click there and it comes out 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.060
 this window we choose a color 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.760
 any true 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.069
 the exercise does not serve this color now 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.550
 well when are we going to do a 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.550
 cutout 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.080
 we need to visualize accurately 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.180
 license 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.110
 the limit of the card 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.630
 and cutting what the part 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 ellipse that will serve us therefore 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.810
 we are going here 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.810
 here where it says form 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.720
 we select 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.130
 here where it says opacity 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.740
 Opacity may be a 30 to 25% 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.310
 true so that if we look here already 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.390
 do not 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.390
 to visualize 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.190
 the limit line 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.720
 for that we are going to choose here 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.890
 let's go to the toolbar here 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.890
 this tool that is 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.269
 the pen tool was that I wanted 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.980
 show them here with the pen tool 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.959
 we are going to make a cut 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.530
 to select everything we do not want 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.760
 to be printed 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.760
 before starting 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.719
 the selection of the part that we want 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.190
 remove us go again to our 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.710
 cap 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.170
 where we have the figure 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.260
 to our layers panel we select 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.520
 the layer and we right click and go 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.610
 here where it says mastering layer 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.090
 there is already raking the layer 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.190
 then we proceed to do 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.710
 the choice of the part 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.510
 we click with him 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.460
 the pen k 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.380
 and we are doing another click here another 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.380
 point so that they go joining true 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.099
 make precise I'm going to do it here 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:55.639
 fast way we are locking everything 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.639
 that we do not want 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.630
 print what 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.150
 when we get here, look here in 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.150
 the cursor 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.889
 something in this in 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.719
 first click where you start appears 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.880
 next there is a circle that tells us that 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:20.040
 there when clicking it will enclose part 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.100
 there is selected this is the part 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.560
 what do we want to eliminate 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.180
 once we are there inside the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.570
 part that we are going to eliminate we click on 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.050
 right and we select make selection 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.509
 here 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.300
 selection although this appears 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:40.319
 pop-up window that says interpret 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.229
 the radius of fade here we put you 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.060
 two pixels enough with two pixels 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.039
 australes suddenly appears one two three 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.259
 four six those who are please 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.720
 we put two the rest we leave it there 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.870
 like this one 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.950
 perfect and we give ok 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.950
 we have already 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.960
 we 're going to our keyboard and 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.440
 we select the delete key we give 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.810
 Click there 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.640
 some have the delete key which is what 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.640
 DLT same and it is literally ok 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.640
 removed 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.150
 It was true later to remove 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.600
 this selection we go to our keyboard 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.800
 again and we put control of the 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.800
 control + keys 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.880
 Then look what has already been here 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:41.150
 although these parts can be eliminated 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.150
 it was true these leftovers here 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.480
 It is useful for designs in our 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.480
 cards 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.490
 it's photoshop 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:56.040
 once we've finished this 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.650
 we go again to our 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.040
 our layer 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.800
 we go back and we leave the opacity in 100 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.800
 so that the color 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.800
 Y 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.870

 for us the engineers that we 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.840
