conditioning<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.400> cod4<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
conditioning from cod4 so you don't have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 
conditioning from cod4 so you don't have
unlimited<00:01:12.990> sprint<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.210> run<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
lot longer my middle perk i believe is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
lot longer my middle perk i believe is
steady<00:01:19.140> aim<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.280> me<00:01:20.310> using<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
steady aim and here you see me using the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.499

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
i'm sure they'll fix that before the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
i'm sure they'll fix that before the
full<00:01:28.530> game<00:01:28.680> comes<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.610> you'll<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.659> i

full game comes out but as you'll see i
mean<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:31.829> time<00:01:31.950> i<00:01:32.100> use

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
mean like this is the first time i use

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
mean like this is the first time i use
it<00:01:32.720> it's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.900> three<00:01:34.320> kill<00:01:34.530> streak<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.750> get

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it it's a three kill streak so you get

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
it it's a three kill streak so you get
it<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> three<00:01:37.380> kills<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.430> unlimited

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it up to three kills and it's unlimited

it up to three kills and it's unlimited
you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.450> as<00:01:39.570> long<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:41.009> takes<00:01:42.290> which

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you can go for as long as it takes which

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
you can go for as long as it takes which
in<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.799> opinion<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
in my opinion it out there it's kind of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
in my opinion it out there it's kind of
bugging<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:46.259> bit

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
bugging out a little bit little bit

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.740 
bugging out a little bit little bit
their<00:01:46.619> own<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.820> opinion<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.420> little

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
their own in my opinion that's a little

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.090 
their own in my opinion that's a little
bit<00:01:48.869> too<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.979> they

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
bit too much like I think that they

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.649 
bit too much like I think that they
should<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.149> time<00:01:51.329> limit<00:01:51.600> on

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
should put some kind of a time limit on

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.319 
should put some kind of a time limit on
it<00:01:51.720> maybe<00:01:51.930> 15<00:01:52.380> minutes<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> first

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
it maybe 15 minutes this is the first

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.639 
it maybe 15 minutes this is the first
time<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.509> had<00:01:54.720> ever<00:01:54.750> pulled<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.439> kill

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
time I had ever pulled out this kill

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
time I had ever pulled out this kill
streak<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.579> didn't<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.850> how

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
streak and so I really didn't know how

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240 
streak and so I really didn't know how
to<00:01:57.060> handle<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.740> gave<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to handle it and I just gave up and I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.350 
to handle it and I just gave up and I
pulled<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> trigger<00:01:59.790> because<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.030> wanted<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
pulled the trigger because I wanted to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.990 
pulled the trigger because I wanted to
get<00:02:00.450> back<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> game<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> set<00:02:02.880> off

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
get back in the game so you you set off

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
get back in the game so you you set off
the<00:02:03.030> explosion<00:02:03.829> by<00:02:04.829> hitting<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> right

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the explosion by hitting the right

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.359 
the explosion by hitting the right
trigger<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> you're<00:02:05.909> good<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> go<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.099> chose

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
trigger and you're good to go so I chose

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.309 
trigger and you're good to go so I chose
to<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> famas<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> which<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.020> fully

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to use the famas for this which is fully

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
to use the famas for this which is fully
automatic<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.009> game<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.489> really

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
automatic in this game because I really

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.770 
automatic in this game because I really
wanted<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.750> aggressive

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
wanted to get in there and be aggressive

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.690 
wanted to get in there and be aggressive
and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.670 
and
get<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> handle<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> map<00:02:15.080> before<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.470> did

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
get a handle on the map before I did

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.110 
get a handle on the map before I did
anything<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:16.069> try<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.489> sniping<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.030> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
anything like try and sniping and it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.670 
anything like try and sniping and it
ended<00:02:17.360> up<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.900> entire<00:02:18.140> night<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.410> basically

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
ended up the entire night I basically

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.820 
ended up the entire night I basically
avoided<00:02:19.519> sniping<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.470> don't<00:02:21.680> know

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
avoided sniping because if I don't know

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.070 
avoided sniping because if I don't know
map<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.430> not<00:02:22.700> really<00:02:22.970> going<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.300> like<00:02:23.480> try<00:02:23.959> and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
map I'm not really going to like try and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.330 
map I'm not really going to like try and
run<00:02:24.200> around<00:02:24.290> with<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.620> sniper<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.069> here<00:02:28.250> you

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
run around with a sniper and so here you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.920 
run around with a sniper and so here you
see<00:02:28.430> me<00:02:28.550> pick<00:02:28.790> up<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.000> light<00:02:29.150> machine<00:02:29.450> gun<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
see me pick up a light machine gun and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.470 
see me pick up a light machine gun and
if<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.040> go<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.489> go<00:02:31.610> back<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.970> famas<00:02:32.209> but

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
if you go and I go back to the famas but

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.120 
if you go and I go back to the famas but
if<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.690> guys<00:02:32.780> notice<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.260> guns<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.620> recoil

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
if you guys notice the guns have recoil

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.350

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
asking about the snipers and even though

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.960 
asking about the snipers and even though
I<00:02:59.420> didn't<00:02:59.750> play<00:02:59.900> it<00:02:59.989> I<00:03:00.049> will<00:03:00.200> tell<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.470> that

I didn't play it I will tell you that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.220 
I didn't play it I will tell you that
when<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> was<00:03:02.120> watching<00:03:02.239> other<00:03:02.569> people<00:03:02.840> play<00:03:02.870> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
when I was watching other people play it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.600 
when I was watching other people play it
didn't<00:03:03.530> look<00:03:03.620> too<00:03:03.829> hard<00:03:04.010> for<00:03:04.099> them<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.340> get<00:03:04.549> a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
didn't look too hard for them to get a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.280 
didn't look too hard for them to get a
one<00:03:04.790> shot<00:03:04.970> kill<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.840> break<00:03:06.019> up<00:03:06.140> this

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
one shot kill I have to break up this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.690 
one shot kill I have to break up this
video<00:03:06.470> because<00:03:06.829> we<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.160> only<00:03:07.250> show<00:03:07.459> three

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
video because we can only show three

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.210 
video because we can only show three
minutes<00:03:07.940> at<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> time<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:09.769> is<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.010> first

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
minutes at a time so this is the first

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.480 
minutes at a time so this is the first
video<00:03:10.370> stay<00:03:10.700> tuned<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.090> next<00:03:11.239> one
