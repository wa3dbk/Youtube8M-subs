00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.540
 I was not looking for the actor of the portal so cittÃ .it 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.319
 and I made this video 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.599
 petrus mind of puttilli information 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.530
 to make the most of the potential of things and cities 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.439
 lion quote for your recommendations at the search engines 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.069
 we hear about the gloul edigit search window I love the word corsets 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 we will notice that courses in the city is in first place compared facets 42 million 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.239
 direct 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.839
 this means that for woonko 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.690
 the best information to be transmitted made p linked to the keyword 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.379
 racing 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.770
 it provides toxicity portal. 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.380
 in the same way, if we associate the word, ran the name of a city 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
 Italian suppose roma 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.650
 we will notice that courses in the city is in first place on about 5 and a half million 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.980
 we now enter the reserved area 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.870
 in the portal corsincittÃ  I thought of entering the data relating to ours 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.030
 schools aspects we click on button arezzo 8 we type our lol. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 our password yahoo 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.510
 which allows a contraction window to open 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.830
 the inclusion that are changes to new school cox on me 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.250
 click on edit school 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.750
 I was thinking of entering data about our school in windows 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.550
 prepacked 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.940
 once filled and all these windows I leave the cows 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.660
 and now we begin to insert two boxes 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.080
 click on the new course window 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.630
 another window will open with me in the field 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.300
 ready-made 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.610
 where is killa first field concerns the name of the hill under the title of the cox 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.000
 and the reason we talked about a little while ago will always have to fit into this 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.050
 field can the word courses occurred 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 the name of the city where they are held 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.670
 suppose we have to go and follow a painting course 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.090
 organized by the art school of the time 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.240
 father but digital 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.209
 courses 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.209
 painting 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.160
 we will go to position 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.940
 this place in the relevant category in this case we have the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.929
 the whole category 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.730
 we will go 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.890
 we continue 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.019
 to compile pre-packaged spicy foods 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.839
 you get to camp with you 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.789
 this field contained in the head extremely important for 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.789
 indexing of our search engine course 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.809
 first thing to do copy the course title 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.969
 it is positioned in the first line of the short field 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.269
 these functional to lerici 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.499
 after that 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.109
 to implement the text of this chapter we must follow a strategy 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.159
 I'm not an organizer of painting courses I wrote a text that I think 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.159
 is functional for pepper indexing 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.329
 this painting course 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.650
 is carried out at our Rome office 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.050
 easily reachable also by public transport bolzano dico 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.879
 the teachers 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.249
 they are expert teachers in pictorial art 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.060
 technical skills for watercolor painting will be transmitted 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:18.629
 oil and desert painting 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.189
 moreover the various materials used in painting will be known 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.010
 and the knowledge of the chromatic gradations of the colors will allow to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 make your own paintings 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.319
 enhancing your imagination 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.099
 you will discover the pleasure of painting the satisfaction that transmits the 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.389
 realization of the pictorial work 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.969
 conceived and performed totally by itself using the artistic side that each one 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.119
 of us possesses but not always succeeds at head 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.739
 this field can of course be enlarged and that way of the fourth is also the 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:49.990
 beautiful needs 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.139
 of the course 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.869
 however what I emphasize is the frequency I used in the 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.579
 re-propose the key words of interest I ran 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.759
 painting 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.579
 for this reason also combined with the other keywords contained semantic threads 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.680
 to the identified keywords 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.030
 and therefore these also contribute 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.190
 to position me first places of the search engines that are precisely the offspring 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.070
 teaching teachers the word tel pictorial the word art the proof 4 la 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.069
 word paint 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.459
 therefore words that have their own strategy for their function 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.330
 this you have to repeat me for anything that has to be organized 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.979
 that I run discount painting languages 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.029
 of sculpture of marketing and communication 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:39.910
 it doesn't matter where to always repopulate 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.919
 a frequency of repetition density of strategic keywords e 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.379
 to Italy 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.949
 with this term the first part of this video course continues with the 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.209
 the second part with which we will discuss how these do not 

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.619
 interest
