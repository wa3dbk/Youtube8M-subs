show we're in the original run with
their<00:01:56.369> robots<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.960> maybe

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
their robots so I don't know if maybe

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
their robots so I don't know if maybe
we're<00:01:59.219> gonna<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.729> like<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.210> flashback<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:01.259> a

we're gonna be like a flashback or a
brand<00:02:02.040> new<00:02:02.250> crop<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.729> robot<00:02:03.450> Butler's<00:02:03.719> because

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
brand new crop of robot Butler's because

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020 
brand new crop of robot Butler's because
of<00:02:04.140> course<00:02:04.350> technology<00:02:04.950> has<00:02:05.490> changed<00:02:05.520> very

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
of course technology has changed very

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210 
of course technology has changed very
much<00:02:06.240> since<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> early<00:02:07.049> 00<00:02:07.229> s<00:02:07.409> there<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.099> now

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
much since the early 00 s there are now

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.360 
much since the early 00 s there are now
3d<00:02:08.640> printers<00:02:09.119> I'm<00:02:09.509> excited<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.370> because

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
3d printers I'm excited to see because

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.640 
3d printers I'm excited to see because
now<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.150> mentioned<00:02:12.480> technology<00:02:12.930> changes<00:02:13.260> but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
now you mentioned technology changes but

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.380 
now you mentioned technology changes but
people<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.040> access<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.670> tiny<00:02:14.970> cameras<00:02:15.299> like

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
people have access to tiny cameras like

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.149 
people have access to tiny cameras like
the<00:02:15.420> GoPro<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.769> know<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> little

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
the GoPro and the you know the little

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.970 
the GoPro and the you know the little
tiny<00:02:17.370> cameras<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.480> how<00:02:18.930> exciting<00:02:19.349> would<00:02:19.439> be<00:02:19.709> I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
tiny cameras so how exciting would be I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.619 
tiny cameras so how exciting would be I
know<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.370> early<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.000> did<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.450> like

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
know I think early on they did have like

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.199 
know I think early on they did have like
povs<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.620> some<00:02:22.799> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> battle<00:02:23.250> bots<00:02:23.459> but

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
povs for some of the battle bots but

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.479 
povs for some of the battle bots but
they're<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.659> pretty<00:02:24.870> harsh<00:02:25.200> sure<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.280> now

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
they're like pretty harsh sure but now

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.949 
they're like pretty harsh sure but now
to<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:26.909> can<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> imagine<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.480> little<00:02:27.780> tiny

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
to have can you imagine like little tiny

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.839 
to have can you imagine like little tiny
cameras<00:02:28.379> they<00:02:28.590> put<00:02:29.159> there<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.700> can

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
cameras they put there and you can

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.910 
cameras they put there and you can
actually<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.989> fights<00:02:31.319> or<00:02:31.560> go<00:02:31.709> online

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
actually see the fights or go online

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.000 
actually see the fights or go online
after<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.609> fact<00:02:32.879> or<00:02:33.150> or<00:02:33.359> drones<00:02:33.840> yeah<00:02:34.470> drone

after the fact or or drones yeah drone
warfare<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.849> battle<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> my

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
warfare in the battle of my

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.899 
warfare in the battle of my
battlestation<00:02:37.680> battle<00:02:37.980> arena<00:02:38.220> an<00:02:38.459> aerial

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
battlestation battle arena an aerial

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.789 
battlestation battle arena an aerial
battle<00:02:38.939> I<00:02:39.480> mean<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.019> imagine<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.620> how

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
battle I mean can you imagine like how

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.830 
battle I mean can you imagine like how
exciting<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.180> gotta<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.599> water

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
exciting this is for gotta have water

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.569 
exciting this is for gotta have water
BOTS<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:43.739> gotta<00:02:43.920> do<00:02:44.129> something<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.519> the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
BOTS now they gotta do something in the

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.879 
BOTS now they gotta do something in the
water<00:02:44.730> yet<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.599> don't<00:02:45.720> has<00:02:45.989> water<00:02:46.319> know<00:02:46.680> that

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
water yet you don't has water know that

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.250 
water yet you don't has water know that
the<00:02:47.040> theory<00:02:47.310> could<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:48.989> okay

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the theory could this we can do okay

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
the theory could this we can do okay
yeah<00:02:49.470> something<00:02:49.739> with<00:02:49.829> magnets<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.459> because

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
yeah something with magnets to because

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.000 
yeah something with magnets to because
people<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.359> right<00:02:51.690> yeah<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.980> is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
people like that right yeah so this is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.059 
people like that right yeah so this is
coming<00:02:53.400> back<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.700> ebc<00:02:54.329> very<00:02:54.810> limited<00:02:55.319> not

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
coming back on ebc very limited not

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.270 
coming back on ebc very limited not
really<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.209> same<00:02:57.650> majan<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.769> not<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.189> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
really the same majan it's not going to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.979 
really the same majan it's not going to
have<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.879> Traci<00:03:00.150> Bingham<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.629> carmen

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
have like Traci Bingham and carmen

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.599 
have like Traci Bingham and carmen
electra<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.709> will<00:03:01.859> be<00:03:01.980> more

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
electra and it will be more

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.610 
electra and it will be more
technology-based<00:03:03.389> it's<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:03.989> conjecture

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
technology-based it's all conjecture

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.309 
technology-based it's all conjecture
girls<00:03:05.159> point<00:03:05.430> maybe<00:03:05.760> see<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.329> mean<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.750> think<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
girls point maybe see I mean I think you

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.319 
girls point maybe see I mean I think you
know<00:03:07.439> if<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.829> remember<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.790> challengers

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
know if you remember the the challengers

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.690 
know if you remember the the challengers
right<00:03:09.569> like<00:03:09.810> killa<00:03:10.290> amp<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.159> Vlad<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
right like killa amp to and Vlad the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.729 
right like killa amp to and Vlad the
Impaler<00:03:12.389> I<00:03:12.599> mean<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.349> like<00:03:13.379> a<00:03:13.500> show

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
Impaler I mean this is like a show

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.839 
Impaler I mean this is like a show
that's<00:03:13.980> that's<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.639> perfect

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
that's that's like the perfect

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.030 
that's that's like the perfect
intersection<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.590> computer

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
intersection of like computer

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.390 
intersection of like computer
programmers<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:17.879> uh<00:03:18.769> death<00:03:19.769> by<00:03:20.010> wrestling

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
programmers and uh death by wrestling

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.640 
programmers and uh death by wrestling
people<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.329> know<00:03:21.480> there's<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.319> that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
people you know there's like it's that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.900 
people you know there's like it's that
it's<00:03:22.829> that's<00:03:23.160> been<00:03:23.310> missing<00:03:23.459> from<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it's that's been missing from the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.640 
it's that's been missing from the
marketplace<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.870> long<00:03:25.079> I'm<00:03:25.379> just<00:03:25.530> so
