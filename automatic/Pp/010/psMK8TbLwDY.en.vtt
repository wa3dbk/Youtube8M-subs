00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.269
 very good everyone here fra solier in a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 video of the night ssp channel and we have 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.270
 here in this video a small tutorial 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.220
 how to make skulls with shotguns and eyes 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.769
 blue good as you can see 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 I am indeed a skull with eyes 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.710
 blue and shotguns good in the first 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.020
 part like being the blues good the eyes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 blue and the stripes that you see up to the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.790
 left of the emblem or shield as 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.090
 want to see it 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.940
 There are 5 at the most and each line gives it to you 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.490
 for every day played zombies that is in 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.310
 a period of 24 hours you have to have 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.430
 played a series of games I do not know the 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.100
 amount but I imagine it will be one or 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.080
 two of about 15 minutes with good 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.320
 result is not worth 180 to 10 deaths nor 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.900
 nothing like that a 180 12 deaths is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.580
 quite acceptable and you will end up giving 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.860
 the blue eyes on the prestige in the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.210
 you are but they will not give you the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 next prestige the next 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.700
 prestige is given by what we are going to 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.470
 see below 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.869
 but good for you to understand 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.479
 first let's look at the statistics 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.979
 that compose it and the first one is 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.290
 career statistics 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.840
 the other cooperatives statistics and the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.090
 another statistic is around here so 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.650
 You understand how the thing is going 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.770
 explain each of the statistics 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.930
 good career statistics is in 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.180
 theory the sum of the statistics 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.990
 cooperatives and statistics against 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.800
 here we have a pretty piece 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.980
 important 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.810
 and we will see below why 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.700
 cooperative statistics serve to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.050
 the games we play to 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.820
 Franco's survival because of good 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.520
 games with which we do not fight against 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.900
 another team is very important worth all 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.240
 survival even if you put yourself in 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.580
 personalized that keeps counting in 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.920
 cooperative statistics so the myth 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.830
 that of which you put in personalized that no 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.730
 you count for prestige in lying to 50 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.890
 and a lot because it adds to you 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 cooperative statistics 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.400
 good the statistics against which they are worth 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.530
 much less than statistics 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.920
 cooperatives but it's a very 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.590
 important to then the rate that we're going 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.060
 to see after 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.640
 are for games we play just 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.550
 converted and there's nothing else 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.150
 had and converted and good is not worth much 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.280
 like the cooperatives but it counts and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.650
 good to a lesser extent but it counts now 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.750
 you will see why the first thing that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.890
 we have to do are low rates 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.870
 in death of each of the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.750
 statistics that in this case like 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.950
 purchase does not have much to do we are going to 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.519
 catch nothing but statistics of 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.349
 career and cooperative statistics for 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.849
 know the low death rate of 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.310
 career statistics first we have 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.590
 that divide the casualties that is the circle 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 on the left among the dejected the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.739
 circle on the right to me I get a 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.099
 rate of 160 therefore should not 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.950
 be skull with shotguns but good 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.989
 now let's see that in the next in 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.049
 cooperative statistics the rate of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.460
 low death I get 220 you have to do the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.800
 same calculation 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.350
 the casualties on the left between 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.100
 knocked down to the right and gives me a rate 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.050
 of 220 well we want to do now 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.960
 catch the two houses low death of the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.540
 two statistics add them and divide them 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.580
 between two that will give us the rate of 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.590
 prestige that is what will serve to 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.200
 prestige 1 prestige to the next 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.380
 good level there I get a rate of 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.320
 prestige of 190 so yes I can 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.450
 be skull with shotguns from 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.850
 how much is the rate to be shotguns 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:03.070
 well it's not very clear but I imagine 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:08.020
 that 185 180 more or less I do not know for 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.290
 some is 180 for others 135 no no what 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.470
 I'm very clear but let's go with 185 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 so you pass safely 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.920
 well we can also know how many 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.230
 low we would need to enter 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.170
 shotgun prestige to have a 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.600
 mortgage good prestige rate like 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.650
 we have seen in cooperative statistics 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.980
 with the losses that I have, one gives me one 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.950
 low death rate of 220 and that rate of 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.100
 220 gives me a prestige rate of 190 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.470
 but let's imagine that by themes of 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.420
 the statistics against that are not worth more 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.160
 that cooperatives but that count 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:55.140
 Well, it turns out that my prestigious house 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.300
 180 therefore it would not be shotguns 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.160
 Well, we can do some calculations 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.680
 to calculate the losses that we 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.360
 would lack to have prestige of 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.280
 shotgun good here we have the calculation 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.730
 I'm going to apply it a little bit to see 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.100
 example the 220 that is the low rate 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.060
 death of cooperative statistics gives me 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.660
 180 of prestige rate 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.080
 because I need to know what this is down 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.590
 deaths I need to 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.180
 gm of 185 which is the prestige rate 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.800
 to be shotguns 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.740
 Well, we do the calculations you see 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.539
 down there would be the low death rate 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.930
 that you have right now in cooperative 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.659
 multiply it by the 185 that is the rate 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.620
 of prestige to make shotguns and 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:48.180
 divide it into 330 which is the rate of 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.909
 prestige that we currently have and of 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.550
 226 so we should have in the 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.449
 cooperative statistics rate 226 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:02.009
 Well, what do we do now? 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:03.900
 well as we currently have 220 of 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.819
 low mount rate of statistics 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:12.029
 cooperative and we have 75 thousand 674 casualties 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:14.309
 of zombies because we need to know how many 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:19.740
 low we need to have a 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:22.559
 rate of 226 and thus be able to have a 185 of 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.020
 prestige rate or is it good here 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:27.659
 what we have to do is multiply 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.089
 the prestige rate that we have good 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.110
 if because of low death of the 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.060
 cooperative statistics that 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.249
 we need to prestige 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.159
 multiplied by the casualties we have 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:39.870
 currently and divide it between the rate of 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:44.879
 low deaths that we currently have or 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:48.029
 be 220 and we would get 77 1737 casualties 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:51.749
 Well now we take and subtract 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:55.169
 with those that we have and we 

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:57.629
 come out two thousand 63 casualties well that 's the 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.659
 low that we would have to do to 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:01.650
 be able to prestige the shotgun and good 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.050
 this 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.930
 have to see what we have to do 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.780
 those casualties without dying even once 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.330
 because if we ever die one or two 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.229
 sometimes it goes to the calculations to the porra 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:22.560
 so we have to have 22 thousand 63 a 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:24.360
 0 is not worth 2 thousand 63 to 1 nor for the achievement 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.580
 that I do not know how much is it was four thousand and 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.919
 peak two look for style has 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:33.960
 that be two thousand 63 to zero if you want 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:36.419
 calculate falling only once you have to 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.490
 do other calculations but good these 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.260
 are the casualties that we have to do without 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.710
 die only once to prestige the 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.680
 shotgun and with this we would have the 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:49.680
 skulls with shotguns blue eyes 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.180
 I already told you that that part does not have 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.080
 nothing to do with this the casualty rate 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:58.199
 deaths and I hope you liked the 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:01.289
 video that has been helpful to you if 

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:03.899
 you have any doubt what you are commenting below 

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:05.999
 and well I hope you like it 

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:08.189
 Please vote that we share it with 

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:10.409
 look like channel that we already have almost a thousand 

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:13.439
 visualizations so many 

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:17.599
 thank you all and nothing more until the 

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:17.599
 view and be happy kids until then
