it disabled it in a board again doesn't
always<00:03:54.140> like<00:03:54.290> you're<00:03:54.530> doing<00:03:54.740> that<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:54.980> does

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
always like you're doing that it does

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.930 
always like you're doing that it does
sometimes<00:03:55.780> break<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.900> program<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.260> little<00:03:57.440> bit

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
sometimes break the program a little bit

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.510 
sometimes break the program a little bit
so<00:03:58.940> i'll<00:03:59.000> try<00:03:59.240> again<00:03:59.510> background<00:03:59.930> labeled

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
so i'll try again background labeled

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.920 
so i'll try again background labeled
this<00:04:01.520> sami<00:04:01.730> didn't<00:04:02.000> crash<00:04:02.210> it<00:04:02.240> also<00:04:02.690> might

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
this sami didn't crash it also might

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.740 
this sami didn't crash it also might
were<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.380> time<00:04:06.700> yeah<00:04:07.700> that's<00:04:08.360> call<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.630> out

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
were this time yeah that's call it out

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.410 
were this time yeah that's call it out
on<00:04:08.960> some<00:04:09.680> say<00:04:09.860> sometimes<00:04:10.220> it's<00:04:10.520> not<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:11.060> hundred

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
on some say sometimes it's not a hundred

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.580 
on some say sometimes it's not a hundred
percent<00:04:12.040> because<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.310> made<00:04:13.460> by<00:04:13.520> some

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
percent because it is made by some

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.949
