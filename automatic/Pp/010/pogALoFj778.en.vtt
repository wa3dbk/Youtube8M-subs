00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
what's a video today we're gonna take a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.030 
what's a video today we're gonna take a
look<00:00:06.810> at<00:00:07.049> IO<00:00:07.380> s9o<00:00:07.920> night<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:08.519> two<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.769> can't

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
look at IO s9o night at two so you can't

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.700 
look at IO s9o night at two so you can't
see<00:00:14.309> here<00:00:14.760> it's<00:00:15.599> oil<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.109> mine

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.010 

and<00:00:21.280> while<00:00:21.610> we<00:00:21.820> are<00:00:21.850> here<00:00:22.180> in<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.420> settings<00:00:22.810> we

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
and while we are here in the settings we

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.050 
and while we are here in the settings we
can<00:00:23.080> see<00:00:23.440> here<00:00:23.680> something<00:00:23.980> you<00:00:24.430> know<00:00:24.520> that's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
can see here something you know that's

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.260 
can see here something you know that's
just<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.600> search<00:00:26.400> quickly<00:00:27.400> for<00:00:27.640> some<00:00:27.880> settings

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
just to search quickly for some settings

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.450 
just to search quickly for some settings
that<00:00:28.390> you<00:00:28.690> might<00:00:29.170> use<00:00:29.440> like<00:00:29.619> Wi-Fi<00:00:30.250> for

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
that you might use like Wi-Fi for

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.130 
that you might use like Wi-Fi for
example

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.320 

and<00:00:38.680> let's<00:00:39.040> see<00:00:39.190> how<00:00:39.310> quickly<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.730> opens<00:00:40.150> up

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
and let's see how quickly it opens up

00:00:40.330 --> 00:01:21.710 
and let's see how quickly it opens up
the<00:00:40.510> apps

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:57.270 

so<00:01:22.290> yeah<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.800> definitely<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.580> lag

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.390 

all<00:01:58.280> right

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.749 

as<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.210> open<00:02:08.509> up<00:02:08.660> sisters<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.950> use<00:02:10.130> lots<00:02:10.580> of

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
as you open up sisters to use lots of

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.360 
as you open up sisters to use lots of
memory<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:12.070> becomes<00:02:13.070> really<00:02:13.340> slow<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.860> if

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
memory and becomes really slow and if

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
memory and becomes really slow and if
you<00:02:16.490> are<00:02:16.610> thinking<00:02:17.030> which<00:02:17.630> one's<00:02:17.900> faster<00:02:18.170> I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
you are thinking which one's faster I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.390 
you are thinking which one's faster I
always<00:02:18.860> say<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.130> 9<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.920> definitely<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.070> always

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
always say to 9 so definitely I always

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.930 
always say to 9 so definitely I always
say<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.790> better

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.910 

of<00:02:32.420> course<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.810> doesn't<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.890> of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
of course it doesn't have a lot of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
of course it doesn't have a lot of
features<00:02:34.660> which<00:02:35.660> are<00:02:35.870> other<00:02:36.470> tablets<00:02:37.130> other

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
features which are other tablets other

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.600 
features which are other tablets other
iPads<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.340> slide<00:02:40.610> over<00:02:41.080> and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
iPads have like the slide over and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.760 
iPads have like the slide over and
picture<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> picture<00:02:43.880> after<00:02:44.570> all<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.350> iPad

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
picture a picture after all this is iPad

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.370 

and<00:02:55.790> there<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.210> go<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.450> can<00:02:56.780> see<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:57.200> it's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
and there you go you can see that it's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:08.860 
and there you go you can see that it's
really<00:02:57.650> slow

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.289 

does<00:03:09.500> take<00:03:09.830> about<00:03:10.360> 20<00:03:11.360> seconds<00:03:11.900> just<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.319> open

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
does take about 20 seconds just to open

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.390 
does take about 20 seconds just to open
one<00:03:14.299> application<00:03:17.379> as<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.409> can<00:03:18.769> see<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.159> been

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
one application as you can see it's been

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.990 
one application as you can see it's been
like<00:03:20.260> 20<00:03:21.260> 30<00:03:21.560> seconds<00:03:22.099> since<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.489> opened<00:03:22.879> this

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
like 20 30 seconds since I opened this

00:03:23.000 --> 00:04:02.250 
like 20 30 seconds since I opened this
app<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:24.069> still<00:03:25.069> just<00:03:25.700> now<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:28.400> loaded

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:17.650 

that's<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.099> very

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:51.119 

and<00:04:18.200> that's<00:04:18.470> apple.com

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:05:04.529 

no<00:04:51.789> that's<00:04:52.059> he<00:04:52.300> gaming

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:40.950 

you<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.110> see<00:05:05.379> it's<00:05:06.159> the<00:05:06.400> loading

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.600 

even<00:05:41.710> while<00:05:41.889> you're<00:05:42.160> playing<00:05:42.449> it<00:05:43.449> lacks<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:44.050> lot

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
even while you're playing it lacks a lot

00:05:44.610 --> 00:06:02.260 
even while you're playing it lacks a lot
it's<00:05:45.610> really<00:05:45.880> slow

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:10.280 

you<00:06:02.960> can<00:06:03.230> see<00:06:03.440> all<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.890> help<00:06:04.040> and<00:06:04.190> apps

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:19.970 

and<00:06:10.830> you<00:06:10.920> just<00:06:11.160> worry<00:06:11.430> about<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.730> closet

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.940 

well<00:06:20.580> if<00:06:20.880> you<00:06:21.000> open<00:06:21.300> up<00:06:21.540> only<00:06:21.960> one<00:06:22.290> application

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
well if you open up only one application

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:33.770 
well if you open up only one application
so<00:06:23.280> it's<00:06:23.520> okay

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.610 

my<00:06:34.350> Purdue<00:06:34.710> has<00:06:34.950> only<00:06:35.360> 512<00:06:36.360> megabytes<00:06:37.170> of<00:06:37.350> RAM

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
my Purdue has only 512 megabytes of RAM

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:44.060 
my Purdue has only 512 megabytes of RAM
so<00:06:41.810> in<00:06:42.810> my<00:06:43.020> opinion<00:06:43.470> they<00:06:43.620> should<00:06:43.650> have

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
so in my opinion they should have

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.070 
so in my opinion they should have
stopped<00:06:45.060> at<00:06:45.420> iOS<00:06:45.900> 6<00:06:46.460> but<00:06:47.460> there<00:06:47.670> you<00:06:47.760> go<00:06:48.000> if<00:06:48.900> you

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
stopped at iOS 6 but there you go if you

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.560 
stopped at iOS 6 but there you go if you
ask<00:06:49.260> me<00:06:50.060> iOS<00:06:51.060> 8<00:06:51.240> is<00:06:51.300> better<00:06:51.690> on<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:52.080> iPad<00:06:52.380> 2
