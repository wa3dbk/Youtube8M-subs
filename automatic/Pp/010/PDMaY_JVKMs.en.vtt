00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 yes hello could have had one together 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 Another let's play is on the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.299
 planpotter and i will take care of it now 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.000
 First of all for the last challenge 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.830
 I completely forgot that one more 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 the goblins who want to march are open 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.450
 Let's have a look and I think so 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.890
 I have to win in one there 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.730
 just recently read yes in this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.230
 to win 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.970
 I think what we do not like when 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.590
 slayer angel faxing 664 city life 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.219
 actually 500 angels but through the five 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.629
 plus one plus one 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:43.290
 kempe bell a few 22 vanilla cobra 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.899
 11 am clear war driver with two pieces 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.789
 So the battle cry gives everyone else +10 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.690
 cheek and arsonist 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.989
 Here will be the shooting of the melting furnace 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.989
 wheel 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.410
 so damaging the dragon twice 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.660
 swallows any knocks it is a 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.120
 Customer is not against the many angels and 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.770
 rudelfÃ¼hrer I think I play him 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.730
 also because the parts so hear now 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.080
 my sheep in the first round 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.900
 let's see what attract so much for what 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.450
 Throwing away a lava ax I pull 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.700
 I can actually get another card 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:29.030
 now in did play a cow 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 nothing can wrestle with the wrestling or anything 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.460
 the title does not break me either 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.290
 do now just now 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 not big first calculated by the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.090
 Melting furnace doubles my 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.910
 chance and then I just look 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.570
 the war finally 18 only live through 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.040
 block 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 I just watch how much damage 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.680
 that would eventually bring 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.500
 and I look at all like that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.070
 to play at all is the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.200
 challenge if that is now 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.850
 does not come at all then it is up 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.759
 in any case the wrong way though 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.890
 better that I am okay with you now 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.570
 Here you are minutes ahead of what he still expect 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.070
 16 next to the jet skis I again 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.260
 two 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.660
 that's the wrong one in any case 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.530
 the angels must be method from 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.920
 prevent them from flying or shoot them away 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.920
 cetera 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.219
 how do i start now is the here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.409
 question 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.450
 Shooting six programs is over 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:39.650
 the promotion to angel is pretty much 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:39.650
 out of focus at the moment was 54 damage 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.660
 Is that possible 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.490
 maybe I have to look how 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.790
 but chandra plogmann dance maybe 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.080
 how good i think i have the idea 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.210
 So there must always give to loose now 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.990
 say as I have been saying we are Adani 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:14.620
 yes the fabric hood 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:17.980
 I have an idea if nothing 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.960
 other good on my own play piece 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.550
 here the lonesome blogger what is it 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.750
 now arsonists do a harm 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.330
 means I shoot a blogger 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.250
 away plays the gatsch looks behind 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.690
 for two lives I go to two means 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:44.550
 it gets to the block of a chain 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:47.830
 no life around war 4 714 live perfectly 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.300
 subtracted wonderfully tricky tricky the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.030
 card is now indeed in fact as 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.920
 played last but I found 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.700
 again, for example, to challenge 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.840
 I find myself a cool 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.090
 I can challenge now 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.320
 actually not so confident that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.760
 you play the number on yourself 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.610
 I really just wanted to like 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.600
 shoot the angels 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.070
 sometimes you can find it very well 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.510
 we realize we want to follow 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.890
 but still what magic one 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.080
 could play 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.290
 I would believe it relatively obvious 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.700
 me what you play and yes my tip 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.840
 if you now see the video you have 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.160
 seen how it works but it's worth it 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.120
 always get out at such easy 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.630
 give it a try 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.800
 by simply playing two rounds 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.560
 then you get that in any case 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.510
 many cool challenges in the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.770
 next match play the revenge campaign 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.689
 it goes to the indians I would say 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.879
 I'll watch some daily games 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:36.029
 Let's see her on her nice day 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.029
 soon
