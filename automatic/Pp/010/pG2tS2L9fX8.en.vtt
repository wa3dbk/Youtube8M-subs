00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.639
 Zuiderhaven for the annual spectacle 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.639

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.170
 some have been around since childhood 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.880
 I have experienced this as a child in the past 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.710

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.080

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.610
 visible from the show 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.880
 Well 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.470

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.060
