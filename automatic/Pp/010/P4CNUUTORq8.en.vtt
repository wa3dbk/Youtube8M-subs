00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.200
 the crawl swimming is the fastest 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
 nice technique no wonder finally 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960
 provide arms and legs for drive without 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.250
 every interruption 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 but it is far from the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.480
 lightest floating expert Annika milan 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 is for the Haaner health promotion 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.960
 movement for north hesse in action and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.029
 trains among others with ours 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 editor guido peters twice a week 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.720
 really nice 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
 she has explained to us what is important 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189
 and which is the most common mistake 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.189
 are 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.950
 if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.750
 this position 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 under the 11th 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.309
 continue to exist 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.309
 by offered in the water 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.900
 from joa 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.900
 not me 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 I 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.030
 with the milking 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.030
 in the down 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.510
 the breathe 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.410
 about every third flight once left 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.410
 side and once 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.520
 and what about the bahntechnik from 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.390
 and what gets wrong most often 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.390
 made 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.660
 but he has to stand up 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.570
 the wrist 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.810
 if annika mehlhorn obeyed advice 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.250
 then there is no doubt that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.959
 Not only with clean technology 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.470
 but also faster to the goal 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.470
 coming
