finally slime is tenth wow that was

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.470 
finally slime is tenth wow that was
quite<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.810> lot<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.379> information<00:04:05.970> let's<00:04:06.970> recall

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
quite a lot of information let's recall

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.520 
quite a lot of information let's recall
the<00:04:07.690> points<00:04:08.170> one<00:04:08.440> by<00:04:08.650> one<00:04:10.019> ordinal<00:04:11.019> numbers

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
the points one by one ordinal numbers

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.449 
the points one by one ordinal numbers
give<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:12.010> position<00:04:12.639> of<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:13.239> given<00:04:13.629> object<00:04:14.459> you

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
give the position of a given object you

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.699 
give the position of a given object you
can<00:04:15.760> write<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.239> ordinal<00:04:16.840> form<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.410> numbers

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
can write the ordinal form of numbers

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.620 
can write the ordinal form of numbers
wrong<00:04:18.669> one<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.599> ten<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.139> their<00:04:20.470> short<00:04:20.829> forms

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
wrong one to ten in their short forms

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.080 
wrong one to ten in their short forms
you<00:04:22.630> can<00:04:22.900> also<00:04:23.229> identify<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:24.250> ordinal

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
you can also identify the ordinal

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.830 
you can also identify the ordinal
position<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.900> any<00:04:26.169> given<00:04:26.740> object<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.840> express

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
position of any given object and express

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.060 
position of any given object and express
it<00:04:29.080> in<00:04:29.289> number<00:04:30.220> names<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:31.630> ordinals<00:04:32.289> from<00:04:32.680> 1

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
it in number names the ordinals from 1

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.439 
it in number names the ordinals from 1
to<00:04:33.340> 10<00:04:33.669> are<00:04:33.940> as<00:04:34.570> follows<00:04:36.300> poorest<00:04:38.039> second

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449
