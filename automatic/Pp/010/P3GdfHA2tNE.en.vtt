00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.590 

so<00:01:37.560> looks<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:37.979> has<00:01:38.310> got<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.580> tubular<00:01:39.270> bit

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so looks like this has got a tubular bit

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.460 
so looks like this has got a tubular bit
sort<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:40.650> extension<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:45.619> please

the<00:01:58.770> reason<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.399> doing<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:01.159> because<00:02:02.159> if

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the reason I'm doing this is because if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
the reason I'm doing this is because if
you've<00:02:02.729> done<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.470> skewers<00:02:04.470> will<00:02:04.619> fall<00:02:04.830> out

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you've done the skewers will fall out

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.380 
you've done the skewers will fall out
the<00:02:05.190> end<00:02:06.470> sometimes<00:02:08.119> sometimes<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.239> get

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the end sometimes sometimes you get

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.880 
the end sometimes sometimes you get
lucky<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.350> stay<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.709> by

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
lucky and they just stay there by

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.310 
lucky and they just stay there by
themselves<00:02:11.070> okay<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.019> to<00:02:13.110> attach

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
themselves okay then you want to attach

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.080 
themselves okay then you want to attach
your<00:02:13.530> stores<00:02:13.860> together<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.400> put<00:02:17.970> your

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
your stores together so you put your

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:27.690 
your stores together so you put your
nail<00:02:18.300> into<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:19.100> fold<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.280> over

have to take this soap with them and

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.750 
have to take this soap with them and
also<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.700> can<00:03:43.030> see<00:03:43.769> I've<00:03:44.769> taped<00:03:45.069> this<00:03:45.310> end<00:03:45.579> as

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
also you can see I've taped this end as

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.379 
also you can see I've taped this end as
well<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:49.239> stop<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.750> skewers<00:03:50.170> go<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
well just to stop the skewers go so the

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.449 
well just to stop the skewers go so the
reason<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.900> put<00:03:53.049> skewed<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.739> is<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.250> it's

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
reason you put skewed in is so it's

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:06.870 
reason you put skewed in is so it's
strong<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:59.380> how<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.709> make<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.750> best<00:04:02.549> cat<00:04:03.549> toy
