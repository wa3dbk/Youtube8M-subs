00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.390
 welcome to Italian home cooking today we prepare 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.839
 a recipe for summer without fire 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.619
 cheese stuffed peppers 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:21.619
 this time as cheese I chose rows of goat's goat but you can also use young pecorino 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.140
 or another cheese you like 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 let's start by preparing the cheese filling which in this case will be 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.319
 really very very simple 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.160
 because it is a very rich cheese 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 we kept it out of the fridge so it was 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.220
 reasonably soft 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.510
 it is not necessary, since you will put it in hot peppers, add pepper 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.420
 and the oil is already soft for the moment 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.880
 then we put it to work with a fork 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.280
 to have then 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.380
 easy to insert into chillies 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.370
 let's put our cheese aside and start the fun part of the game 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.470
 which is the cleaning of hot peppers, for this job I suggest you to use a pair of gloves 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.370
 latex also because many people 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 I'm 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.210
 very sensitive 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.760
 with chilli pepper 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.190
 so it may irritate you so annoying 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.580
 it will have to be emptied 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 accurately our chili from the seeds 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.050
 after cutting the cap 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.720
 we remove the seeds 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.330
 slowly with the small knife 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.210
 then 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.960
 arrange the chilli 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.900
 in cold water, we wash it well 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.840
 and we put it to dry 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.300
 if you prefer 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.880
 of chillies 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.930
 less spicy you can also pass them in boiling water 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.060
 for 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.060
 no more than a minute otherwise they will become soft 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.429
 now we prepare the jars 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:43.929
 in which we are going to preserve our chilli 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.559
 to perfume it a little 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:51.569
 cut a clove of garlic into slices 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.749
 and we put it in the jar 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.660
 so let's start a 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.129
 to fill 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.649
 fill them by pressing well 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.419
 so that the cheese remains inside 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.489
 the chili pepper 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.739
 so we're going to fix it 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.319
 in the jar 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.299
 trying to leave as little space as possible 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.229
 first layer format 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.699
 if you want that 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.139
 your chillies are more fragrant you can add a few leaves of fresh oregano 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.159
 or dry 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.679
 now that our jar 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:36.679
 it is full and we are sure that another chilli just does not enter 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.569
 all we have to do is complete with the odor leaflets 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.159
 and fill well 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.509
 with oil 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.869
 so as to cover the peppers perfectly 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:56.219
 it is important because if they are not well covered by oil they risk molding 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.709
 so this operation must be done very carefully 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.929
 I advise you to use jars not too big so that once opened 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.129
 they can be completely exhausted 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.619
 Time after time 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.239
 at this point I just have to close the jar 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.909
 and keep it in a cool place for at least a week before tasting it 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:25.610
 this will make the peppers a little less spicy and the flavor more amalgamated 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.069
 see you soon for a new recipe about Italian home cooking
