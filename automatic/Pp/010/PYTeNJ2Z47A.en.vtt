00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 well I'm not going to put my beast 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 because you know what bachetta but good 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.550
 I put my name of the night this 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.750
 night I'll put my dating cloud if not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 there is no one if it were a more vivid color 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.480
 make it look good long 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.160
 be seen 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 Well, let's start 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.370
 you are prepared, it is not worth that, it has already accelerated 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.010
 and it goes straight the crazy I go rest 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.820
 because I like it but I had to go down 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.400
 travel 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 and God has lied to you was as a child 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.660
 cheated on a come 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.140
 what do you say tremendous 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:28.149
 and good 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.940
 thanks to these tricks the turbo 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:50.170
 it's like the fucking roadrunner and you look and 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 it gives me goop like a curve 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.780
 to the race run I'm catching you 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.899
 You open the run that I'm catching you 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.899
 it happened but what I 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.810
 a little help 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:14.240
 always clear to the night of the pull everything 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.000
 is perfect uncle and me too 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.580
 and I came hopefully now it's just that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 it falls well it has gone perfect let's go 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.260
 look at the game but I have fallen a lot 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.860
 all right 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.099
 I love long runs this round are 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.689
 two won with the shit turbo I know 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.689
 what are you wearing today 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.580
 but we're already with the guards but 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.490
 why should we keep it clean 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.260
 because you have to make a garrison because 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.060
 you have to do clean I'll call you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.750
 from now on but the clean from 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.370
 then yes, when you want 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.370
 I am 2 clean good 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.360
 worry be happy 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.240
 somersault so I have a 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.010
 professionalism let's go 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.760
 but do not worry that the phenomenon of 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:18.450
 do not I'll give you five seconds 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.450
 but it does not matter if it's 5 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.260
 do not
