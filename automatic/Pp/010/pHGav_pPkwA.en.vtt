gainers for height you can even take

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.290 
gainers for height you can even take
that<00:03:31.310> technique<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:31.700> apply<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.150> moves

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
that technique and apply it to moves

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.500
