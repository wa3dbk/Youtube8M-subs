that's<00:01:00.089> kind<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.390> unique<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.720> this<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that's kind of unique about this is that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.829 
that's kind of unique about this is that
he<00:01:01.260> can't<00:01:01.589> stand<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.100> he's<00:01:02.479> always<00:01:03.479> got<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
he can't stand up he's always got to

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.240 
he can't stand up he's always got to
fall<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.440> that's<00:01:04.559> why<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:04.979> sort

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
fall over so that's why I have this sort

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
fall over so that's why I have this sort

the<00:01:46.680> same<00:01:46.950> figure<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.000> they<00:01:48.180> gave<00:01:48.360> us<00:01:48.390> new

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the same figure but they gave us new

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480 
the same figure but they gave us new
head<00:01:48.780> sculpt<00:01:49.080> new<00:01:49.380> arms<00:01:49.740> new<00:01:49.950> shoulder<00:01:50.280> pads

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
new paint job not too different but it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.540 
new paint job not too different but it
doesn't<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:52.890> bother<00:01:53.040> me<00:01:53.190> because<00:01:53.370> I

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
doesn't really bother me because I

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.190 
doesn't really bother me because I
really<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> roll<00:01:54.420> cage<00:01:54.570> Iron<00:01:54.870> Man<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
really like the roll cage Iron Man and I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.540 
really like the roll cage Iron Man and I
like<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.530> figure<00:01:55.710> -<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
like this figure - I really like the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.250 
like this figure - I really like the
possibility<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.120> it<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.720> it's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.050> pretty

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
possibility of it I think it's a pretty

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.950 
possibility of it I think it's a pretty
cool<00:01:58.350> looking<00:01:58.770> figure<00:01:59.280> man<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.880> dig<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
cool looking figure man I dig it now it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
cool looking figure man I dig it now it
seemed<00:02:01.380> pretty<00:02:01.590> flat<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.220> back<00:02:02.370> over<00:02:02.580> here

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
seemed pretty flat on the back over here

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.340 
seemed pretty flat on the back over here
it's<00:02:02.940> mostly<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.240> red<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:03.780> anyway<00:02:04.020> he

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
it's mostly just red but anyway he

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.570 
it's mostly just red but anyway he
doesn't<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.650> come<00:02:04.800> with<00:02:04.950> any<00:02:05.070> accessories

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
doesn't really come with any accessories

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.039 
doesn't really come with any accessories
aside<00:02:05.940> from<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> group<00:02:06.600> build<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.900> figure

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
aside from the group build a figure

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.080 
aside from the group build a figure
piece<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.560> he<00:02:07.770> comes<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.159> the<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.489> leg<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
piece so he comes with the right leg of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.490 
piece so he comes with the right leg of
Groot<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:09.539> I'll<00:02:09.690> show<00:02:09.840> off<00:02:09.929> once<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.229> review

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
Groot which I'll show off once I review

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
Groot which I'll show off once I review
the<00:02:10.590> Groot<00:02:10.860> figure<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.580> yeah<00:02:12.060> let's<00:02:12.209> take<00:02:12.299> a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the Groot figure so yeah let's take a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.880 
the Groot figure so yeah let's take a
closer<00:02:12.599> look<00:02:12.810> at<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.049> figure<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> really

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
closer look at this figure so I really

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.110 
closer look at this figure so I really
like<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.129> head<00:02:14.250> sculpt<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.819> figure<00:02:15.090> I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
like the head sculpt on this figure I

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.580 
like the head sculpt on this figure I
think<00:02:15.330> they<00:02:15.390> did<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> good<00:02:15.750> job<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.440> all

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
these little sculpted lines over here

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.030 
these little sculpted lines over here
towards<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> top<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.780> his<00:02:18.900> head<00:02:19.080> looks<00:02:19.739> pretty

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
towards the top of his head looks pretty

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.039 
towards the top of his head looks pretty
good<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.819> paint<00:02:21.000> applications<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:21.629> okay

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
good and the paint applications are okay

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.809 
good and the paint applications are okay
for<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.379> most<00:02:22.620> part<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.310> little<00:02:23.580> shoddy

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
for the most part it's a little shoddy

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.360 
for the most part it's a little shoddy
right<00:02:24.120> there<00:02:24.299> towards<00:02:24.629> his<00:02:24.780> ear<00:02:25.080> section<00:02:25.650> but

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
right there towards his ear section but

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.339 
right there towards his ear section but

over the mouth guard and on the top of

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.720 
over the mouth guard and on the top of
his<00:02:28.470> head<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> gold<00:02:28.890> looks<00:02:29.099> really<00:02:29.370> cool<00:02:29.549> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
his head the gold looks really cool and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
his head the gold looks really cool and
I<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:29.819> like<00:02:30.120> how<00:02:30.239> they<00:02:30.360> did<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> eye

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I really like how they did the eye

I really like how they did the eye
sockets<00:02:31.319> it's<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.950> theme<00:02:32.159> throughout<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
sockets it's a theme throughout the

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.699 
sockets it's a theme throughout the
figure<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.209> have<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:33.659> little<00:02:33.989> yellow

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
figure that we have these little yellow

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.540 
figure that we have these little yellow
areas<00:02:35.459> with<00:02:35.760> an<00:02:35.939> orange

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
areas with an orange

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.340 
areas with an orange
trim<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.180> think<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.540> looks<00:02:37.810> great

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
trim and I think that looks great

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.020 
trim and I think that looks great
especially<00:02:38.440> on<00:02:38.830> his<00:02:38.980> repulsors<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.700> his<00:02:39.820> arc

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
especially on his repulsors and his arc

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.430 
especially on his repulsors and his arc
reactor<00:02:40.090> which<00:02:40.570> I'll<00:02:40.720> show<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> little<00:02:41.320> bit

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
reactor which I'll show in a little bit

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.320 
reactor which I'll show in a little bit
but<00:02:41.710> again<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.130> can<00:02:42.280> see<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.700> left<00:02:43.030> ear<00:02:43.300> over

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
but again you can see the left ear over

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.480 
but again you can see the left ear over

pretty cool and then as I'd mentioned
earlier<00:03:02.290> with<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.680> arc<00:03:03.100> reactor<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.820> having

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
earlier with the arc reactor and having

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.510 
earlier with the arc reactor and having
that<00:03:04.840> orange<00:03:05.200> outline<00:03:05.440> being<00:03:06.070> get<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.340> kind

of<00:03:06.550> detail<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.060> Heroic<00:03:07.360> Age<00:03:07.450> Iron<00:03:07.720> Man<00:03:07.870> so

of detail on the Heroic Age Iron Man so

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.570 
of detail on the Heroic Age Iron Man so
I<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.770> there<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.430> this

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
I like that we have that there but this

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.310 
I like that we have that there but this
torso<00:03:09.850> section<00:03:10.150> looks<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.540> little<00:03:10.660> lacking<00:03:11.170> to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
torso section looks a little lacking to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.480 
torso section looks a little lacking to
me<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:11.590> they<00:03:11.800> could<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.040> added<00:03:12.190> more

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
me I think they could have added more

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.700 
me I think they could have added more

from the book you know it looks like he

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.660 
from the book you know it looks like he
had<00:03:17.110> more<00:03:17.380> paint<00:03:17.680> applications<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> torso

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
had more paint applications in the torso

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.030 
had more paint applications in the torso
section<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.900> thigh<00:03:20.200> areas<00:03:20.710> too

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
again you can kind of see this

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.360 
again you can kind of see this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
little bit that crackling in the plastic

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.040 
little bit that crackling in the plastic
right<00:03:33.760> there<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.120> shin<00:03:34.510> which<00:03:34.750> kind<00:03:35.020> of

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
right there on a shin which kind of

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.810 
right there on a shin which kind of
makes<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.320> figure<00:03:35.560> look<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:35.920> little<00:03:36.160> cheap<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
makes the figure look a little cheap I

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.030 
makes the figure look a little cheap I
think<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.840> here's<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.200> arm<00:03:38.410> nice<00:03:38.770> cold

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
think and here's the arm nice cold

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.280 
think and here's the arm nice cold
applications<00:03:39.670> right<00:03:39.850> there<00:03:40.030> on<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.240> arm<00:03:40.450> not

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
applications right there on the arm not

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.560 
applications right there on the arm not
much<00:03:41.590> paint<00:03:41.950> going<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.370> back<00:03:42.580> here<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:43.030> little

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
much paint going on back here a little

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.480 
much paint going on back here a little
disappointing<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.410> regard<00:03:44.800> but<00:03:45.040> not<00:03:45.459> a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
disappointing in that regard but not a

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.340 
disappointing in that regard but not a
big<00:03:45.670> deal<00:03:45.880> again<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.420> like<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.720> articulation

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
big deal again I like the articulation

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.590 
big deal again I like the articulation
on<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:47.560> figure<00:03:47.860> he<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.070> fun<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.520> pose<00:03:48.940> he<00:03:49.480> has

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
on this figure he is fun to pose he has

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.260 
on this figure he is fun to pose he has
a<00:03:49.630> head<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.140> moves<00:03:50.410> up<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:51.130> much<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.940> you

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
a head that moves up that much and you

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.610 
a head that moves up that much and you
can<00:03:52.450> move<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.660> head<00:03:52.780> down<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.470> rotates

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
can move the head down and it rotates

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.570 
can move the head down and it rotates
side-to-side

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
side-to-side

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.910 
side-to-side
and<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.330> guess<00:03:55.540> tiny<00:03:55.990> bit<00:03:56.230> neck<00:03:56.440> pivot<00:03:56.740> not

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
and I guess tiny bit neck pivot not

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.250 
and I guess tiny bit neck pivot not
really<00:03:57.370> he<00:03:57.820> has<00:03:57.910> these<00:03:58.090> hinged<00:03:58.660> shoulder<00:03:59.020> pads

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
really he has these hinged shoulder pads

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.870 
really he has these hinged shoulder pads
over<00:03:59.560> here<00:03:59.800> that<00:04:00.010> are<00:04:00.130> attached<00:04:00.430> with<00:04:00.640> these

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
over here that are attached with these

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.000 
over here that are attached with these
pegs<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.450> stick<00:04:01.840> out<00:04:02.020> right<00:04:02.350> there<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.890> then

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
pegs that stick out right there and then

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.100 
pegs that stick out right there and then
he<00:04:03.130> has<00:04:03.250> these<00:04:03.459> holes<00:04:03.730> on<00:04:04.030> both<00:04:04.090> sides<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
he has these holes on both sides of the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.900 
he has these holes on both sides of the
shoulder<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.040> can<00:04:06.190> just<00:04:06.340> plug<00:04:06.700> that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
shoulder and you can just plug that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.610 
shoulder and you can just plug that
right<00:04:07.090> in<00:04:07.209> these<00:04:07.360> tend<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.660> pop<00:04:07.990> off<00:04:08.200> as<00:04:08.440> you

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
right in these tend to pop off as you

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.130 
right in these tend to pop off as you
move<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:09.040> shoulder<00:04:09.370> joint<00:04:09.640> upwards<00:04:10.150> but<00:04:10.810> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
move the shoulder joint upwards but it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.660 
move the shoulder joint upwards but it
goes<00:04:11.500> right<00:04:11.709> back<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:11.980> there<00:04:12.310> pretty<00:04:12.580> easily

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
goes right back on there pretty easily

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.699 
goes right back on there pretty easily
so<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.240> can<00:04:13.360> move<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.660> back<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.260> forth<00:04:14.350> over

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
so you can move this back and forth over

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.770 
so you can move this back and forth over
here<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.430> shoulders<00:04:15.820> will<00:04:16.000> move<00:04:16.239> up<00:04:16.390> that

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
here the shoulders will move up that

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.420 
here the shoulders will move up that
much<00:04:17.109> once<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.500> move<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.770> up<00:04:17.859> past<00:04:18.100> that

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
much once you move it up past that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.949 
much once you move it up past that
though<00:04:18.640> it's<00:04:18.820> going<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> pop<00:04:19.299> right<00:04:19.480> off<00:04:19.540> as

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
though it's going to pop right off as

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.810 
though it's going to pop right off as
you<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.260> see<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.680> then<00:04:21.100> he<00:04:21.190> has<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> bicep

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
you can see and then he has a bicep

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.760 
you can see and then he has a bicep
swivel<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.510> can<00:04:22.690> rotate<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.080> shoulders

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
swivel and you can rotate the shoulders

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.409 
swivel and you can rotate the shoulders
forward<00:04:24.160> by<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.370> way<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:25.000> shoulder<00:04:25.270> pad

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
forward by the way and the shoulder pad

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.909 
forward by the way and the shoulder pad
doesn't<00:04:25.750> hinder<00:04:25.960> any<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.440> articulation

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
doesn't hinder any of that articulation

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.830 
doesn't hinder any of that articulation
at<00:04:27.100> all<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.370> bicep<00:04:27.730> swivel<00:04:28.030> double<00:04:28.600> jointed

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
at all so bicep swivel double jointed

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.200

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.440 
the figure I think it's very well done I
could<00:05:33.640> have<00:05:33.730> used<00:05:33.910> some<00:05:34.090> more<00:05:34.240> paint

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450

could have used some more paint
applications<00:05:35.050> but<00:05:35.290> other<00:05:35.500> than<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:36.190> think

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
applications but other than that I think

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.580 
applications but other than that I think
it's<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:36.670> badass<00:05:37.060> Iron<00:05:37.330> Man<00:05:37.570> figure<00:05:38.020> hope<00:05:38.470> you
