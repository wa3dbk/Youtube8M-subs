there's going to be some reflection on
the<00:03:33.550> screen<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:34.000> tried<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.330> cancel<00:03:34.540> out<00:03:34.810> as<00:03:34.930> much

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
the screen I tried to cancel out as much

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.510 
the screen I tried to cancel out as much
light<00:03:35.290> as<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.500> possibly<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.340> was

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
light as I possibly can but I was

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.250 
light as I possibly can but I was
recording<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> middle<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.140> day

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
recording this in the middle of the day

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.600 
recording this in the middle of the day
so<00:03:38.320> there<00:03:38.620> was<00:03:38.770> some<00:03:38.950> light<00:03:39.130> coming<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.580> from

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
so there was some light coming in from

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.050 
so there was some light coming in from
the<00:03:39.880> window<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:41.200> looking<00:03:42.160> at<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.400> screen<00:03:42.700> if

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the window but looking at the screen if

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
the window but looking at the screen if
you're<00:03:43.240> holding<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.630> your<00:03:43.660> hand<00:03:43.960> the

you're holding in your hand the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.650 
you're holding in your hand the
resolution<00:03:44.710> is<00:03:44.860> absolutely<00:03:45.700> incredible

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
resolution is absolutely incredible

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.260 
resolution is absolutely incredible
hopefully<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.530> got<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.680> sense<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.310> from

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
hopefully you got a sense of it from

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.880 
hopefully you got a sense of it from
that<00:03:49.420> video<00:03:49.660> but<00:03:50.020> again<00:03:50.320> some<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.710> that's

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
that video but again some of that's

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.260

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
going to be washed out a little bit

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.900 
going to be washed out a little bit
because<00:03:52.990> of<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.980> color<00:03:54.190> that's<00:03:54.430> coming<00:03:54.760> in

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
because of the color that's coming in
