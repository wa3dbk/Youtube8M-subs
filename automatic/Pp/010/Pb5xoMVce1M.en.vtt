 victims of amia tell us a little 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 because you have to have this vision

 belt were made in the framework of a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200
 wide interview that was being 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.840
 making on the occasion of his visit to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.180

 about your country's relationship with 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.960

 theocratic Iranian saying that at least

 making formal democracy 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.650
 and when the journalist noted 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.750
 interviewer who was reporting 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.270
 at that time he told him that the question 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.460
 of the links with Iran that were a 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.270
 very sensitive issue for the republic 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.480
 Argentina because of the very accusations 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.500
 serious and supported that you have formulated 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.610
 a prosecutor's office in Buenos Aires or against 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.770
 8 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 Iranian officials in relation to a 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.620
 terrorist attack against the headquarters of the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.980
 Amia in Buenos Aires in the year 1994 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.190
 the president strap answered 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.920
 good that he knew it was a very 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.790
 painful for Argentina but that of 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.190
 all modes how many people have died 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.140
 because of a NATO bombing 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.080
 in libya 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.080
 let's say and tried to elude the weather 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.790
 let's see a comparison absolutely 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.590
 out of place 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.980
 and putting putting if you choose in the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:10.050
 existence of seemingly good tyrant 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.680
 with the license he made of the deceased 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.120
 the dictator muamar kadhafi and also that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.210
 what has been especially 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.850
 surprising and painful was that these 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.330
 President Lee's comments were 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:31.410
 made in the same city where the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.770
 terrorist attack linked to the big tube 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.770
 rural 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.210
 let's say it was almost a snub to the country 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.860
 host and also Mr. widder finishing 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.780
 to receive a prize also in 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.770
 Argentina as the president 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.530
 Latin American for communication 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.120
 popular exalting its work for the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.670
 freedom of expression and democracy 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.130
 now you have sent a 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.250
 communication to the Ecuadorian embassy 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.300
 in Argentina you ask for an apology 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.970
 on the part of the Ecuadorian president 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.190
 how could he at this moment 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.590
 express themselves in favor of this annoyance of 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.200
 the Jewish community in Argentina does not 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.940
 we went that letter sent us from the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.430
 vicente perez center and from other 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.220
 community organizations in the country 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.500
 as you well point out we do 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.170
 we made a public appeal so that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.020
 he apologizes and we also understand that 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.750
 is a responsibility and should be a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.790
 interest of the authorities of the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.790
 Argentine republic than the president 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.180
 belt made some retraction or 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.110
 public apology because 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.910
 his words have been absolutely 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.330
 offensives not only for families of 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.740
 the victim but for all the all 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.840

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.949
 we were attacked by that attack 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.930
 terrorist and also let me add 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.880
 remember that among the 85 victims of 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.940
 terrorist attack against the amia there was 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.340
 six working Bolivian citizens 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.539
 Bolivians who were working on that 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:11.259
 moment in tasks of good of spare 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.120
 of the building so the offense was not 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.240
 only towards Argentina but 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.710
