00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.630
 Bjorn seemed like a very good one for you 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.210
 afternoon to be some handsome rescues 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.290
 done and then you think of a silly thing 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.060
 way maybe 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.890
 who even have the cash 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.279
 do you feel after this to this draw 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.320
 by bill there is then especially if you have ups on 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.440
 central one comes to play what they like 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.270
 also a strong asset was that that 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.220
 artificial grass is more true for them 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.250
 says hi in advance 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.430
 satisfied home but can feel it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.349
 especially 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.390
 I was very nice and had an ear and 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.860
 background pretty well put together 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.090
 I said how long I thought the longer the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.800
 time is progressing 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.780
 you can now feel your alex kind than that 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.090
 those who could go those three points 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.920
 bit stalk at 0 2 about but good 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.750
 must also honestly admit our chose 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.250
 also a bit happy so you want that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.079
 also finished and cedra has the second half 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.340
 decreased so i feel that they are 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.170
 every 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.910
 design strong first half central 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.760
 strong second half am at fair 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.800
 draw and everyone back to is gone 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.530
 we end the first period with 21 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.089
 points out of 30 points so from 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.280
 week starts the second period with a 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.290
 against brussels then against westerlo how 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.010
 your feeling there must not be forgotten 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.950
 that we have thinking in 2030 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.869
 80% new players you have four or five 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.460
 topper team and all you had to do was still 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.470
 with all respect for other teams 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.450
 you will just have to get out of westerlo and then 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.890
 you have the first 12s to have all 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.780
 you have title candidates on paper 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.720
 all of you are already going with a whole 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.159
 new selection very new team 2130 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.540
 it can only grow but you have to 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.470
 no longer hide us and 2 the second 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.750
 period full to the bucket 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.090
 and if we can continue a series 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.650
 drop like now but a little more 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.479
 more efficient 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.890
 we need two the payroll there you can 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.270
 Saying who is going to win assembly never 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 predictable but I just again 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.500
 the top three end in that top two top 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.000
 and then you stay anyway 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.009
 turn at the top and then our 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.810
 ambitions are so let's go on 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.970
 goals but people are doing well 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 good 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.720
 good football and see Antwerp 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.490
 competing others otherwise the 2nd half can 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.510
 a central axis is under pressure 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.250
 don't yield 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.320
 so I have a good feeling about being late 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.550
 us but do the season the the prices 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.440
 be full of the meet 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.470
 distributed between 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.210
 we will see if there is fighting spirit 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.030
 we also saw you after the game 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.530
 just give up so did you get up 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.780
 other players where did he punch 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.310
 afgevers groot I just heard that 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.350
 everyone came to the conclusion that it was 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.240
 a goal it might once be mine 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.340
 career is going to get t and i think 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.750
 especially about that, but also about it 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.300
 that are mutually in that the second 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.590
 half that knows that we are no longer ballistic 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.060
 were the lines getting too big that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.100
 they came under pressure I had things 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.600
 more about that but of course I was 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.400
 wanted to be back in the go as quickly as possible 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.440
 because for lie realize that that ghoul 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.420
 that people have been laughed at 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 I also did not happen so there 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.680
 usually went more to the final question 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.970
 go and you are someone who the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.630
 supporters culture and then you can 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.790
 appreciate 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.620
 have you seen the video of van 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.370
 our fans who have a new song 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.410
 made 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.910
 yes i think there is a lot on achievement 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 from the dressing room 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.150
 think i have a couple of couple people 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.530
 by municipalities I have shown 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.209
 other boys also came up more 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 dressing room and I think a lot 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.300
 talks what happen out it 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.800
 talked about the players group for this 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.730
 may he bring it to them 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.610
 to have 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.720
 so you notice again today so you 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.360
 looks to the guest of it lives 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.060
 they are coming back and they are all Antwerp 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.430
 so here after 10 years they have it 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.230
 feeling that what they say this is this 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.590
 our here so what if buy for that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.720
 people 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.519
 we still get him through such videos 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.769
 more inspiration and even more motivation 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.209
 for thorn forest to walk through wall for 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.790
 we are working on those people 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.830
 so respect for people 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.880
 Antwerp has it we may conclude 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.880
 brings lasting judgment
