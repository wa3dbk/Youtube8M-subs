00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.250 
my mom always said boy you're great in
science<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.090> math<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.840> might<00:00:10.019> as<00:00:10.139> well

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
science and math so that might as well

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.900 
science and math so that might as well
be<00:00:10.440> something<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.980> go<00:00:11.099> into<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.639> think

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
be something that you go into I think

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.490 
be something that you go into I think
even<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> first-year<00:00:12.660> student<00:00:13.049> coming<00:00:13.230> here

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
even as a first-year student coming here

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.930 
even as a first-year student coming here
you<00:00:13.620> don't<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.920> pick<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> concentration

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
you don't have to pick a concentration

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
you don't have to pick a concentration
that<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.269> would<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.599> go<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.929> whether<00:00:16.230> it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that you would like to go in whether it

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.599 
that you would like to go in whether it
be<00:00:16.500> private<00:00:16.710> secretary<00:00:17.160> government

broadcast<00:00:18.320> research<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.800> take<00:00:20.369> an<00:00:20.460> intro

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
broadcast research you can take an intro

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
broadcast research you can take an intro
to<00:00:20.699> broadcast<00:00:21.119> class<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.660> did<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.050> do

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to broadcast class like I did you can do

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.109 
to broadcast class like I did you can do
some<00:00:22.769> undergraduate<00:00:23.130> research<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
some undergraduate research if you get a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.509 
some undergraduate research if you get a
broad<00:00:24.359> range<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.859> education<00:00:26.369> here

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
broad range of your education here

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.250 
broad range of your education here
rather<00:00:27.090> than<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:27.990> specific

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
rather than going into one specific

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.529 
rather than going into one specific
concentration<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.369> meteorology<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:30.390> was

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
concentration for meteorology it was

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.880 
concentration for meteorology it was
tough<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.500> definitely<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
tough you know like it was definitely a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
tough you know like it was definitely a
culture<00:00:32.250> shock<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:33.000> high<00:00:33.120> school<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
culture shock going from high school to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
culture shock going from high school to
college<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:35.430> overload<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
college it's really just an overload I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.580 
college it's really just an overload I
think<00:00:36.329> at<00:00:36.450> first<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.960> once<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> start<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
think at first but once you start to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.110 
think at first but once you start to
figure<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.920> balance<00:00:38.309> between<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.030> know

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
figure that balance between you know

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.340 
figure that balance between you know
like<00:00:39.300> here's<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.540> classwork<00:00:39.809> here's<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
like here's my classwork here's what I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290 
like here's my classwork here's what I
have<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.680> here's<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.340> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> schedule

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
have to do here's my kind of schedule

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
have to do here's my kind of schedule
for<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> week<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.440> good<00:00:43.710> idea

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
for the week you kind of get a good idea

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860 
for the week you kind of get a good idea
of<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> address<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.690> then

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
of how to address that and then

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
of how to address that and then
eventually<00:00:46.500> getting<00:00:46.770> involved<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> lot

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
eventually getting involved with a lot

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.069 
eventually getting involved with a lot
of<00:00:47.550> things<00:00:47.789> helped<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> create<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of things helped to kind of create a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
of things helped to kind of create a
more<00:00:49.410> refined<00:00:50.309> schedule<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.000> me<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
more refined schedule for me so that I

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.090 
more refined schedule for me so that I
wasn't<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.870> had<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.500> free<00:00:52.680> time<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
wasn't just had so much free time that I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.439 
wasn't just had so much free time that I
didn't<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.120> became

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
didn't know what to do with it I became

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.209 
didn't know what to do with it I became
an<00:00:54.600> admissions<00:00:54.960> representative<00:00:55.219> halfway

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
an admissions representative halfway

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.369 
an admissions representative halfway
through<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.719> second<00:00:58.020> year<00:00:58.140> here

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
through my first or my second year here

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
through my first or my second year here
there's<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.859> much<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.219> campus<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.910> I'm

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
there's so much to do on campus and I'm

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
there's so much to do on campus and I'm
not<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.329> involved<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.930> most<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> or

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
not really involved with most of it or

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
not really involved with most of it or
just<00:01:01.500> spend<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.859> time<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> hanging<00:01:02.609> out

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
just spend my time kind of hanging out

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.820 
just spend my time kind of hanging out
and<00:01:02.760> studying<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.619> involved

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and studying really so I got involved

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.370 
and studying really so I got involved
with<00:01:04.979> Spring<00:01:05.309> Fling<00:01:05.519> committee<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
with Spring Fling committee and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.330 
with Spring Fling committee and
alternative<00:01:07.380> Spring<00:01:07.560> Break<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.040> those<00:01:08.189> have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
alternative Spring Break so those have

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.410 
alternative Spring Break so those have
been<00:01:08.490> two<00:01:08.670> things<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.060> been<00:01:09.180> really

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
been two things that been really

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
been two things that been really
prominent<00:01:09.720> recently<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.409> life<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.130> I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
prominent recently in my life so I'm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
prominent recently in my life so I'm
constantly<00:01:11.520> doing<00:01:11.729> something<00:01:12.000> constantly

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
constantly doing something constantly

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
constantly doing something constantly
running<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.170> place<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> another<00:01:13.530> that's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
running from one place to another that's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
running from one place to another that's
definitely<00:01:14.400> helped<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> fill<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.939> time<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
definitely helped to fill my time but I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
definitely helped to fill my time but I
like<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> gives<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.920> be

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
like that because it gives me time to be

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.830

get my feet in the water there but that
internship<00:01:51.360> opportunity<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.960> hopefully

this summer I'll have a different

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
this summer I'll have a different
opportunity<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.119> work<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
opportunity to go and work on that so it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
opportunity to go and work on that so it
was<00:01:55.619> definitely<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.159> nice<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.579> break<00:01:56.700> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
was definitely a nice little break in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.459 
was definitely a nice little break in
the<00:01:56.850> heat<00:01:57.030> our<00:01:57.210> high<00:01:57.390> today<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.930> 78<00:01:58.380> in

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the heat our high today was 78 in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.360 
the heat our high today was 78 in
Providence<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.070> much<00:01:59.610> cooler<00:01:59.850> than<00:01:59.939> we've<00:02:00.240> had
