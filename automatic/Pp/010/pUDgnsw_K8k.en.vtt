hey<00:00:11.160> guys<00:00:11.340> ready<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:11.969> welcome<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> video

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
hey guys ready here welcome to a video

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.230 
hey guys ready here welcome to a video
that's<00:00:13.349> gonna<00:00:13.500> show<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.210> new

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
that's gonna show you all about the new

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.790 
that's gonna show you all about the new
tripwire<00:00:15.750> system<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.680> actually

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
tripwire system and how you can actually

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.099 
tripwire system and how you can actually
make<00:00:17.100> some<00:00:17.130> piston<00:00:17.850> doors<00:00:18.090> through<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.930> so

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
make some piston doors through it and so

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.570 
make some piston doors through it and so
she<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.380> quite<00:00:19.619> cool<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.859> its<00:00:20.070> using<00:00:20.310> sort<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
she is quite cool in its using sort of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
she is quite cool in its using sort of
the<00:00:20.640> same<00:00:20.850> technique<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.800> pressure<00:00:22.800> pads

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the same technique that pressure pads

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.000 
the same technique that pressure pads
use<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> water<00:00:24.210> through<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.010> throat

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
use just the water through the throat

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
use just the water through the throat
and<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.460> opens<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> wooden<00:00:27.150> doors<00:00:27.840> obviously

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and it opens this wooden doors obviously

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.070 
and it opens this wooden doors obviously
this<00:00:28.380> isn't<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:28.820> set<00:00:29.820> into<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.630> wall<00:00:30.929> or

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
this isn't actually set into a wall or

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.420 
this isn't actually set into a wall or
anything<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.590> looks<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.890> open<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
anything so it looks really open at the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
anything so it looks really open at the
moment<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.090> that's<00:00:33.239> basically<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.020> can

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
moment but that's basically so it can

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
moment but that's basically so it can
give<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.410> guys<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.739> idea<00:00:34.800> how<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> works<00:00:35.600> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
give you guys an idea how it works it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.790 
give you guys an idea how it works it
may<00:00:36.780> look<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:37.290> daunting<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
may look a little bit daunting at the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.020 
may look a little bit daunting at the
moment<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.129> some<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.370> guys<00:00:38.460> who<00:00:38.760> hasn't

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
moment as some of you guys who hasn't

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.600 
moment as some of you guys who hasn't
done<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> redstone<00:00:40.290> wiring<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.040> I'm

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
done a lot of redstone wiring but I'm

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.389 
done a lot of redstone wiring but I'm
gonna<00:00:41.760> take<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.180> through<00:00:42.270> step<00:00:42.809> by<00:00:42.840> step

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
gonna take you through step by step

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.619 
gonna take you through step by step
that's<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> first<00:00:44.700> thing<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that's the first thing you want to do is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.650 
that's the first thing you want to do is
you<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.309> put<00:00:47.309> three<00:00:47.700> pistons<00:00:48.120> above<00:00:48.539> each

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you want to put three pistons above each

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
you want to put three pistons above each
other<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.190> you'll<00:00:50.280> leave

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
other just like this and you'll leave

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.529 
other just like this and you'll leave
for<00:00:50.539> get<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.140> bucket<00:00:53.059> put<00:00:54.059> another<00:00:54.300> three

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
for get so for bucket put another three

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
for get so for bucket put another three
on<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> side<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> there's<00:00:56.219> basically<00:00:56.309> I've

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
on that side so there's basically I've

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.180 
on that side so there's basically I've
got<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> three<00:00:57.149> high<00:00:57.360> door<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> three

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
got a three high door just so the three

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.209 
got a three high door just so the three
high<00:00:59.309> ceiling<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> looks<00:01:00.180> quite<00:01:00.329> natural

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
high ceiling so that looks quite natural

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
high ceiling so that looks quite natural
it's<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> second<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.120> god

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it's the second thing you want to do god

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's the second thing you want to do god
this<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:05.630> see<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.750> basically<00:01:07.110> mirror<00:01:07.409> on

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
this that see this basically mirror on

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.050 
this that see this basically mirror on
the<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:07.860> side<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> exactly<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> same<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the other side it's exactly the same the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.660 
the other side it's exactly the same the
other<00:01:09.090> circuit<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.010> we'll<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> but

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
other circuit and then we'll do this but

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.929 
other circuit and then we'll do this but
which<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.450> oh<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
which is oh you don't to use that so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
which is oh you don't to use that so
this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> trip<00:01:15.720> wire<00:01:15.869> itself<00:01:16.200> which

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this is for the trip wire itself which

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.210 
this is for the trip wire itself which
is<00:01:16.950> obviously<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.340> came<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.530> 1.3.1<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
is obviously just came out and 1.3.1 and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.630 
is obviously just came out and 1.3.1 and
it<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.210> honestly<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.840> favorite<00:01:21.900> things

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
it is honestly one of my favorite things

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.770 
it is honestly one of my favorite things
again<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.820> very<00:01:23.880> similar<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> trip

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
again it's very similar to the trip

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
again it's very similar to the trip
wires<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:26.009> similar<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
wires that's very very similar to the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.660 
wires that's very very similar to the
pressure<00:01:27.090> pads<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.430> cool

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
pressure pads but it's just it's cool

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.010 
pressure pads but it's just it's cool
because<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.970> new<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:30.750> hard<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
because it's new and it's very hard to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
because it's new and it's very hard to
actually<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> trip<00:01:31.680> wire<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> can

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
actually see the trip wire so you can

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
actually see the trip wire so you can
disguise<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.909> quite<00:01:33.060> well<00:01:33.240> without<00:01:33.420> having

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
disguise it quite well without having

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.960 
disguise it quite well without having
those<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.079> humps<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> ground<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
those little humps on the ground so I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.690 
those little humps on the ground so I
probably<00:01:36.240> prefer<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.400> over<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
probably prefer this so go over to the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:50.340 
probably prefer this so go over to the
other<00:01:38.820> side<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.090> we'll<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> same<00:01:39.570> thing

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.569 

we<00:01:51.350> knew<00:01:51.470> when<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:51.890> put<00:01:52.070> down<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.369> string

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
we knew when you put down the string

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.710 
we knew when you put down the string
between<00:01:52.729> them<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.090> can<00:01:53.210> also<00:01:53.329> hear<00:01:53.600> them

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
between them you can also hear them

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.280 
between them you can also hear them
engage<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:54.920> working<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.290> they

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
engage see now it's working and they

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.460 
engage see now it's working and they
also<00:01:57.560> pop<00:01:57.829> up<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.100> little<00:01:58.250> bit<00:01:59.229> alright<00:02:00.229> so

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
also pop up a little bit alright so

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.929 
also pop up a little bit alright so
we've<00:02:00.590> done<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.340> first<00:02:01.579> thing<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.820> want

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
we've done this the first thing you want

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.039 
we've done this the first thing you want
to<00:02:01.970> do<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.299> want<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.479> dig<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.720> bit<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.990> a

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
to do is you want to dig a bit of a

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.010 
to do is you want to dig a bit of a
trench<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.659> want<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.869> put

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
trench like that and you want to put

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.020 
trench like that and you want to put
redstone<00:02:06.470> torch<00:02:06.890> under<00:02:07.039> each<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.460> them<00:02:10.030> take

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
redstone torch under each of them take

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.380 
redstone torch under each of them take
this<00:02:11.180> around<00:02:11.920> everyone<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.970> do<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.300> a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
this around everyone can do this in a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.970 
this around everyone can do this in a
different<00:02:14.510> way<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.380> how<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.950> to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
different way but this is how I like to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.140 
different way but this is how I like to
do<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.310> personally<00:02:17.050> put<00:02:18.050> down<00:02:18.200> one<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.410> these

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
do it personally put down one of these

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.789 
do it personally put down one of these
if<00:02:20.150> didn't<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:21.260> but<00:02:21.530> here<00:02:21.769> goes

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
if didn't know this but here goes

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.680 
if didn't know this but here goes
towards<00:02:22.400> with<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.580> currents<00:02:22.910> coming<00:02:22.940> from<00:02:23.299> so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
towards with the currents coming from so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.600 
towards with the currents coming from so
since<00:02:24.200> you're<00:02:24.319> triggering<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.769> carrots

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
since you're triggering this carrots

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.740 
since you're triggering this carrots
coming<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.180> through<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> circuit

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
coming this way through the circuit

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.460 
coming this way through the circuit
obviously<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.140> basically

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
obviously just like that and basically

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.900 
obviously just like that and basically
we<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.069> for<00:02:34.190> all<00:02:34.340> four<00:02:34.390> parts<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.480> it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:48.620 

Oh<00:02:43.650> fancy

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.390 

I<00:02:50.640> was<00:02:51.640> then<00:02:51.760> go<00:02:51.910> back<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.300> more<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:54.220> getting

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
I was then go back one more it's getting

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.130 
I was then go back one more it's getting
a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.520> bit<00:02:54.700> confused<00:02:54.850> which<00:02:55.300> wasn't<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
a little bit confused which wasn't the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.830 
a little bit confused which wasn't the
best<00:03:01.740> just<00:03:02.740> like<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.330> then<00:03:04.540> from<00:03:04.720> this

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
best just like that and then from this

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.170 
best just like that and then from this
one<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.770> put<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.010> up<00:03:06.820> like<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.030> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
one you can just put it up like that and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.210 
one you can just put it up like that and
then<00:03:07.360> we'll<00:03:07.450> open<00:03:07.540> those<00:03:07.840> top<00:03:08.050> two<00:03:08.230> or<00:03:08.470> just

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
then we'll open those top two or just

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.530 
then we'll open those top two or just
finish<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.550> off<00:03:09.730> at<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:09.910> side<00:03:10.120> first<00:03:10.330> before

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
finish it off at this side first before

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:26.050 
finish it off at this side first before
I<00:03:10.660> go<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:10.990> do<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:12.130> other<00:03:12.250> ones

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.740 

basically<00:03:26.810> I've<00:03:27.050> got<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:27.380> here<00:03:27.650> which<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:28.010> a

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
basically I've got this here which is a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.790 
basically I've got this here which is a
repeater<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.840> they're<00:03:30.110> basically<00:03:30.470> slows

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
repeater and they're basically slows

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.160 
repeater and they're basically slows
down<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.160> circuit<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:32.270> it's<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.480> good<00:03:32.660> timing

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
down the circuit so it's a good timing

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.530 
down the circuit so it's a good timing
so<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:34.730> because<00:03:34.940> I've<00:03:35.060> got<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:35.390> block

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so just because I've got a one block

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.440 
so just because I've got a one block
away<00:03:35.569> it's<00:03:35.900> basically<00:03:36.260> they'll<00:03:37.190> open<00:03:37.520> just<00:03:38.300> as

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
away it's basically they'll open just as

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.940 
away it's basically they'll open just as
you<00:03:38.600> walk<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.140> door<00:03:39.260> which<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.650> how<00:03:39.890> you

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
you walk to the door which is how you

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.410 
you walk to the door which is how you
want<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.340> don't<00:03:40.490> want<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.700> sit<00:03:41.270> there

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
want it you don't want to sit there

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:55.059 
want it you don't want to sit there
waiting<00:03:41.660> for<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.110> come<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.739> was<00:03:54.950> very

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
waiting for it to come but it was very

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.260 
waiting for it to come but it was very
very<00:03:55.190> simple<00:03:55.670> once<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:55.850> get<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.030> hang<00:03:56.180> of

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
very simple once you get the hang of

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.130 
very simple once you get the hang of
redstone<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:58.420> I'm<00:03:59.420> sure<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.690> guys<00:03:59.840> will<00:03:59.870> all

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
redstone and I'm sure you guys will all

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.720 
redstone and I'm sure you guys will all
be<00:04:00.230> making<00:04:00.560> cool<00:04:00.980> contraptions<00:04:01.519> in<00:04:01.610> the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
be making cool contraptions in the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.660 
be making cool contraptions in the
future<00:04:04.360> it's<00:04:05.360> like<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:07.130> once<00:04:07.310> that's<00:04:07.459> all

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
future it's like that so once that's all

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.370 
future it's like that so once that's all
done<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.450> next<00:04:08.660> thing<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.870> have<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.019> do<00:04:09.200> is

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
done the next thing you have to do is

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.199 
done the next thing you have to do is
you<00:04:09.590> take<00:04:10.280> out<00:04:10.400> those<00:04:10.610> two

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
you take out those two

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.520 
you take out those two
I'm<00:04:11.420> sorry<00:04:11.660> issue<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.050> take<00:04:12.200> out<00:04:12.319> load

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
I'm sorry issue that you take out load

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.370 
I'm sorry issue that you take out load
that<00:04:12.769> one<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:13.280> one<00:04:13.910> better<00:04:14.090> do<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:15.260> goes

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
that one there one better do it it goes

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.479 
that one there one better do it it goes
up<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.800> one<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.160> engages<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:18.489> just

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
up to that one so that engages it just

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.290 
up to that one so that engages it just
do<00:04:19.579> this<00:04:19.729> x4<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.060> same<00:04:20.239> on<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.419> other<00:04:20.479> side

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
do this x4 the same on the other side

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.670 
do this x4 the same on the other side
like<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.750> then<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.380> can<00:04:24.470> basically

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
like that and then you can basically

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.710 
like that and then you can basically
just<00:04:25.570> chucking<00:04:26.570> some<00:04:28.030> bits<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.479> wall<00:04:29.690> that

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
just chucking some bits of the wall that

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.030 
just chucking some bits of the wall that
you<00:04:30.050> want<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:32.000> now<00:04:32.350> soon<00:04:33.350> as<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.530> walk<00:04:33.710> up<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.979> us

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
you want and now soon as I walk up to us

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.150 
you want and now soon as I walk up to us
you<00:04:34.880> go<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.330> works<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.669> that's<00:04:38.360> pretty<00:04:38.600> much<00:04:38.690> a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
you go it works so that's pretty much a

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.670 
you go it works so that's pretty much a
tripwire<00:04:40.160> piston<00:04:41.120> door<00:04:41.300> circuit<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.470> I'm

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
tripwire piston door circuit and I'm

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.290 
tripwire piston door circuit and I'm
gonna<00:04:42.890> cut<00:04:43.160> me<00:04:43.490> out<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.700> see<00:04:43.880> what<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.150> looks

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
gonna cut me out to see what it looks

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.090 
gonna cut me out to see what it looks
like<00:04:44.390> when<00:04:44.570> they<00:04:44.660> said<00:04:44.810> she<00:04:44.900> hadn't<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:45.440> made

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
like when they said she hadn't and made

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.520 
like when they said she hadn't and made
sort<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.400> into<00:04:46.640> a<00:04:46.669> house<00:04:46.880> environment<00:04:47.530> alright

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
sort of into a house environment alright

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.600 
sort of into a house environment alright
guys<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:48.890> can<00:04:48.979> see<00:04:49.100> I've<00:04:49.220> covered<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:49.520> all

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
guys so you can see I've covered it all

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.170 
guys so you can see I've covered it all
up<00:04:49.760> pretty<00:04:49.970> much

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
up pretty much

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.659 
up pretty much
so<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:51.080> basically<00:04:51.470> just<00:04:51.560> shows<00:04:52.370> what<00:04:52.610> it

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
so this basically just shows what it

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.920 
so this basically just shows what it
would<00:04:52.760> be<00:04:52.820> like<00:04:52.850> in<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.120> hallway<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.720> house

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
would be like in the hallway of a house

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.120 
would be like in the hallway of a house
or<00:04:54.140> something<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.470> can't<00:04:54.650> tell<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.919> doors

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
or something you can't tell the doors

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.279 
or something you can't tell the doors
there<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:56.479> only<00:04:56.600> thing<00:04:56.690> is<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:56.960> can<00:04:57.080> see<00:04:57.169> the

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
there the only thing is you can see the

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.740 
there the only thing is you can see the
little<00:04:57.470> hole<00:04:57.680> here<00:04:58.010> but<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:59.180> me<00:04:59.300> that's<00:04:59.450> better

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
little hole here but to me that's better

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.659 
little hole here but to me that's better
than<00:04:59.900> having<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.260> pressure<00:05:00.890> pads<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.370> stick

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
than having the pressure pads that stick

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.670 
than having the pressure pads that stick
up<00:05:01.789> a<00:05:01.880> lot<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:02.780> it's<00:05:02.930> not<00:05:03.080> it's<00:05:03.260> not<00:05:03.380> too<00:05:03.530> bad

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
up a lot so it's not it's not too bad

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.310 
up a lot so it's not it's not too bad
and<00:05:03.919> as<00:05:04.700> soon<00:05:04.820> as<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:04.970> walk<00:05:05.120> over<00:05:05.240> we're<00:05:06.140> still

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
work and I haven't covered up all this

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.029 
work and I haven't covered up all this
you<00:05:08.960> can<00:05:09.080> just<00:05:09.229> hide<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.560> in<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.710> back<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.979> a

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
you can just hide it in the back of a

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.969 
you can just hide it in the back of a
wall<00:05:10.280> it's<00:05:10.910> not<00:05:11.060> too<00:05:11.240> big<00:05:11.479> circuit<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.110> it's

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
wall it's not too big circuit but it's

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.670 
wall it's not too big circuit but it's
differently<00:05:13.370> there<00:05:14.350> yeah<00:05:15.350> it's<00:05:15.470> very<00:05:15.620> very
