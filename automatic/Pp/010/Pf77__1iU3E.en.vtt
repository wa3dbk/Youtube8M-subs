00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.350
 I'm a bunch of kids, we're back 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.600
 in the channel we are in a new gameplay 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.669
 commented on this case we will try a 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.620
 pretty entertaining topic that I when 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.929
 I saw it because I said go this I have to 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.299
 tell the subscribers prices and 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.430
 there is nothing more and nothing less than a theme 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.900
 about supplies about more or less 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.720
 how many supplies do the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.400
 percentages statistics and other 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.080
 the supplies that you know there are in 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.910
 advance orphan so good if I do not know 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.620
 what is a supply that I doubt it is 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.410
 a kind of little box that you 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.690
 touches in each certain games in which 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.640
 You can find different models of 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.489
 the normal souls clothes to customize 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.100
 your character and other objects to 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.420
 improve your game and so on then 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.670
 are going to treat today all the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.230
 statistics and all the percentages and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.930
 the odd theory about more or less 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.760
 when these supplies come out that 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.380
 nobody knows one hundred percent but 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.690
 well let's talk a little about 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.489
 statistics about everything so good what 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.280
 first in supplies that is more or 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.970
 minus what you usually touch 100 55 for 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 hundred of times they touch level stuff 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.420
 cadet the 30 professional level things 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.020
 and 15 only 15 percent touching 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.640
 objects or elite weapons then not 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.530
 is removed these statistics are not 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.090
 taken out of the game code since 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.040
 nobody has the game code only the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.440
 developers but they are taken out 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.740
 of 200 supplies of a kind of 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.900
 test with 200 supplies and so that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.460
 they saw more or less that more 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.980
 less in the percentages are percentages 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.690
 quite normal not things that can 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.300
 programming a human is not something very well 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.369
 rare and the truth if it seems that he has 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.070
 could any human be programmed 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.070
 good 55 percent after 30 that is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.960
 about half of 55 and then 15 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.430
 they are more or less normal fixes 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.770
 this moment that the package takes a 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.180
 little time I wanted to throw the paladin or the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.560
 wall bird but I shot this I say rather 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.020
 I leave quickly and I just had it 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.780
 loaded here my ally said my mother I 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.700
 normal good what else is for what it is 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.200
 saying that they are percentages more or less 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.920
 credible are not very rare percentages 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.050
 but hey there I leave it 30 155 percent 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 30 percent cadet professional 15 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.129
 percent elite 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.950
 of the theme of clothing weapons 2x pib and 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.250
 fast supplies and other the 45 by 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.140
 a hundred times they touch clothes worth 45 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.569
 percent of supplies there are clothes 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.359
 carrying inside it please 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.220
 takes a pretty white streak the 35th 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.400
 hundred of the times that you educate a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.010
 supply you get a gun and 20% 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.370
 fast supplies or 2 xp you already know that 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.280
 you touch clothes weapons or cards that give you 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.359
 2 xp fast and different supplies 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 things like those 45 minutes 50 10 25 and 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:51.720
 all kinds of minutes not then then 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.099
 let's move on to the elite weapons or the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.530
 proximity that you have I have what 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.750
 elite monkey weapons that is what a weapon 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.639
 elite in a supply you have an 11 by 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.879
 a hundred chances of that 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.040
 occur that is to say almost 11 match 11 of 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.409
 possibilities you have that when there 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.930
 supply you have an elite weapon that 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.609
 have two or more elite weapons is very very 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.139
 small 2 percent chance 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.310
 also at least I think that I never 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.620
 has gone from commenting on the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.500
 comments if it has happened to you 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.629
 more than three weapons that's already I think that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.730
 has not touched anyone is to say is that 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.090
 it's almost impossible I'm not that possibility 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.090
 now but almost almost it is impossible 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.940
 then nobody really knows 100% how 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.650
 the supplies come out how to activate 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.090
 when they appear, there is no rule 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.290
 because well that's written in the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.060
 Game code and game code 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.060
 they only have the developers as they already 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.860
 I say good more or less is a weapon 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.260
 every 45 minutes that's like the theory 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.360
 more supported is the one that the least 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.150
 everyone thinks a weapon every 45 is 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.549
 saying a supply every 45 minutes is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.260
 as the most respected in hills lomas 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.450
 said I think that at least so 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.220
 except that works for me note 45 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.739
 minutes or so I get a 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.530
 supply after there are new theories 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.720
 about more or less where the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.909
 supplies how they are made and it would be the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.980
 next minus score per minute 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.420
 more supplies situation for me 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.579
 then in the score two points of 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.220
 the px that you get every minute and I 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.100
 I have it good for 300 and something 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.930
 and well, if you have less score 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
 per minute means that it is assumed that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.700
 you're worse not this is kind of 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.410
 rule not if they have less score per 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.150
 minute you 're supposed to be worse and if you're 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.670
 worse are supposed to have weapons and things 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.360
 better for you to say host 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.460
 good things 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.990
 let's play more let's go to such for 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.020
 example if there are people who would get rid of 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.460
 fast if you give for example you have a 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.170
 very low score per minute you're very 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.780
 bad and giving you a pretty good weapon 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.370
 Well, the truth is that it encourages you if you play 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.590
 more so that you do not get discouraged and over 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.870
 of 100 guys these are basically the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.640
 theories I think it 's pretty enough 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.340
 more I trust a lot more in that of a 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.810
 supply every 45 minutes to let me 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.590
 for the comments if this happens to you more 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.290
 or less to you 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.600
 unai favorites thank you a lot and we 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.600
 we see the next video bye bye
