00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.819 

so<00:00:00.570> let's<00:00:00.780> take<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.020> look<00:00:01.199> at<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.410> fingering

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
so let's take a look at the fingering

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.539 
so let's take a look at the fingering
for<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.159> first<00:00:02.490> zone<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.300> harmonic<00:00:03.780> minor

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
for the first zone of harmonic minor

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.970 
for the first zone of harmonic minor
there's<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.759> root<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.450> scale<00:00:09.980> there's

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
there's the root of the scale there's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610 
there's the root of the scale there's
that<00:00:11.130> raised<00:00:11.370> seventh<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.230> now<00:00:13.230> I'm<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.559> to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that raised seventh one now I'm going to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.740 
that raised seventh one now I'm going to
do<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> slight<00:00:14.340> position<00:00:14.880> shift<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:16.410> fret<00:00:16.740> four

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
do a slight position shift to fret four

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.099 
do a slight position shift to fret four
and<00:00:18.750> now<00:00:18.840> we're<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> go<00:00:19.199> back<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:21.109> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and now we're going to go back up and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
and now we're going to go back up and
that's<00:00:22.800> stretch<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> people<00:00:24.000> find

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
that's stretch a lot of people find

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.400 
that's stretch a lot of people find
difficult<00:00:26.240> okay<00:00:27.269> there<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.750> some<00:00:27.900> alternate

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
difficult okay there are some alternate

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.560 
difficult okay there are some alternate
ways<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> play<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.369> scale<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.330> mode

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
ways to play this scale in this mode

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
ways to play this scale in this mode
zone<00:00:31.309> basically<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.369> involves<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.820> little<00:00:33.030> bit

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
zone basically it involves a little bit

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
zone basically it involves a little bit
more<00:00:33.450> shifting<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> first

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
more shifting so that was the first

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.060 
more shifting so that was the first
shift<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> fret<00:00:40.320> upward<00:00:45.530> okay<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.829> did

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
shift to the fret upward okay so I did

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
shift to the fret upward okay so I did
this<00:00:47.219> shift<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:48.289> back<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.700> chord<00:00:51.210> shapes

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
this shift here back so the chord shapes

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.810 
this shift here back so the chord shapes
are<00:00:51.690> gonna<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.960> looking<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.410> our<00:00:52.800> here's<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
are gonna be looking at our here's the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.069 
are gonna be looking at our here's the
standard<00:00:54.890> D<00:00:55.890> minor<00:00:56.280> shape<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.570> mode<00:00:57.780> zone

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
standard D minor shape of the mode zone

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
standard D minor shape of the mode zone
okay<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.190> turn<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> into<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> minor

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
okay and we can turn it into a minor

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
okay and we can turn it into a minor
major<00:01:00.660> seven<00:01:01.100> by<00:01:02.100> taking<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.579> note<00:01:02.850> down

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
major seven by taking this note down

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.710 
major seven by taking this note down
here

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520 

okay<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:09.040> that's<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:10.150> couple<00:01:10.780> ways<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.110> play

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
okay so that's a couple ways to play

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.720 
okay so that's a couple ways to play
that<00:01:11.860> shape<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.380> next<00:01:14.680> shape<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.340> seven

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
that shape the next shape is the seven

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.820 
that shape the next shape is the seven
diminished<00:01:16.120> seven<00:01:18.270> okay<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.290> based<00:01:20.560> on

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
diminished seven okay that is based on

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.800 
diminished seven okay that is based on
the<00:01:21.610> seven<00:01:21.940> scale<00:01:22.300> degree

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the seven scale degree

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.400 
the seven scale degree
if<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:24.120> don't<00:01:25.120> know<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.300> lot<00:01:25.630> about<00:01:25.660> diminished

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
if you don't know a lot about diminished

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:35.130 
if you don't know a lot about diminished
seventh<00:01:26.740> chords<00:01:27.100> they're<00:01:27.340> movable<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.540> for

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
seventh chords they're movable so for

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.640 
seventh chords they're movable so for
melodic<00:01:35.560> minor<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:37.390> gonna<00:01:37.660> do<00:01:37.840> C<00:01:38.170> melodic

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
melodic minor I'm gonna do C melodic

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.890 
melodic minor I'm gonna do C melodic
minor<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:40.000> there's<00:01:40.180> only<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.450> one<00:01:40.720> note

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
minor because there's only a one note

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.290 
minor because there's only a one note
difference<00:01:41.440> between<00:01:42.400> that<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.000> major

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
difference between that and the major

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.590 
difference between that and the major
scale<00:01:43.869> C<00:01:44.260> major<00:01:44.470> scale<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.400> here's<00:01:45.700> C<00:01:45.940> major<00:01:46.210> if

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
scale C major scale so here's C major if

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.600 
scale C major scale so here's C major if
you<00:01:47.140> recall<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.830> first<00:01:48.010> major<00:01:48.310> mode<00:01:53.550> now<00:01:54.550> I'm

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
you recall the first major mode now I'm

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.160 
you recall the first major mode now I'm
going<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.820> take<00:01:54.970> all<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.330> threes<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.720> that

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
going to take all the threes of that

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
going to take all the threes of that
scale<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.800> make<00:01:56.890> them<00:01:57.040> flat<00:01:57.280> threes<00:01:59.190> there's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
scale and make them flat threes there's

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:09.180 
scale and make them flat threes there's
the<00:02:00.400> first<00:02:00.580> one<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.440> there's<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.770> third<00:02:08.950> one

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
the first one and there's the third one

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.570 
the first one and there's the third one
and<00:02:09.810> there's<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.899> alternate<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.890> fives<00:02:12.220> on

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and there's the alternate the fives on

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.620 
and there's the alternate the fives on
there<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.489> there's<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.880> first<00:02:16.120> alternative

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
there so there's the first alternative

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.290 
there so there's the first alternative
five<00:02:17.459> second<00:02:18.459> alternate<00:02:18.910> five<00:02:19.200> all<00:02:20.200> right<00:02:21.300> II

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
five second alternate five all right II

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
five second alternate five all right II
minor<00:02:23.200> shaped<00:02:23.680> C<00:02:24.160> minor<00:02:24.400> chord<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.780> chord

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
minor shaped C minor chord is the chord

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.229 
minor shaped C minor chord is the chord
that<00:02:26.640> corresponds<00:02:27.640> with<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.850> mode<00:02:28.090> zone<00:02:30.239> you

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
that corresponds with this mode zone you

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.880 
that corresponds with this mode zone you
might<00:02:31.420> want<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.630> play<00:02:31.810> minor<00:02:32.080> major<00:02:32.380> seven<00:02:34.890> so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
might want to play minor major seven so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.330 
might want to play minor major seven so
it's<00:02:36.040> C<00:02:36.430> GB

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.119 

flat<00:02:39.670> G<00:02:40.330> see<00:02:41.110> that's<00:02:41.410> what<00:02:41.530> I'm<00:02:41.590> playing<00:02:41.769> here

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
flat G see that's what I'm playing here

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.390 
flat G see that's what I'm playing here
and<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.569> reason<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.930> didn't<00:02:44.200> put<00:02:44.349> them<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and the reason I didn't put them in the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.220 
and the reason I didn't put them in the
profiles<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.420> mode<00:02:46.629> zone<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.050> because

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
profiles for this mode zone is because

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.320 
profiles for this mode zone is because
all<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.430> shapes<00:02:48.670> are<00:02:48.910> found<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.269> the

all of the shapes are found in the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.229 
all of the shapes are found in the
harmonic<00:02:49.780> minor<00:02:49.930> mode<00:02:50.890> zone<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.550> just<00:02:51.790> apply
