low-speed info this baby will just creep
along<00:00:59.479> like<00:01:00.479> this<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.979> have<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> ability

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
along like this and I have the ability

they're not wherever the magnets are in
the<00:01:05.940> track<00:01:08.270> also<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.509> can<00:01:09.780> adjust<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> sound<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the track also I can adjust the sound to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
the track also I can adjust the sound to
two<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:11.610> levels<00:01:11.789> and<00:01:12.090> select<00:01:12.840> between

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
two different levels and select between

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:31.190 
two different levels and select between
them<00:01:13.380> myself<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:15.770> that's<00:01:16.770> why<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.340> BCC<00:01:30.200> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
