00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you a better form a man would you make

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.779 
you a better form a man would you make
the<00:00:21.150> stick<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.109> cut<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> off<00:00:24.859> cool<00:00:25.859> okay

it<00:01:16.840> comes<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.170> with<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.650> risk<00:01:17.860> training<00:01:18.220> do

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
it comes to with the risk training do

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
it comes to with the risk training do
high<00:01:19.000> reps<00:01:19.240> or<00:01:19.360> low<00:01:19.630> reps<00:01:19.979> about<00:01:20.979> 10<00:01:21.760> reps<00:01:21.970> 6<00:01:22.630> 10

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.540 
reps I don't think it'll work that way
if<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.080> go<00:01:26.259> for<00:01:26.500> around<00:01:26.560> 6<00:01:26.979> reps<00:01:27.220> that<00:01:27.369> won't

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
if you go for around 6 reps that won't

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.260 
if you go for around 6 reps that won't
work<00:01:27.700> as<00:01:27.880> well<00:01:31.890> 10<00:01:32.890> reps<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.280> fine<00:01:33.520> 20<00:01:34.060> reps
