 independent states this as a place 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 how to know is associate 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.880
 member of the community of independent 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 states despite this over the period 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 past tense and our previous 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 meetings and interaction frameworks with 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 adults will depend on the mass will give ost i 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.460
 overall consistently and i would say and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.550
 report with the reached agreements 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.440

 Iâ€™ll add it up like a troll the priest 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 that is, we cannot close 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 probably eyes on ti difficult process 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.159
 which we wait for everything and in some regions 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.850
 world including space 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.610
 Commonwealth of Independent States 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.580
 that is, their analysis today requires 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.820
 probably weighted already 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.150
 such artists approaches sapporo wife 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 experience developed by our countries 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.850
 cooperation tradition 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 solving all difficult issues exactly 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.470
 through respectful partnership dialogue 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.649
 and it is important here probably need to save 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.330
 all the same positive focus 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.420
 action with cargo 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.520
 independent state which is always 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.520
 built on the principles of equality 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.590
 mutual respect 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.080
 good neighborliness and goodwill of all 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.490
 participants and 3 places 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.250
 convinced that the potential of the CIS here is 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.590
 can and should be used for 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 maintaining a regional balance 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.150
 security non- conflict 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.140
 approval of negotiation instruments 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.450
 how here on here is straight lego means them 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.370
 decisions based on this 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.890
 it means probably 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.959
 create a system efficient 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.240
 mechanism and political consultation 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.720
 touching on security issues and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.030
 general director on cis space 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.360

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.120
 touch trade and economic 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.769
 activities and here we are in reality 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.330

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.080
 questions on 4 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.019
 transport logistics and several other 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.470
 questions in principle those question which 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.630
 set today for Denmark too 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.990
