 Many looks to interest you

 I said I looked numerous to you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.809
 interest in diseases and more 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.429
 especially to the troubles 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.599
 psychological and to tell the truth 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'm interested in a lot 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.750
 even though we are concretely 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.100
 big yannick to interest us in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.720
 it's fascinating to see how 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.029
 mother nature can have fun with our 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.390
 mind and suddenly it's the only one who have 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 Rights 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.039
 we will not laugh because it's bad if 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.180
 I assure you people are suffering 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.250
 to call sarah top the border line 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.599
 karpukhin is nothing top kind yes it's 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.340
 too cool I have a better cool but 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.920
 put talent Jerusalem artichokes tecau what to go 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.090
 in passing that the game top 10 here I 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 do them for you so you can you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.730
 exempted in the comments of 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 nothing is free I make you win 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 short time despite the formulation a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.289
 little special we go today 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.039
 we interest a top 5 syndrome 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.640
 psychiatric 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:01.140
 the weirdest number 5 the syndrome 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.850
 of capgras more commonly called the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.350
 delusion division of Cape look-alikes grace 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 this psychiatric disorder is very 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.450
 strange 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 to tell you the truth, I have trouble representing myself 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.119
 to imagine what it must do and you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.119
 will understand why 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.670
 indeed the people with this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.780
 trouble seems to believe that all his 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 close that it seems quite 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.020
 recognize are replaced by 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 look-alikes totally identical physically 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.630
 so he recognizes people but does not 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.250
 do not recognize their identity 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.600
 looking at his loved one the patient will say 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.820
 simply recognize the person 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 but that's not her but just a 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.659
 double this syndrome detail in 1923 by 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.159
 joseph capgras is often the fruit 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 of a bipolarity of a depression of a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.119
 schizophrenia or brain damage 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 and the reactions of patients to their 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 loved ones can be yes pretty violent 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.100
 we can say alone is driven by 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 hallucinations supposedly visual by 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.710
 elsewhere because the patient seems all to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 have his family recognized 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 phone it is only disturbed 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310
 when they see the person in front 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.180
 be careful shit joke and if the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 phone the person in front of him 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.160
 he reacts how thank you thank you I know 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.510
 that I repeat this syndrome would be due 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.770
 as I wanted to say to a lesion 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.420
 brain and the affected person 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.010
 lacking emotion in face of a known face 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.530
 deduce that the person in question 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.670
 is an impostor and it's awful 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.020
 imagine you see a person that you 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.630
 love but you stay totally 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.730
 indifferent to her but it's ignoble 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.060
 despicable number 4 the hand syndrome 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.060
 foreigner 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.430
 you have probably already seen short 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.260
 feature films or films in which a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.400
 kind to little concon to be polite was losing 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.580
 control of his hand and have fun at 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.780
 do enough obscene way gestures yeah 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.480
 good one of a good big handjob 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.709
 we understood that the only sheikh that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.270
 really exists and that people are 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.220
 really touched by that is kurt 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.330
 golstein who in 1908 described for the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.950
 first time these symptoms 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.970
 following the patient's statement that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.709
 felt that his left arm 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.690
 did not belong to him afterwards 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.520
 Other cases occurred and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.840
 description has been expanded the person 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.250
 affected by this syndrome to the actual 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.020
 impression that it has me and alienated 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.310
 disobedient that she lost the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.959
 control while she has not lost 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.310
 sensitivity and it even happens 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.510
 sometimes that samalut disobedient 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.920
 that they are aware of it the least 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.850
 world for example she can have fun at 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.230
 to make fingers of honor to passersby 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.840
 and as long as the person does not 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.130
 do not see it moved me beautiful she did not 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.700
 will not take into account what is 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.950
 to happen 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.269
 you imagine the situation the problems that 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.769
 can attract and must not combine 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.790
 roof syndrome makes it go down 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.500
 on the spot otherwise that in short it's like 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.269
 if the hand had a clean will and 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.890
 was completely independent of 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.150
 the individual is assumed that this syndrome 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.320
 is usually due to an injury of 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.850
 callous body that connects the two 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.200
 hemispheres of the brain an attack 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.160
 brain or cancer that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.260
 would affect the motor functions 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.850
 ask for good I will not develop anymore because 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.900
 it would be far too far explained and 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.190
 I would risk doing a lot 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.390
 of errors I invite you as 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.860
 usually to inquire by you 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.180
 even going to see the sources in the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.290
 description good to finish this is 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.760
 absolutely not proven but some 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.720
 say that the gestures as for them would be 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.370
 the symbol of what the person 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.780
 would like in his heart of hearts but that 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.579
 his inhibition and his moral conscience 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.920
 prohibited wholesale if you want to make a 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.650
 soap opera you do not do it normal 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.870
 you hold back but the hand she she the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.870
 will make number 3 the technophilia skin 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.999
 so he gore them but not the glove but 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.769
 if that's the name there it's gore 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.670
 mental and physical people good style 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.280
 the jump 1 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.450
 he closed me your big hangover or 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.040
 more exactly it is a disorder 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.299
 neurological in which a person does not 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.889
 wants to be amputated one or more of 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.989
 its members still functional and 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.909
 now we wonder why 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.000
 no because it seems completely where we are 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.829
 okay and really we do not know 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.060
 the person just wants to be 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.539
 amputate kahn limbs does not seem 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.769
 suit him 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.910
 it is thought that this is due to a disorder 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.289
 identitary identity 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.970
 that the person can not manage to 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.710
 determine who she is and who she wants 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.180
 correct an anatomical anomaly for 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.430
 to be able to meet or even to 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.110
 find for some cases that's it 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.949
 more seriously yes because we have to 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.270
 to be serious before it goes 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.470
 teasing because it's really not funny 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.880
 the skin is often techies 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.620
 associated with abnormalities of the cortex 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.940
 prefrontal although most often if 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.990
 the story the lived of the person who 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.430
 seems to play the greatest importance 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.720
 against it is practically nothing 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.550
 the more the origin of the disorder and everything seems 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.810
 quite hypothetical and that's enough 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.340
 creepy because the worst in history 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.660
 is that a person who can not 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.070
 amputated by a surgeon will end 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.389
 by his put is herself and in 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.150
 come out satisfied 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.889
 and that's scary fat number two the 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.509
 good lima syndrome that one does not 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.039
 suffer no one on the contrary he would do 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.039
 almost good 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.420
 So it's more for the anecdote because 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.100
 that he is funny this syndrome 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.840
 it's the exact opposite of the syndrome of 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.060
 stockholm if the kidnappers who 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.590
 become friends or even fraternity 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.900
 for their hostages it's beautiful anyway 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.160
 in the purchase the wacker hostages love them 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.970
 good but do not forget that this 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.740
 implies that the takers 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.790
 of hostages finishing all aprilia so 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.200
 it's not guilt it's a 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.040
 true attachment because they are ready 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.390
 to go to jail and forget 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.460
 temporarily for their ideologies 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.140
 unknown they had to kill ah bah 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.820
 yeah that's hot this syndrome was done 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.620
 to know during a kidnapping in 1996 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.610
 in which the Japanese ambassador enters 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.470
 others in lima in peru 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.520
 ba got kidnapped was not stupid 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.520
 you understood the context of the sentence 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.700
 the kidnappers relaxed 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.170
 so regularly hostages over 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.360
 days and could not kill the hostages 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.800
 as it should in case of attack and 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.720
 all because of the sympathy that 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.920
 inspires them and the hostages number one the 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.920
 alice syndrome in wonderland 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.230
 he's really putting in syndrome 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.150
 as you can imagine 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.680
 no it's not true because the person 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.810
 undermining his sense of altered touch 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.620
 and big hallucinations 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.510
 people suffering from this syndrome 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.430
 suffer among other things the effects of 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.660
 micro psy and the psychic macro wholesale they 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.740
 can hallucinate see things more 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.540
 large or smaller than they are 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.950
 are or feel smaller or more 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.419
 great they are they feel 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.660
 so things like he sees them and 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.070
 it's rather or is disturbing imagine 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.930
 for example a stuffed animal become a bear 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.860
 or a person become a playmobil and 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.120
 it's because there is better for 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.470
 interact with the world I think 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.970
 but hey, since everybody is waiting for him 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.080
 o'neal was good like that you have 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.520
 the impression of having a big bright y 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.830
 see the mark when you are happy 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.210
 we can continue this syndrome changes 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.770
 so the perception of space and of 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.900
 itself and takes its name from the work of 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.130
 lewis carroll he was described for the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.200
 first time by the way by john 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.640
 thode in 1955 which and that's why the 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.060
 syndrome is also called the syndrome of 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.620
 todd 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.730
 it is often linked to migraines that 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.710
 had also lewis carroll for 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.090
 the anecdote some even assume it 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.680
 was inspired by his migraine episodes 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.270
 to write certain passages of his 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.800
 book or taking hard drugs and 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.190
 children seem more sensitive to this 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.720
 syndrome 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.250
 finally not after taking drugs 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.970
 hard 1 in any case seeing this kind 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.620
 mental disorders 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.450
 we can quickly understand that our 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.980
 brain is a fantastic tool but 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.470
 also very fragile and that we 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.700
 can understand it at our expense here 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.200
 the video is over I invite you to 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.670

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.950
 chain if it's not already done
