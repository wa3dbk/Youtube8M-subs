great<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.549> think<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.060> play<00:03:09.299> style<00:03:09.629> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
great I think this is a play style and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.210 
great I think this is a play style and
what<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.019> need<00:03:10.139> to<00:03:10.230> do<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:10.440> your<00:03:10.560> team<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:10.950> this

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
what you need to do on your team so this

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.500 
what you need to do on your team so this
is<00:03:11.370> an<00:03:11.519> option<00:03:11.909> too<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.209> want<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.389> pick

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.039 
either straight up defense or straight
up<00:03:16.349> offense<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.430> then<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.329> they're<00:03:18.599> going<00:03:18.840> if

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
up offense and then if they're going if

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.479 
up offense and then if they're going if
you're<00:03:19.139> going<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.410> against<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:19.769> really<00:03:20.129> tanky
