00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.680
 very good 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.330
 serious good champion so we 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.809
 spend the last phase now mate 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.149
 top-level training so how 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.100
 says bad champions or weak 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.660
 world champions do not happen therefore we 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.670
 tuned for the most 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 the more finished bbc is the most 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 prestigious version of the battle as rahim 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.070
 getting ready and how he is ready and how set up 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 how does he feel just on top 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.109
 level so we have it is not easy 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.000
 beautiful words are you see for yourself all 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.229
 fight well and everything about training 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.220
 thanks to our managers, we have everything 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.360
 provided by 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.990
 so we spend at the highest level 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.380
 fight will count on a knockout or you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.330
 you know what basically i like ex myself 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 wbc world champion yes i'm on 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.799
 order 1 feb 17 more just and so 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 I also always say so 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.689
 I would like to say so we anyway 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 any boxer even a puncher he should 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.619
 tune in to 12 rounds and pain but 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 The course will be there where you can and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 how can 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.020
 or can this happen this as 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.020
 it says everything will be seen in battle and in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.119
 this moment we're just getting ready for 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.640
 blue to all 12 rounds 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.420
 survive I just think since my 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.280
 the last battle 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 rahim finished on points he will 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.340
 try to repair myself 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.530
 this is the minimum 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.349
 always good when a boxer is tuned 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.709
 minimum all 12 rounds register job 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.200
 for someone it's just for us all 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.599
 relief what quickly finished fast 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.580
 the game will be nice but if it is not 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.129
 then the boxer should just be ready 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.040
 start rounds so i think thats 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.060
 ready let's remember your milestones 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.310
 great career 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.440
 still, you held the title of 8 years wd 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.390
 easy breeze please remember the assault 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.599
 still the rule went into battle in the project 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:43.510
 himself with the progress I'm going to tell you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:47.250
 why this mine was 18 and 19 of 19 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.950
 world championship ie 18 defended 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.260
 happened this is not just mark in 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.660
 America sent there to be honest I 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 i'm i'm not going now something past 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.129
 there is no stirring well, and then as a judge 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.819
 I treated him not to court in the idea of ​​a gift 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.670
 fall from 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.209
 but jesus yo stop account just open 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.709
 wanted beautifully I apologize for the expression 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.090
 remove or fuse the way it happened 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.370
 top because if I became 19 19 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.560
 once would become a world champion ie 18 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.079
 Once a special zone, I would become new 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.750
 world record holder in lightweight 61 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.549
 a kilogram I would break a record 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.980
 Guinness on this I put forward this 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.049
 I went through the fight and I remembered well 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.010
 here tell from all here these knockdowns 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.769
 at least one was a real knockdown here mom 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.750
 this is the first person to date 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.959
 After 8 years of my career, which I 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.299
 already tied up as a boxer now working 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.500
 wounded in eight years 1 you are a man who 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.660
 I ask this was sometimes he from these 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.880
 all four counted yes look 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.970
 just do and watched and have me 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.040
 spat on there then no need at all 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.959
 he just wanted to be beautifully clean here 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.569
 removed but could simply not give victory 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.250
 and that's why once again 4 1 counts me 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.750
 for what it was necessary points freitas 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.030
 shoot according to the blow 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.840
 banned yong more just tossed at 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.879
 boxing ring 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.250
 he had such a task to do that 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.709
 horrible how horrible everything will be in favor 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.260
 you now he and his work you did not 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.410
 then tried to appeal at least 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.419
 Anything they you know me sue 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.280
 some kind of appeal this is not i should 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.760
 my manager should do this 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.340
 my promoter here if he didn't do it 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.470
 boxer was me i just know how to box 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.020
 and I know how boxing will stop everything 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.360
 should do a promoter but after that fight 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.669
 you spent literally 4 months 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.729
 victorious fight and then for vitalism 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.389
 freak years careers and why that's it 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.700
 but to be honest, it was already 37 38 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.770
 I went to be honest, I myself a little bit 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.660
 I will become a professional 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.229
 little I had thirty-eight fights at 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:04.780
 I am exactly in half 19 world championships 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:08.410
 spent and 16 years of occupation 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.160
 amateur boxing 384 i have a fight out 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.440
 which I 360 123 defeats 36 back I 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.680
 I grew up to be honest so though 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.810
 tired already need everything already but already 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.270
 something new to prove or to start it 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.370
 it would be probably in vain so ok i 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.410
 you did your job in amateurs 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.930
 say defeated shane module this 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.630
 module and in America at the Goodwill Games 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.970
 in the semi final on his points in big 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.530
 advantage for i will go out cleanly if 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.320
 ask the americans in america you 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.240
 you win then it is natural if 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.880
 I would have won in an equal fight 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.620
 to see him well just the opinion prevails 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.419
 that you can never lose in 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:52.660
 lovers like here have such a leg 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:57.280
 1990 is a game of goodwill in seattle 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.130
