plaque I'm almost done with my run it's
gonna<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> 15<00:00:21.930> miles<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.590> I've<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:24.170> three

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
gonna be a 15 miles and I've got three

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.259 
gonna be a 15 miles and I've got three
quarters<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.710> mile<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.670> steep<00:00:27.000> hill

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
quarters of a mile a really steep hill

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.890 
quarters of a mile a really steep hill
up<00:00:28.230> between<00:00:29.130> me<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> car<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.720> exhausted

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
up between me and the car I'm exhausted

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.220 
up between me and the car I'm exhausted
I<00:00:31.500> likes<00:00:31.769> her<00:00:31.890> shot<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.870> noticing

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I likes her shot and I was just noticing

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.100 
I likes her shot and I was just noticing
that<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> started<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> hill<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
that as I started going up the hill I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
that as I started going up the hill I
gear<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> bicycle<00:00:38.600> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
gear down just like on a bicycle it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.889 
gear down just like on a bicycle it
takes<00:00:39.840> smaller<00:00:40.260> steps<00:00:41.660> steeper<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> hill

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
takes smaller steps steeper the hill

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.639 
takes smaller steps steeper the hill
gets<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.770> smaller<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.489> steps<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.000> take<00:00:45.649> just

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
gets the smaller the steps I take just

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.840 
gets the smaller the steps I take just
like<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> life<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> hardest<00:00:48.780> days<00:00:49.610> are<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
like in life the hardest days are the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.389 
like in life the hardest days are the
days<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.210> take<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> smallest<00:00:51.809> steps

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
days that you take the smallest steps

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.350 
days that you take the smallest steps
when<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.520> feeling<00:00:53.699> great<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.239> you're

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
when you're feeling great when you're

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.490 
when you're feeling great when you're
feeling<00:00:54.510> powerful<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.350> feeling

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
feeling powerful when you're feeling

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.709 
feeling powerful when you're feeling
strong<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.219> life<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> nice<00:00:57.360> smooth

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
strong when life is a nice smooth

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
strong when life is a nice smooth
downhill<00:00:58.230> yeah<00:00:58.530> take<00:00:59.039> those<00:00:59.219> big<00:00:59.430> strides

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
downhill yeah take those big strides

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.689 
downhill yeah take those big strides
stride<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:01.020> open<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.530> feel<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.250> speed

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
stride it out open up feel the speed

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.240 
stride it out open up feel the speed
feel<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> wind<00:01:03.239> hitting<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.750> face<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:05.129> when

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
feel the wind hitting your face but when

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
feel the wind hitting your face but when
you<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.580> uphill<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.390> steep<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
you going uphill and it's steep and it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.330 
you going uphill and it's steep and it
seems<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.560> never<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.890> reach<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
seems like you're never gonna reach the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
seems like you're never gonna reach the
top<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.790> life<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.780> bigger<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.409> can

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
top and life is just bigger than you can

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.520 
top and life is just bigger than you can
manage<00:01:10.790> take<00:01:11.790> smaller<00:01:12.600> steps<00:01:13.640> gear<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:15.530> put

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
manage take smaller steps gear down put

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
manage take smaller steps gear down put
your<00:01:16.560> head<00:01:16.799> down<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.400> focus<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
your head down and just focus on the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
your head down and just focus on the
next<00:01:18.810> three<00:01:19.170> inches<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> front<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
next three inches in front of you and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
next three inches in front of you and
three<00:01:21.240> inches<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> time<00:01:21.810> you'll<00:01:22.290> make<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> up

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
three inches at a time you'll make it up

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.730 
three inches at a time you'll make it up
that<00:01:22.830> hill<00:01:23.450> taking<00:01:24.450> three<00:01:24.750> inch<00:01:24.900> steps<00:01:25.229> uphill

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that hill taking three inch steps uphill

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.330 
that hill taking three inch steps uphill
is<00:01:26.000> no<00:01:27.000> harder<00:01:27.450> than<00:01:28.140> taking<00:01:28.320> three<00:01:28.799> footsteps

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is no harder than taking three footsteps

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.359 
is no harder than taking three footsteps
on<00:01:29.610> flat<00:01:29.939> ground<00:01:30.530> we<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.159> hills

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
on flat ground we just think that hills

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
on flat ground we just think that hills
are<00:01:32.549> harder<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:32.939> we're<00:01:33.210> trying<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.049> keep

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
are harder because we're trying to keep

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.249 
are harder because we're trying to keep
the<00:01:34.439> same<00:01:34.680> speed<00:01:35.240> life<00:01:36.240> throws<00:01:36.509> obstacles<00:01:37.079> at

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the same speed life throws obstacles at

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
the same speed life throws obstacles at
us<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> instead<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.130> gearing<00:01:38.490> down<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
us and instead of gearing down and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
us and instead of gearing down and
slowing<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.930> try<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> keep<00:01:40.439> moving<00:01:40.650> at

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
slowing down we try to keep moving at

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.149 
slowing down we try to keep moving at
the<00:01:40.979> same<00:01:41.159> speed<00:01:41.610> our<00:01:42.200> expectations<00:01:43.200> move<00:01:44.009> at

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the same speed our expectations move at

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
the same speed our expectations move at
the<00:01:44.250> same<00:01:44.460> speed<00:01:44.850> our<00:01:45.030> commitments<00:01:45.720> move<00:01:46.259> at

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the same speed our commitments move at

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.219 
the same speed our commitments move at
the<00:01:46.470> same<00:01:46.649> speed<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> can't<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the same speed but you can't do that in

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.120 
the same speed but you can't do that in
life<00:01:50.329> when<00:01:51.329> life<00:01:51.509> gets<00:01:51.689> hard<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> slow

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
life when life gets hard you got to slow

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
life when life gets hard you got to slow
down<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.240> change<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.049> speed<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.770> your

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
down you go change the speed of your

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.100 
down you go change the speed of your
commitment<00:01:56.280> some<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.909> goals<00:01:57.119> especially

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
commitment some of your goals especially

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
commitment some of your goals especially
if<00:01:58.500> your<00:01:58.619> expectations<00:01:59.280> which<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.969> shouldn't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
if your expectations which you shouldn't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.410 
if your expectations which you shouldn't
even<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.479> anyways<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> don't<00:02:02.939> give<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.119> up

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
even have anyways so don't give up up

even have anyways so don't give up up
