it's critical it's no different than
racing<00:00:13.059> if<00:00:13.270> you<00:00:13.510> have<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:14.020> have<00:00:14.139> it<00:00:14.260> for

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
racing if you have to have it for

racing if you have to have it for
further<00:00:14.830> quality<00:00:15.219> as<00:00:16.000> a<00:00:16.059> bird<00:00:16.299> mold<00:00:16.570> so<00:00:16.690> I<00:00:16.720> mean

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
further quality as a bird mold so I mean

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.240 
further quality as a bird mold so I mean
that's<00:00:16.930> what<00:00:17.439> it's<00:00:17.560> gonna<00:00:17.680> look<00:00:17.770> like<00:00:17.920> in<00:00:18.160> the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
that's what it's gonna look like in the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.130 
that's what it's gonna look like in the
pen<00:00:18.430> so<00:00:18.640> I<00:00:18.670> think<00:00:18.790> nutrition<00:00:19.750> and<00:00:19.869> health<00:00:20.020> are

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
pen so I think nutrition and health are

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.589 
pen so I think nutrition and health are
probably<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.439> most<00:00:20.590> important<00:00:21.040> things<00:00:21.220> for

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
probably the most important things for

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.330 
probably the most important things for
for<00:00:22.599> show<00:00:22.779> that's<00:00:23.680> important<00:00:23.980> keep<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.160> birds

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
for show that's important keep the birds

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.130 
for show that's important keep the birds
healthy<00:00:24.670> all<00:00:24.790> year<00:00:24.820> long<00:00:25.150> you<00:00:25.390> know<00:00:25.539> and<00:00:25.960> keep

were<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.300> three<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.840> energy<00:00:38.230> comes<00:00:38.470> in<00:00:38.620> when

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
were the three the energy comes in when

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.100 
were the three the energy comes in when
people<00:00:39.220> race<00:00:39.489> birth<00:00:39.850> they<00:00:40.540> need<00:00:40.780> something

mile healthy bird always performs better
you<00:00:49.479> know<00:00:49.540> it's<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.440> many<00:00:50.920> people<00:00:51.159> are<00:00:51.220> healthy

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
you know it's a many people are healthy

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.610 
you know it's a many people are healthy
it's<00:00:51.790> important<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:53.049> fertility<00:00:53.320> is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
it's important that the fertility is

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.049 
it's important that the fertility is
better<00:00:53.830> so<00:00:53.979> you<00:00:54.070> raise<00:00:54.220> more<00:00:54.460> birds<00:00:54.729> and<00:00:55.000> on

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
better so you raise more birds and on

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
better so you raise more birds and on
the<00:00:55.180> birds<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.629> more<00:00:55.750> productive<00:00:56.250> fancy<00:00:57.250> people

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the birds a more productive fancy people

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.180 
the birds a more productive fancy people
because<00:00:59.739> with<00:01:00.489> fancy<00:01:00.940> pigeons<00:01:01.119> they<00:01:01.510> breed

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
because with fancy pigeons they breed

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.180 
because with fancy pigeons they breed

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
our biggest problem so most of the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.250 
our biggest problem so most of the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
Spain they come from Poland so that's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.630 
Spain they come from Poland so that's
one<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.569> problems<00:03:16.079> we<00:03:16.319> have<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.610> have

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
one of the problems we have is you have

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.449 
one of the problems we have is you have
to<00:03:17.910> add<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.750> cost<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.440> bringing<00:03:19.980> them<00:03:20.250> in

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
to add the cost of bringing them in

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.699 
to add the cost of bringing them in
which<00:03:21.000> makes<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.450> products<00:03:21.840> much<00:03:22.049> expensive

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
which makes the products much expensive

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.069 
which makes the products much expensive
more<00:03:22.890> expensive<00:03:23.239> than<00:03:24.239> they<00:03:24.390> would<00:03:24.630> be<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:24.930> we

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
more expensive than they would be if we

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.950 
more expensive than they would be if we
were<00:03:25.170> able<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.470> buy<00:03:25.709> them
