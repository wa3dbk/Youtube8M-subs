parchment<00:02:20.290> paper<00:02:20.560> right<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.780> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
parchment paper right here take one of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.530 
parchment paper right here take one of
my<00:02:22.990> cutlets<00:02:23.730> lay<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> parchment<00:02:25.300> paper

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
my cutlets lay it on the parchment paper

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.380 
my cutlets lay it on the parchment paper
fold<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> other<00:02:26.620> side<00:02:26.920> over<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.820> then<00:02:28.240> I've

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
fold the other side over and then I've

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.390 
fold the other side over and then I've
got<00:02:28.570> my<00:02:28.600> mallet<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.590> I'm<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.220> going<00:02:30.370> to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
got my mallet and I'm just going to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.440 
got my mallet and I'm just going to
pound<00:02:30.670> these<00:02:30.910> out<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> trick<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.390> is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
pound these out so the trick to this is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.330 
pound these out so the trick to this is
not<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.140> overdo<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.590> these<00:02:35.860> are<00:02:35.980> actually

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
not to overdo it these are actually

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.130 
not to overdo it these are actually
quite<00:02:36.640> delicate<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.780> want<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.020> give

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
quite delicate so you just want to give

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.620 
quite delicate so you just want to give
it<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> few<00:02:38.739> good<00:02:38.770> snaps<00:02:39.310> absolutely<00:02:40.209> perfect

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
it a few good snaps absolutely perfect

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.710 
it a few good snaps absolutely perfect
okay<00:02:41.290> I'll<00:02:41.470> do<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.709> rest<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.070> these<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.720> then

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
okay I'll do the rest of these and then

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.960 
okay I'll do the rest of these and then
we<00:02:43.840> will<00:02:44.020> dredge<00:02:44.260> them<00:02:44.470> with<00:02:44.650> flour<00:02:44.860> all<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.820> do

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.540 
we will dredge them with flour all we do
with<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.540> basically<00:02:47.100> dredge<00:02:48.100> them<00:02:48.310> right

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
with this is basically dredge them right

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.720 
with this is basically dredge them right

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
in the flour like so and then you shake

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.370 
in the flour like so and then you shake
it<00:02:51.790> off<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.269> don't<00:02:52.360> want<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.720> excess<00:02:53.140> on

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380

there when you go to fry it and do this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.229 
there when you go to fry it and do this
with<00:02:57.100> all<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.580> rest<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.880> mine<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.910> make<00:03:01.060> these

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
with all the rest of mine to make these

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.420 
with all the rest of mine to make these
really<00:03:01.420> special<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.320> taking<00:03:02.860> some<00:03:03.070> fresh

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
sage right out of the garden and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.699

securing it with that big onto each

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.770 
securing it with that big onto each
medallion<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.640> cut<00:03:12.850> these<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.150> half<00:03:13.180> by<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.600> way

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
medallion I cut these in half by the way

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.229 
medallion I cut these in half by the way
I<00:03:13.810> decided<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.350> wanted<00:03:14.620> them<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.799> little<00:03:15.010> smaller

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
I decided I wanted them a little smaller

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.720 
I decided I wanted them a little smaller
so<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.299> took<00:03:16.390> each<00:03:16.750> little<00:03:17.230> fillet<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.340> cut<00:03:18.610> it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
so I took each little fillet and cut it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.789 
so I took each little fillet and cut it
in<00:03:18.850> half

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
in half

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.530 
in half
and<00:03:20.310> see<00:03:20.459> how<00:03:20.579> simple<00:03:20.819> that<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.420> these

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and see how simple that is and these

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.440 
and see how simple that is and these
will<00:03:21.689> fry<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.349> nicely<00:03:22.909> when<00:03:23.909> you<00:03:24.000> saute
