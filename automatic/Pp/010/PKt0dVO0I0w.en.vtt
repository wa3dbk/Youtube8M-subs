at<00:04:12.359> all<00:04:12.510> now<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.260> want<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.500> use<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.739> touch

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
at all now I want to use the touch

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.440 
at all now I want to use the touch
feature<00:04:14.250> that's<00:04:14.639> going<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.910> enable<00:04:15.180> your

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
feature that's going to enable your

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.250 
feature that's going to enable your
scratch<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.760> can<00:04:17.909> scratch<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.479> track<00:04:18.780> but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
scratch so you can scratch the track but

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.380 
scratch so you can scratch the track but
when<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.620> tap<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.519> top<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.150> going<00:04:21.330> to

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
when you tap the top it's going to

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.450 
when you tap the top it's going to
stutter<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.470> cue<00:04:22.650> point

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.250 

all<00:04:27.460> right<00:04:27.580> we<00:04:27.670> have<00:04:27.730> a<00:04:27.820> 3-band<00:04:28.390> EQ<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:28.870> each

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
all right we have a 3-band EQ on each

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.110 
all right we have a 3-band EQ on each
channel<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.280> allows<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.940> really

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
channel this allows you to really

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.000 
channel this allows you to really
fine-tune<00:04:31.570> your<00:04:31.900> music<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.530> your<00:04:32.740> mix

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
fine-tune your music and your mix

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.880 
fine-tune your music and your mix
depending<00:04:33.280> on<00:04:33.550> how<00:04:33.700> you<00:04:33.760> play<00:04:34.110> now<00:04:35.110> taking<00:04:35.710> the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
depending on how you play now taking the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.130 
depending on how you play now taking the
eq's<00:04:36.580> all<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:37.030> way<00:04:37.150> down<00:04:37.420> will<00:04:37.840> give<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.110> a

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
eq's all the way down will give you a

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.770 
eq's all the way down will give you a
complete<00:04:38.320> kill<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:39.310> your<00:04:39.700> low<00:04:39.910> high<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.450> mids

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
complete kill of your low high and mids

complete kill of your low high and mids
as<00:04:40.960> well<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.730> using<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.600> Loops<00:04:46.840> couldn't<00:04:47.260> be

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
as well so using the Loops couldn't be

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.560 
as well so using the Loops couldn't be
easier<00:04:47.710> all<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.250> have<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.670> do<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.210> hit<00:04:49.450> the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
easier all you have to do is hit the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.600 
easier all you have to do is hit the
loop<00:04:49.780> button<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.440> it's<00:04:50.740> going<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.950> glute<00:04:51.280> or

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
loop button and it's going to glute or

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.280 
loop button and it's going to glute or
whatever<00:04:51.970> predetermined<00:04:52.810> measure<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:53.170> you

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
whatever predetermined measure that you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.890 
whatever predetermined measure that you
have<00:04:53.500> within<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.890> settings<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:55.210> disable<00:04:55.810> it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
have within the settings to disable it

have within the settings to disable it
all<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.200> have<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.650> hit<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.950> loop<00:04:57.100> again

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
all you have to do is hit the loop again

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.940 
all you have to do is hit the loop again
now<00:04:58.330> when<00:04:58.540> you<00:04:58.630> hit<00:04:58.750> your<00:04:58.960> loop<00:04:59.170> your<00:04:59.710> waveform

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
now when you hit your loop your waveform

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.130 
now when you hit your loop your waveform
is<00:05:00.280> gonna<00:05:00.430> have<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.640> blue<00:05:01.060> color<00:05:01.600> right<00:05:01.870> around

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140

you when you disable it you're still
gonna<00:05:04.570> see<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.900> little<00:05:05.170> bit<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.440> that<00:05:05.650> so

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100

whenever you hit the really button you
know<00:05:07.960> exactly<00:05:08.470> where<00:05:08.860> your<00:05:09.010> previous<00:05:09.490> loop

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
know exactly where your previous loop

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.570 
know exactly where your previous loop
begins<00:05:09.970> or<00:05:10.450> ends<00:05:10.720> by<00:05:11.560> using<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.950> divide<00:05:12.280> and

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
begins or ends by using the divide and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
effects to choose from that can be used

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.790 
effects to choose from that can be used
on<00:05:24.310> deck<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.820> or<00:05:25.090> deck<00:05:25.330> B<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:26.140> have<00:05:26.260> your<00:05:26.380> filter

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
on deck a or deck B you have your filter

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.310 
on deck a or deck B you have your filter
your<00:05:27.220> flange<00:05:27.610> your<00:05:28.060> slice<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.750> your<00:05:28.960> delay

now these can be adjusted by using the

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.110 
now these can be adjusted by using the
time<00:05:31.960> rate<00:05:32.200> knob<00:05:32.440> on<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.710> front<00:05:32.890> or<00:05:33.580> also<00:05:33.820> the
