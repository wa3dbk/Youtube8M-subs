 there are very good youtube here I am 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.260
 commenting today I bring you a new 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.490
 revision of the weapon model a weapon that 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.349
 you are seeing me a lot since the 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.610
 disque touched me in the toast are seen 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.169
 of the bad in the past week that by 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.820
 true I have uploaded another episodes today and what 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.559
 you lost three and a half cat 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.519
 I think it was so good you have 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.960
 out there if you do not want to see is in the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.420
 description of how always and here 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.120
 we have a gameplay with the m1 put the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.860
 power pink at last power because then 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.300
 well I 'm looking to check the weapon 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.370
 it has a big pink ray 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.320
 funny but only that is a very lightning 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.730
 lethal especially on my pc have explained 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.140
 also because I think I 'm in with the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.880
 law but good explain and cheapening 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.710
 how this weapon works a little bit 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.329
 if you have not seen the other video and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.800
 well let's talk about 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.210
 this background model you have an empire 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.860
 This time domain for me are 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.360
 pulling in the second part of domain 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.610
 They're throwing me a record 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.230
 discreet in this plot of this house and 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.190
 just just actually kill the one 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.570
 will be at the bottom of the map with the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.130
 portillo with the paladin at the same time 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.630
 is in the air the paladin is left here 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.309
 a little inside killed one that I had left 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.750
 for the helicopter I take it out I throw it 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.130
 I also shot the drone and you will see that I 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.059
 begins to give cakes in the middle of 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.230
 map the truth is that it is a streak 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.790
 awesome here in the middle then 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.649
 even more than a while I was in the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.670
 corner and you'll see and well then what 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.110
 as regards to temple and it's pretty 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.520
 fun as always I like to leave you 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.500
 something then entertaining vital for 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.350
 from the bottom so that is the weapon not like that 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.579
 that we go with the weapon then we have to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.109
 right on the top right and the 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.090
 statistics of this weapon in turn what 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.520
 most important two points the damage is 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.860
 low good also goes up a point of the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.759
 mobility and low one management point a 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.679
 point of cadence and a point of 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.969
 precision you remember that the model m1 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.409
 the one that was of cadet race was also 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.850
 very good but this is a lot 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.340
 better yet simply for the damage 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.719
 then it loses precision which then 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.860
 makes the entity last my opinion will be 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.329
 essential and in this case I take it 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.979
 with a stock unsheathed to be a 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.240
 little more that I have more mobility though 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.880
 this gun to shoot career too 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 it's very beneficial, that's why the cylinder head does not 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.689
 it's a must-have mega but unattached 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.670
 in my opinion yes to aim from afar and 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.009
 the weapon the truth is that it goes very well or 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.569
 I'm going to give them weapon techniques like 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.520
 always 6 that I have statistics of all 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.229
 weapons modes and good the normal m1 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.299
 you have to do harm well all 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.530
 the m1 do damage by fps the fps are 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.209
 the frames to which the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 game either on console or I started in 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.979
 console are 60 and I started I think that as 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.539
 maximum are 144 then this weapon makes 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.030
 damage by fps with which each hit 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.319
 marquez is does the damage of the weapon 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.049
 then each end mark how much does 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.300
 well good about 5 forgiveness up close 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.610
 6 ago 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.700
 at a distance of 5 and far 4 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.500
 and well, this model does 6 up close 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.850
 6 am and at a distance and 5 thousand eyes with 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.350
 which greatly increases the damage 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.790
 to the original model and that's why you see that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.740
 deals a lot above all I say that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.630
 I started because I started with because 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.100
 I started even going more than double the fps 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.200
 I do not know how the issue of 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.640
 fps I started with this weapon to Ivan said 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.870
 that this girl is also with the mouse 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.420
 Well, as a hip shot I started 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.980
 much easier because it must be the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.150
 repudiate or here is a teacher moment 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.860
 people because time is following 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.110
 with the damn radio of this one of 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.550
 burn the solar tower and it would not let me in 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.080
 peace and the guy trying to give me all the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.940
 he gives me one from time to time and he does not 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.100
 I felt pretty funny between the gun and 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.960
 what's wrong with me, so that kid is 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.550
 the weapon is very good I have to tell you 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.930
 that the cadence in laser weapons does not 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.870
 lowers the speed from which the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.550
 hits markers but it decreases the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.960
 time in which over heating is to say 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.030
 if you shoot often with a laser weapon 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.350
 you know that it overheats then 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.790
 if they have the cadences and on cali 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.890
 it is faster and if it has more deficiency 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.140
 it overheats less quickly with what 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.550
 which is not as important as in other 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.840
 weapons and this weapon is also 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.850
 overheats then with enough 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.050
 difficulty so good is not a thing 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.670
 that we really care about the only thing that fucks 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.620
 it's a little accuracy but 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.300
 It is arranged with a handle and with a 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.410
 little skill when with her 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.450
 you ask for the roll 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.650
 so good up to here the review of 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.000
 this weapon that I say improves 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.080
 very much that we would be in primary 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.400
 because I'm really cool it's super 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.380
 fun the truth to play with her 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 besides that it is good and as I say 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.709
 I started telling me how it goes 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.390
 Some of you will have it in me 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.700
 consolidate that in any of the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.140
 consoles the game moves 60 frames 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.880
 per second with which the weapon still 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.290
 It's very good but of course I started 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.459
 moves more twice as this weapon 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.310
 it has to be a boy from the host not 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.260
 in my opinion so good this is all 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.180
 what awaits the weapon then good 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 I always say they make us nervous because 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.870
 Many of you ask me for models that I already have 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.069
 involved and that by not uploading all the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.959
 days what about the weapons models always 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.370
 I like to do two three a week the 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.220
 theme of the models is worth it for us 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.650
 raise a lot with the series and well 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.540
 do not worry if the weapon I have it 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.680
 so I'll upload some you also ask me 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.140
 many models of weapons that always 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.720
 I remember that you have already uploaded me 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.489
 for example you ask me the steel by me 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.900
 you ask for the guilt is always great in 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.600
 twitter of her you have me a lot of 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.220
 weapons that I have already uploaded then if 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.389
 you are interested in a weapon looking for 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.989
 playlist that I'm going to leave you 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.120
 above 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.190
 has right above forgiveness and also 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.000
 you have the description sincerely me 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.410
 I recommend it 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.750
 happen because there are a lot of models 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.130
 which are all very interesting 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.169
 you have the weapon of the arsenal you do not know and 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.509
 to erase the un and of cisco yo therefore look 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.830
 America has a review and I liked it very 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.210
 I'm sure I'll be able to 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.889
 program of games that you like 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.849
 about and that's why I always tell you that 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.009
 go through the playlist 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.080
 because many times you ask me for things and what 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.940
 I say honestly because it is that I wear 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.410
 to recommend without putting your metal and already 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.729
 I have climbed or climbed such and I do not have it 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.960
 so if I do not have the weapon, 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.150
 upload the review not when I touch what 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.710
 I will upload for example that I have already 5 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.909
 what involved and all that so 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.699
 You have to give me a little time 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.659
 to raise it the job and such because 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.610
 I also have a lot of weapons 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.800
 back earrings like the emily that I 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.940
 he also played last week and all that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.740
 so do not worry I have a 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.849
 lots of more outfits for you is 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.110
