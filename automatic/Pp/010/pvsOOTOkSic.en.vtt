00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780 
rocks I tried to make it so like there's
a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.110> caves<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.740> open<00:01:53.100> space<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
a lot of caves in open space on the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.719 
a lot of caves in open space on the
bottom<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> water<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.979> flow<00:01:56.100> through<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.700> that

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
bottom so water can flow through so that

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
bottom so water can flow through so that
detritus<00:01:57.360> doesn't<00:01:57.659> build<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> same

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
detritus doesn't build up on the same

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.800 
detritus doesn't build up on the same
bed<00:01:58.850> or<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> can't<00:02:00.180> really<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.659> because

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
bed or you can't really see it because

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.060 
bed or you can't really see it because
there's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> shadow<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> cave<00:02:02.040> over

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
there's a shadow but there's a cave over

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
there's a shadow but there's a cave over
that<00:02:03.079> connects<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.200> over<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:05.540> see<00:02:06.540> some

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that connects to over here see some

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.050 
that connects to over here see some
caves<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> hole<00:02:08.520> goes<00:02:08.759> out

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
caves over here then the hole goes out

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.259 
caves over here then the hole goes out
into<00:02:09.899> here

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.869 

into<00:02:14.269> back<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.830> got<00:02:15.860> another<00:02:16.220> cave<00:02:16.549> over

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
into back that you got another cave over

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.530 
into back that you got another cave over
there<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.459> mean<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.790> came<00:02:19.970> out<00:02:20.150> pretty<00:02:20.360> good

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
there so I mean it came out pretty good

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.990 
there so I mean it came out pretty good
I<00:02:20.989> kind<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.769> my<00:02:21.980> old<00:02:22.190> rock<00:02:22.430> work<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.849> little

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000

better<00:02:23.239> but<00:02:23.659> I<00:02:24.250> mean<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.459> what<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.790> if

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
better but I mean it is what it is if

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.789 
better but I mean it is what it is if
anybody's<00:02:26.510> ever<00:02:26.599> taking<00:02:27.049> that<00:02:27.140> tank<00:02:27.409> apart

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.339 
anybody's ever taking that tank apart
before<00:02:27.950> knows<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.790> once<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.930> move<00:02:30.140> those

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
before knows that once you move those

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.720 
before knows that once you move those
rocks<00:02:30.590> you'll<00:02:30.829> never<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.250> him<00:02:31.370> back<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.549> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
rocks you'll never get him back to the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.830 
rocks you'll never get him back to the
