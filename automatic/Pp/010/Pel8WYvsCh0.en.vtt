00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello 70 vagueness and this video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.390
 really particular and I wanted 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.189
 talk about five secret facts e 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.370
 quite terrifying for how much 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.110
 concerns disneyland or disney in general 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.560
 it's the first truly terrifying fact 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.359
 flight talk concerns 1974 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 will cover many of a young girl 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.580
 the beast on.le was only 18 years old 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.050
 and he was really working at disneyland 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 from very little they had parties of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 an attraction called americans 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 in these operations consisted of six 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.790
 rotating platforms the public 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 he could look directly at her 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.719
 armchair were six different shows on 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.370
 his pupil were therefore al 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.469
 end of show hard healthy 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 everyone is there or there is a problem with this 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.860
 platforms were many and nobody knows 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.850
 how good the dynamics went 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.739
 episode 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 no one has heard anything since everyone 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 they sang so there was quite a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.899
 big mess but at the banks of his age 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 but unfortunately betti muri remains in ca 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.590
 properly between two of these things is a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 wall tells quite terrifying 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.039
 that none of his colleagues even 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.230
 none of the public noticed anything 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 on youtube there are video bathrooms where you 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.019
 see the liquid- traction drug dealing too 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.570
 that there is 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.189
 the scream of davison really wasn't 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.330
 never recorded anything like that none 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.460
 he never noticed 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
 after this terrible attraction 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.509
 it was closed and some were installed 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.180
 lights in safety the fund checked on 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.369
 number 4 concerns abandoned parks 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.960
 I do n't know if you know how to do it there are several 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.939
 disneyland packages that are 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.680
 literally abandoned there are some 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.790
 video on youtube on some of these 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.740
 days that are not what they are 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.369
 particularly interesting said between 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.320
 we 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 one of these causes come 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 opened in 1994 and then closed 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.000
 in 2001 this is a water park 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 as the park of discover to the sides was 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.329
 an island concept in which it was made 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.939
 pretending to be explorers there 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.680
 of animals form line leaps in the margin 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.360
 affixed here too many sleepers la 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950
 Khedira official nail these brands 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.930
 why 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.969
 therefore it happened for economic reasons in 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.920
 where we gain nothing but how much 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.409
 someone else seems a different thesis 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.719
 some people say and argue that 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.659
 in the nearby park in the near year they were 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.490
 have been found in glen lorelli that a 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.140
 apparently they create a disease that is 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.100
 lethal of 90 percent of the cases 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.069
 in the human being 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.690
 it would seem that a child is 1980 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.400
 be sick of this very thing 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.590
 so many people assume that the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.150
 park was closed 21 years later 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.860
 for this reason the sinceratevi 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.510
 praised the v this thing wants so much in 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.489
 Libya saw that a dispute arose 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.410
 so many others should have died 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.420
 people limbo is one thing 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.880
 terrifying the record number or 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 good big mielec of ai apparently 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.959
 boldi was a close friend of the boss of 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.730
 whites cube as you know in that one 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.319
 certain period of Italians there is a little 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.569
 was a witch hunt of the 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.120
 communism in the cinema and many others 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.010
 people reported that people did 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.569
 he thought they could be near by 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.970
 boat in favor of communism 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.680
 you want won three of his animators that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.420
 exceeded during production of 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.130
 dumbo apparently disney let's say in 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.920
 trusted room will have to submit the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.750
 its white chlorine screenplays 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.180
 they checked that there was no one 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.310
 reference to socialism in there 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.019
 his screenplays and he had good laugh 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.519
 because I imagine there is also what can 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.180
 be a reference to socialism 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.670
 immediately in canese sub areas happen 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 of politics but apparently it can 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.930
 also mention in a certain period also 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.000
 of was accused is suspected we say of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.470
 to be on the Soviet side 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.209
 you probably need no action 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.069
 punitive against the dvd what it is instead 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.340
 been to other artists or hollywood 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.170
 but even this thing makes mystery and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.370
 integrity may not even exist 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.870
 literally simply being one 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.180
 corridor entry of the web 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.950
 because in reality the files of the fbi walt 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.049
 disney are still secreted and that 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.459
 claiming secrets means many 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.230
 things means there could be 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.880
 I might as well keep many 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.010
 to be nothing is simply because 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.790
 all your secrets are secret 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.340
 everything 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.680
 the terrifying secret number two is 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.040
 quite terrifying it seems in the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.959
 2000 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.000
 perfect for disney employees 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.739
 they block a woman who has a thing 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.390
 terrifying to want to throw 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.340
 traction within a traction 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.109
 is that of pirates of the Caribbean who 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.849
 sincerely personally lack of 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.040
 good a heel and terrorist really 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.900
 that woman was throwing ashes 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.269
 of a deceased within the traction 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.849
 and the thing means ntec and it is not the only one 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.500
 what is true from the 90s very many 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.299
 people go and throw their own 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.400
 ashes of owners within the 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.799
 parks disney the most quoted tracks 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.690
 are those in the background or the house of 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.669
 ghosts and the attraction of gods pirates 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.229
 caribbean who as you know in the states 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.580
 united so well to take after a few 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.160
 days that one of yours was cremated 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.639
 dear and spread the ashes where you want 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.099
 however this practice is so used of 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.990
 have so often that very often 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.490
 people of disney implicate must 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.639
 literally go with expropriations 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.560
 real giants to suck all the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.759
 dust the ashes of these from sources 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.800
 inside the parts where yes 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.810
 accumulate in these attractions because 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.940
 obviously the coar inspire them is not one 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.919
 great thing so imagine how many 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.530
 people are thrown out there we are at 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.760
 terrifying fact number one concerns 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.860
 a documentary that was even 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.419
 awarded with the Oscar or Arctic 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.680
 wild in English is called 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.000
 white folders wahlberg nas to this evil 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.979
 what a documentary should be 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.440
 scientific lunge u chun be 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.210
 something real is rumored that reality 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.710
 there is a scene within this 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.500
 documentary that was concocted 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.169
 it is literally terrifying it is aimed at 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.180
 who is the least of the animals that much 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.210
 you've probably seen the video game 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.250
 of the ming on the singh business foods there 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.080
 mini are practically a half species 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.580
 of cross t as you see at that time 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.470
 the documentary had to be 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.690
 scientific and wanted to carry on but 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.180
 he believes that is what i am higgs yes 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.780
 they commit suicide in mass when they are missing 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.699
 resources 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.710
 but we are on a documentary 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.810
 then to resume this suicide in 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.550
 the lemmings needed to be 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.289
 lucky enough to be at 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.479
 right place and above all in one place 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.159
 where there was no resources according to which 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.449
 this where it is not even true not 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.879
 it seems to be effective 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.159
 this mass suicide however in this 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.069
 precise case if it claims that in reality 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.020
 the enix were taken up while yes 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.909
 they committed suicide but in reality they were 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.309
 killed kids support that they came 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.139
 literally thrown and thrown for 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.669
 to be able to resume their suicide 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.319
 that in reality they were simply gods 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.569
 twenties throw him in fact die 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.370
 in the water, in short, if you don't try, leave 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.990
 the credit has invested many 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.669
 people say it's not true that yes 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.400
 They commit suicide en masse in search of something else 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.960
 so by installment so I can't go into it 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.270
 in these territories you let me know 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.009
 these were five very secret secrets 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.839
 fold back to tell her that you win almost 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.879
 virtue but actually tried separately 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.830
 the first is the death unfortunately of 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.990
 lea beeston the rest are ready e 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.699
 heart of urban legends like 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.050
 since you never heard of them 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.999
 these things if you knew 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.499
 yes i like a video like this e 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.499
 see you at the next video
