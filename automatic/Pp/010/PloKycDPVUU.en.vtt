00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 they do 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.690
 the cooper 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.880
 mostly bad but today what you have about piet a16 because it 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.750
 Football season in the Netherlands is currently over and I thought that is one 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.210
 nice moment at the rabo main class 16 because I have a number of things 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 which I would really like to see in viva 6 4 it is too late considering that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 on this give first what I touched would look different at five 16 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.379
 pilots with this second position change pay attention so much at the moment 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.480
 Players here cannot use it on position while they do get there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.450
 I can play an example and watched the wrapping paper say outside 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.620
 work on it is not for the first time again on space 2 players 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.350
 and then for example you already have excesses from zeist 9 all in shape 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.550
 special card and and that and all other positions if there is already a lot of red card 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.650
 edo all not change so that is really a super a I still have a lot 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.900
 more examples of players who play at the position and that you don't have them 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.860
 another to a different position it does, as far as I'm concerned, just play so me 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.600
 I really hope that I could come up with something for that, for example 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.590
 For example, if a dump truck spout ears once every ten 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.910
 contests in the rush hour with him, so that he is also going to be too far 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.370
 play with a player in a special position that is in the course of the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.350
 get time at that position that would really seem like a super chill bah on the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.230
 announcement he felt that she should at least be so much more likely to do this 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.870
 just make sure to flow in on the pee 6 3 and on the pee getting 4 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.700
 because they are only there before I am and I think that was personally defeated 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.800
 Because it is on reading it you know and I would love to lose it 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 but that is not possible at the moment 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.010
 but I hope that I am that habran criticasters 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.040
 And of course you still have the price right now 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.170
 it is also his way to the job, I am sure it will not happen 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.230
 That's why I have another idea that people need for flexible short 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.200
 Rides The players just need to be able to determine the price of players 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.239
 that is perhaps possible with flexible architecture 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.269
 he will play it disagrees 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.829
 will know the price 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.509
 55 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.989
 and if it's maybe worth five years, velserbroek benefits recipients 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.569
 and 6 km 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.449
 that is where my job is now 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.339
 then you also can't buy as far as I'm concerned 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.339
 also can't sell because that's what we want 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.230
 and of course the viva must be lower because you are currently paying 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.099
 a 100 km road becomes blind 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.819
 euros 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.370
 that really makes no sense at all because you can 10 million cage traps boy 14 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.709
 euro free in a few days ten respondents exotics then you have to check 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.139
 who guitar for his first love the first duel viva fever you online 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.120
 can buy 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.850
 With this the ek can be organized because this is really not normal and I thought so 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.869
 this one also stays really super I don't think it will happen by year 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.359
 you never know and I want that I believe you but I would really mind that 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.229
 if you can make your own player from a simple tap, you have one 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.379
 example at the start of fivari are 75 account 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.529
 the man himself a bit the city everything a bit the same as career and through 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.859
 playing a lot with your own player can make your playing better 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.680
 if you follow a lot of good place in the competition and give the easter falls 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.599
 already a few nice goals, but I am going to be fired and you can 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.930
 by playing a lot maybe playing makes it a good player 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.790
 about fifty clothes sold will both teams chose got the holes 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.039
 play even better 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.839
 I do not know if that seems like a nice idea now it will be better known in the 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:41.429
 reactions we would still have more possession of the ball and that led to another 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.639
 idea what you do although the case is great 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.399
 I know for sure he is 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:52.809
 the explosion and how if there is scored and the explosion come with them if you have one 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:53.859
 carrot 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.649
 we have to have an explosion in his home if you don't want to make it 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:59.799
 the stores are coming 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.859
 when you are nicely done 7 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.000
 to find out all explosion 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 we see here comes from sixteen with explosives 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.529
 refuse 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.139
 Almkerk the Polish television 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.069
 but I am also curious what you would like to see in 4 6 6 3 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.550
 a response later this week 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.550
 the police did a nice video while the Keukenhof 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.449
 I see you posted 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.789
 the hague i think we will get far 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:48.140
 lieberman as the pitaboys ran today i didn't know where we will see 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.880
 he is right from the region and trainees and a number of other sources
