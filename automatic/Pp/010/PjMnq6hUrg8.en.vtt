for any kind of other power source I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.000 
for any kind of other power source I
wanted<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> eliminate<00:00:47.760> gasoline<00:00:49.010> electricity

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

but also the look on boats airplanes so
it's<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.420> little<00:02:46.540> bit<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.840> everything<00:02:47.110> although

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it's a little bit of everything although

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.100 
it's a little bit of everything although
the<00:02:48.010> car<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.460> radically<00:02:48.940> different<00:02:48.970> from<00:02:49.480> any

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the car is radically different from any

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.110 
the car is radically different from any
production<00:02:50.500> car<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.980> think<00:02:51.610> from<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.820> form

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
production car I think from a form

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.450 
production car I think from a form
design<00:02:52.840> point<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.260> view<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:54.010> form<00:02:54.190> language

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
design point of view the form language

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.670 
design point of view the form language
is<00:02:54.550> actually<00:02:54.790> quite<00:02:55.000> sophisticated<00:02:55.690> quite

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
is actually quite sophisticated quite

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.340 
is actually quite sophisticated quite
Scandinavian<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.760> car<00:02:57.970> has<00:02:58.150> no<00:02:58.330> openings<00:02:58.540> no

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
Scandinavian this car has no openings no

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
Scandinavian this car has no openings no
legs<00:02:59.860> no<00:03:00.100> roof<00:03:00.640> no<00:03:00.880> doors<00:03:01.360> no<00:03:01.750> trunk<00:03:02.709> nothing

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.750 
legs no roof no doors no trunk nothing
it's<00:03:04.030> just<00:03:04.180> an<00:03:04.630> inner<00:03:04.830> shell<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:06.100> core<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
it's just an inner shell a core the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.090 
it's just an inner shell a core the
houses<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.209> people<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.780> provides<00:03:08.500> also<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
houses the people and provides also the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.490 
houses the people and provides also the
structure<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.970> surrounds<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.720> air<00:03:11.080> tank

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
structure that surrounds the air tank

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.990 
structure that surrounds the air tank
and<00:03:11.680> it's<00:03:12.010> completely<00:03:12.610> made<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.880> carbon<00:03:13.150> fiber

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
and it's completely made of carbon fiber

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.750 
and it's completely made of carbon fiber
and<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> top<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.080> bottom<00:03:16.290> shell

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and you have a top and bottom shell

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.580 
and you have a top and bottom shell
basically<00:03:17.760> clam<00:03:18.300> shell<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.960> inner

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
basically clam shell that inner

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.850 
basically clam shell that inner
structure<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:20.910> actually<00:03:21.270> quite

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
structure and so it's actually quite

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.119 
structure and so it's actually quite
basic

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
basic

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.490 
basic
architecture<00:03:25.030> we've<00:03:25.299> also<00:03:25.629> eliminated

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
architecture we've also eliminated

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.940 
architecture we've also eliminated
everything<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.900> conventional<00:03:28.900> cars<00:03:29.110> has<00:03:29.680> in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
everything that conventional cars has in

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.220 
everything that conventional cars has in
terms<00:03:30.129> of<00:03:30.310> suspension<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.239> tire<00:03:31.450> setup<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
terms of suspension and tire setup the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.440 
terms of suspension and tire setup the
two<00:03:32.379> carbon<00:03:32.680> fiber<00:03:32.829> shells<00:03:33.099> actually<00:03:33.970> go<00:03:34.239> out

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
two carbon fiber shells actually go out

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.140 
two carbon fiber shells actually go out
to<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.959> wheels<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.040> those<00:03:36.250> are<00:03:36.489> actually

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
to the wheels and so those are actually

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.630 
to the wheels and so those are actually
the<00:03:37.659> units<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.200> create<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:39.099> suspension

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
the units that create the suspension

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.699 
the units that create the suspension
from<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.329> design<00:03:40.599> perspective<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:41.440> believe

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
from a design perspective we believe

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.589 
from a design perspective we believe
that<00:03:41.829> beauty<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.430> function<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.269> work<00:03:43.450> in

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
that beauty and function can work in

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.110 
that beauty and function can work in
harmony<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.069> motion<00:03:45.489> concept<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.090> a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
harmony and the a motion concept is a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.409 
harmony and the a motion concept is a
perfect<00:03:46.659> example<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:47.230> this
