 once we have the saddle 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.290
 we double click left 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.549
 the file did 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.549
 the image is mounted 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 and we open the folder to see the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.390
 records 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.430
 we will leave this that this is the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.610
 application then if we open the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.750
 application now will ask us for a key what 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.810
 we want to limit this 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.320
 we give the crack folder very important 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.700
 have the unit mounted on the equipment 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.140
 As you can see when we open the file 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.370
 iso we double click left we 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.200
 ride as if we had a dvd 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.040
 it's important to have it assembled and we're going to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.709
 the crack folder 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.720
 and those from where it puts application we give 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.810
 double left click 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.850
 and we put it because I already have then 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.910
 will appear this applied the water crack 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.120
 grams applies water craft is already done 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.330
 and the move is here to create then 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.170
 it is not that we have put apli black 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.700
 water craft we close this we go the 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.380
 honey that we have assembled and 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.380
 obligatorily to play this game 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.970
 we just have to assemble the unit with 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.790
 we always have sweets if we can here 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.950
 for example expel and we do not have the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.320
 game and we assembled it from the beginning 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.820
 with the file did you need to put 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.350
 every time we mount a yacht the crack 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.880
 so here we give the one who is 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.880
 application and play can not be done 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.350
 so we do we do this right click 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.950
 direct character and it will tell us that here 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.740
 you can and we get it on the desk 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.990
 here we have it important to have the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.360
 mounted unit to play if not 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.360
 will work and that is all is to give 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.580
 we execute it and we can configure what 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.580
 what is the resolution and the graph 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.180
 we give play we play and that's all
