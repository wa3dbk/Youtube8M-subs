00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.420
 these are the ingredients for the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.200
 acid heart 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.460
 500 grams of fresh cheese beaten a 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 about tea with lemon soluble 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.550
 six sheets of neutral gelatin and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 red coloring we will start by hydrating 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.800
 the gelatin sheets for this what 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's do is cut each sheet 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.730
 in pieces 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.930
 and when we have them all cut 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.890
 we will cover 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.380
 with 3 or 4 tablespoons of cold water and 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.710
 we leave about 4 minutes until they are 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:49.220
 swollen and soft these sheets are already 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.650
 hydrated you can see they are soft 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.860
 Now what we will do is this jelly 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.800
 with the water to heat it in the microwave 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.980
 in a saucepan until the gelatin 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.720
 undo completely and the liquid that 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.620
 let's be completely transparent 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.390
 and without scales we put the gelatin in a 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.390
 bol we add the tea 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.330
 Red colorant 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.799
 and the beaten cheese 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 finally we mix well as well as me 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.440
 you have lumps do not hesitate to use a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.600
 rod blender or a blender 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.290
 normal or electric to get a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.659
 cream completely smooth and soft so 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.240
 we only have to distribute our mixture 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.069
 in one or two molds in this case I'm going 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.380
 to use some silicone molds in 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.500
 heart shape and we only have left 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.289
 Take our molds for 4 or 5 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.840
 at least the refrigerator for 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.709
 that the gelatin set and the dessert is 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.869
 ready to take at the time of serving 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.539
 we will heat a little water and 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.579
 We will put the mold a few seconds inside 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.250
 of the hot water so that we find 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.069
 easier to mold and do not lose 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.379
 pretty heart shape of the dessert and 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.899
 here you have it this is all that 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.870
 you need to make a rich heart 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.140
 acid with picapica flavor I hope that what 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.140
 you try
