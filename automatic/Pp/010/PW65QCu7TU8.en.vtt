quick<00:00:04.830> easy<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.759> efficient<00:00:06.270> tree<00:00:06.480> farm<00:00:06.750> now

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
quick easy and efficient tree farm now

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.700 
quick easy and efficient tree farm now
we<00:00:07.589> have<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.719> four<00:00:09.719> corners<00:00:10.080> area<00:00:10.230> each<00:00:10.410> corner

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
we have a four corners area each corner

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.220 
we have a four corners area each corner
is<00:00:10.800> sixteen<00:00:11.340> blocks<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.969> 16<00:00:12.389> blocks<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.019> then

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
is sixteen blocks so 16 blocks and then

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230 
is sixteen blocks so 16 blocks and then
it<00:00:13.349> comes<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.769> three<00:00:14.099> comes<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.730> three<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
it comes in three comes in three and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.109 
it comes in three comes in three and
around<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.230> square<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> all<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.880> here

will<00:00:33.630> fall<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> four<00:00:34.380> hoppers<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.640> let's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
will fall into the four hoppers so let's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.220 
will fall into the four hoppers so let's
say<00:00:36.030> you're<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.480> bit<00:00:36.570> farther<00:00:36.750> along<00:00:36.960> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
say you're a little bit farther along in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
say you're a little bit farther along in
your<00:00:37.320> survivor<00:00:37.680> world<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.430> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> make

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
this a little bit easier on yourself you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.319 
this a little bit easier on yourself you
can<00:00:40.739> add<00:00:40.860> yourself<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.399> line<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> hoppers<00:00:42.149> here

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
can add yourself a line of hoppers here

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
can add yourself a line of hoppers here
feeding<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.170> chest<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.489> there

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
want to have yourself true to tree farms

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.100 
want to have yourself true to tree farms
you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.239> both<00:00:51.329> feeding<00:00:51.719> into<00:00:51.930> one

today's tutorial on a super easy quick
and<00:00:56.640> efficient<00:00:57.059> tree<00:00:57.239> farm<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and efficient tree farm now if you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
and efficient tree farm now if you
wanted<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> duplicate<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> tree<00:00:59.730> farm<00:01:00.030> again

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
wanted to duplicate this tree farm again

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
wanted to duplicate this tree farm again
you<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> add<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.469> next<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you just have to add one right next to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
you just have to add one right next to
it<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> add<00:01:02.489> hoppers<00:01:02.940> lining<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.420> both<00:01:03.600> sides

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it and add hoppers lining on both sides

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
it and add hoppers lining on both sides
aiming<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.040> chest

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
aiming to one chest

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
aiming to one chest
now<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.270> beaky<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
now that beaky that can be can kind of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.890 
now that beaky that can be can kind of
expensive<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.549> about<00:01:08.760> 15<00:01:09.330> hoppers<00:01:09.750> on

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
expensive so it's about 15 hoppers on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.630 
expensive so it's about 15 hoppers on
each<00:01:10.049> side<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.590> order<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> meet<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.340> chest

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
each side in order to meet to one chest

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
each side in order to meet to one chest
now<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> eliminate<00:01:14.130> those

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
now I can we can we can eliminate those

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.600 
now I can we can we can eliminate those
hoppers<00:01:14.790> completely<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:16.229> by<00:01:16.439> doing<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
hoppers completely just by doing this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.090 
hoppers completely just by doing this
over<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.180> I'll<00:01:18.330> show<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.540> now

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.580 
alright guys so we're back over here at
the<00:01:22.320> two<00:01:22.770> tree<00:01:23.189> farms<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:23.759> now<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.439> did

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the two tree farms here now all we did

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
the two tree farms here now all we did
is<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.830> took<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.369> hoppers<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.060> center

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
is we took out the hoppers in the center

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.929 
is we took out the hoppers in the center
and<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.619> hollowed<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.790> added

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and we just hollowed it out and we added

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
and we just hollowed it out and we added
two<00:01:30.270> water<00:01:30.540> sources<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> bottom<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.560> so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
two water sources on the bottom there so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.270 
two water sources on the bottom there so
let's<00:01:31.829> jump<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.460> I'll<00:01:32.610> show<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:34.280> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
let's jump down there I'll show you and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.480 
let's jump down there I'll show you and
here<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.299> basically<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:37.920> out

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
here we go so basically there take out

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
here we go so basically there take out
the<00:01:38.549> hoppers<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> items<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.630> fall<00:01:39.840> down

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the hoppers so the items will fall down

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
the hoppers so the items will fall down
into<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.439> stream<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.460> keep<00:01:41.670> flowing

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
into this stream here and keep flowing

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.850 
into this stream here and keep flowing
down<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.590> side<00:01:43.740> as

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
down here and the same for this side as

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
down here and the same for this side as
well<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.189> hoppers<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> items<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.450> flow

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
well no hoppers the items will just flow

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
well no hoppers the items will just flow
down<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> stream<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.100> block<00:01:47.369> this

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
down to the stream here and I block this

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
down to the stream here and I block this
off<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:48.030> quickly<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.659> show<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> how

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
off really quickly so I can show you how

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.630 
off really quickly so I can show you how
you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.310> one

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you can you can do this with just one

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
you can you can do this with just one
hopper<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> hop<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.840> hopper<00:01:52.170> here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
hopper so we have a hop one hopper here

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.399 
hopper so we have a hop one hopper here
a<00:01:52.380> sign<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.520> double<00:01:53.909> chest<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
a sign and a double chest and how you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
a sign and a double chest and how you
would<00:01:55.649> how<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> both<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
would how you would make this both of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
would how you would make this both of
these<00:01:57.479> stream<00:01:57.899> into<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.380> flow<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:59.070> you'd<00:01:59.250> add

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
these stream into one flow is you'd add

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.719 
these stream into one flow is you'd add
a<00:01:59.399> sign<00:01:59.729> here<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.750> sign<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.579> then<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
a sign here and a sign here and then you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.569 
a sign here and a sign here and then you
would<00:02:02.850> add<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.329> water<00:02:03.570> stream<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.579> then

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
would add one water stream here and then

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.459 
would add one water stream here and then
you<00:02:05.700> break<00:02:05.939> these<00:02:06.180> blocks<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.079> break

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
you break these blocks here and break

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.740 
you break these blocks here and break
them<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.220> there<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.450> items

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
them here and there you go so the items

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
them here and there you go so the items
will<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:09.959> flow<00:02:10.349> into<00:02:11.129> these<00:02:11.280> signs<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
will now flow into these signs here and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.710 
will now flow into these signs here and
into<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.599> stream<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.260> then<00:02:13.410> right

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
into this one stream here and then right

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.630 
into this one stream here and then right
dear<00:02:13.930> hopper<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.500> doesn't<00:02:15.190> there's<00:02:15.460> no

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
dear hopper you doesn't there's no

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.400 
dear hopper you doesn't there's no
limitations<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.750> any<00:02:16.960> tree<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
limitations you can do any tree in the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.400 
limitations you can do any tree in the
game<00:02:17.710> this<00:02:17.920> works<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.400> fine<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.230> yeah<00:02:20.230> so

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
to decay and all the saplings to fall

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.310 
to decay and all the saplings to fall
into<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.330> water<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.780> come<00:02:31.930> over<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.230> this
