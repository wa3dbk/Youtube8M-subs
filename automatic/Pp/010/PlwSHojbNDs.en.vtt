00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 why August ran like that you want 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.559
 to say that you are larba no longer reports 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 all my actions to someone 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.289
 put you in a bad mood 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.609
 what can I do what you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.109
 can do is tell me exactly what 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.490
 that there is between witches and you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 again with this kind starts with 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.609
 it's listening to everything I've got 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 today 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.699
 but on that one I'm afraid of having to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.769
 to set limits not to cross 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.179
 it's about my stuff I was checking 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.180
 witch in my city 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 boat understood then that's funny 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 because when I left the new 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.829
 orleans a hundred years ago 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 you were a little bastard their 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.350
 pitiful still trembling shots of 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.700
 whip that you afflicted those who wanted 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.100
 prevent to succeed and today 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.079

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.440

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.440
 orleans 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.059
 I would like to know how 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.059
 jealous 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.619

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.119

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.890
 a prison colony completely 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.150
 now we do not have to live anymore 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.380
 in the shadows like local rats 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.590
 know where they stand they close the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.090
 eyes 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 never flopped color the party beats 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.909
 always full of passages in the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.979
 region you want to stay in town a little 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.920

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 my family my rules 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.260
 if anyone ever breaks the rules 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.410

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.660

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.700
