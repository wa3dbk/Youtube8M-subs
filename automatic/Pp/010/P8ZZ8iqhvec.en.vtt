00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
time on the track now here's the deal

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.420 
time on the track now here's the deal
the<00:02:26.660> first<00:02:26.840> three<00:02:27.170> inches<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.859> left<00:02:28.099> are<00:02:28.370> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the first three inches on the left are a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.250 
the first three inches on the left are a
harder<00:02:28.880> compound<00:02:29.090> than<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.630> nine<00:02:29.810> inches<00:02:30.109> on

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
harder compound than the nine inches on

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.839 
harder compound than the nine inches on
the<00:02:30.349> right<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.069> for<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.280> first<00:02:31.459> time<00:02:31.670> ever

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
the right so for the first time ever

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.089 
the right so for the first time ever
it's<00:02:32.090> two<00:02:32.269> compounds<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.709> should<00:02:33.950> tell

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
it's two compounds in one we should tell

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.159 
it's two compounds in one we should tell
you<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.489> nine<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.910> right<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.810> exact

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.169 
you that the nine on the right the exact

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.050 
you that the nine on the right the exact
same<00:02:36.410> compound<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.069> was<00:02:37.220> run<00:02:37.459> here<00:02:37.730> last

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
same compound that was run here last

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.390 
same compound that was run here last
year<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:39.709> really<00:02:39.829> surprised<00:02:40.190> me<00:02:40.220> because

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
year but it really surprised me because

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.699 
year but it really surprised me because
I<00:02:40.609> think<00:02:40.669> the<00:02:40.970> second<00:02:41.750> guy<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:41.930> always<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.530> such

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
I think the second guy is always in such

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.490 
I think the second guy is always in such
a<00:02:42.739> disadvantage<00:02:43.160> here<00:02:43.639> because<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.060> so

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
a disadvantage here because it's so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.100 
a disadvantage here because it's so
it's<00:02:44.650> being<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.920> tires<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.780> first<00:02:46.780> time<00:02:46.960> you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
it's being the tires that first time you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.180 
it's being the tires that first time you
go<00:02:47.260> off<00:02:47.380> into<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> corner<00:02:47.800> you've<00:02:48.070> been
