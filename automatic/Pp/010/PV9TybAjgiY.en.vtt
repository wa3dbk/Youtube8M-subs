works your airplane okay the left stick
is<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.490> rudder<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.060> your<00:00:18.810> nose<00:00:19.080> gear<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
is your rudder and your nose gear to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.099 
is your rudder and your nose gear to
steer<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:20.420> left<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:22.760> left<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> right

steer with left and right left and right
the<00:00:25.109> same<00:00:25.350> stick<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.949> also<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.519> throttle

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.460 

up<00:00:31.760> and<00:00:32.000> down<00:00:32.920> okay<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.910> rice<00:00:35.120> thick<00:00:35.450> is<00:00:36.110> the

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
left aileron right aileron up elevator

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.530 
left aileron right aileron up elevator
and<00:00:41.290> down<00:00:42.290> elevator<00:00:42.970> now<00:00:43.970> when<00:00:44.060> you<00:00:44.120> take<00:00:44.330> off

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
and down elevator now when you take off

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.410 
and down elevator now when you take off
it's<00:00:45.410> really<00:00:45.739> really<00:00:45.950> important<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:47.239> you

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's really really important that you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.690 
it's really really important that you
just<00:00:47.600> pull<00:00:48.500> straight<00:00:48.530> back<00:00:49.100> on<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.400> elevator

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
just pull straight back on the elevator

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.090 
just pull straight back on the elevator
you<00:00:50.570> don't<00:00:50.780> want<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.050> pull<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:51.710> direction

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
you don't want to pull it this direction

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.119 
you don't want to pull it this direction
or<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.030> direction<00:00:53.600> if<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.440> take<00:00:54.680> off<00:00:54.950> and

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
or that direction if you take off and

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.280 
or that direction if you take off and
you<00:00:55.309> pull<00:00:55.520> it<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.760> way<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.989> will<00:00:57.110> have<00:00:57.230> a

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
you pull it this way you will have a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.049 
you pull it this way you will have a
less<00:00:57.530> crash<00:00:57.830> your<00:00:58.129> plane<00:00:58.370> will<00:00:58.550> go<00:00:58.670> into<00:00:58.879> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
less crash your plane will go into the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.000 
less crash your plane will go into the
left<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.540> really<00:00:59.930> really<00:01:00.379> really<00:01:00.650> need<00:01:00.800> to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
left you really really really need to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.750 
left you really really really need to
learn<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:02.000> pull<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.210> stick<00:01:02.570> straight<00:01:03.370> down<00:01:04.370> and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
learn to pull a stick straight down and

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.810 
learn to pull a stick straight down and
up<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.659> left<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.710> right<00:01:06.920> until<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.430> get<00:01:07.640> good

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
up and left and right until you get good

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.390 
up and left and right until you get good
then<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.210> can<00:01:08.240> manipulate<00:01:08.720> them<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.530> work

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
then you can manipulate them and work

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.399 
then you can manipulate them and work
them<00:01:10.580> all<00:01:10.700> how<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:10.970> want<00:01:11.300> but<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.840> suggest

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
them all how you want but I suggest

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.260 
them all how you want but I suggest
until<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.830> learn<00:01:12.980> to<00:01:13.250> move<00:01:13.490> them<00:01:13.610> straight

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
until you learn to move them straight

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.310 
until you learn to move them straight
left<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.840> straight<00:01:15.800> right<00:01:16.130> like<00:01:16.370> this<00:01:17.320> this

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
left and straight right like this this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.260 
left and straight right like this this
makes<00:01:18.620> this<00:01:18.740> aileron<00:01:19.220> go<00:01:19.430> up<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.760> pushes<00:01:20.120> the

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
makes this aileron go up and pushes the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.930 
makes this aileron go up and pushes the
wing<00:01:20.450> down<00:01:20.659> making<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> plane<00:01:21.890> go<00:01:22.040> left<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
wing down making the plane go left and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.180 
wing down making the plane go left and
you<00:01:23.060> do<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.360> right<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.870> makes<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.500> aileron<00:01:25.010> go

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
you do it right it makes this aileron go

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.890 
you do it right it makes this aileron go
down<00:01:25.400> pushing<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.000> wing<00:01:26.180> down<00:01:26.420> make<00:01:26.750> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
down pushing the wing down make the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800 
down pushing the wing down make the
plane<00:01:27.080> go<00:01:27.110> right<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:29.240> makes<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.570> plane<00:01:29.780> go

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
plane go right this makes the plane go

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.920 
plane go right this makes the plane go
left<00:01:30.170> an<00:01:30.320> error<00:01:30.500> also<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.460> rye<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.240> steers<00:01:32.780> on

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
left an error also and rye and steers on

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.360 
left an error also and rye and steers on
the<00:01:33.020> ground<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:33.409> mostly<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.070> beginning

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
the ground but mostly in the beginning

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.650 
the ground but mostly in the beginning
you're<00:01:34.490> going<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.700> want<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.940> use<00:01:35.120> this<00:01:35.360> for

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
you're going to want to use this for

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.810 
you're going to want to use this for
steering<00:01:36.290> on<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.620> ground<00:01:36.920> if<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.370> over<00:01:37.790> a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
steering on the ground if you over a

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.790 
steering on the ground if you over a
rudder<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.450> air<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.960> can<00:01:39.110> also<00:01:39.260> cause<00:01:39.590> an

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
rudder in air you can also cause an

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.060 
rudder in air you can also cause an
accident<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:41.540> we<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:41.980> throttle<00:01:45.070> brother
