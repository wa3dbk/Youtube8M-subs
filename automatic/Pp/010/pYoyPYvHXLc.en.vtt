have product buildup which is going to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.260 
have product buildup which is going to
make<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.070> hair<00:01:38.220> look<00:01:38.250> very<00:01:38.549> greasy<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.119> oily

make your hair look very greasy and oily
which<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.900> good<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> always<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:41.100> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
which is not good so I always use this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
which is not good so I always use this
once<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.850> week<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> strip<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.530> hair

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
products and you can use this once or
twice<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.020> three<00:01:46.200> times<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.500> week<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.920> use

strip all the natural oils hero and that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280 
strip all the natural oils hero and that
