00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
rectangle shape at the bottom and then

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
rectangle shape at the bottom and then
after<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> you're<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> roll

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
shape at the bottom ok so then after

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.160 
shape at the bottom ok so then after
that<00:01:38.580> you're<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.570> whatever<00:01:39.780> color

going to just stick it on there and I'm
going<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.200> blend<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.980> little<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.460> step

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
going to blend it in a little I'm a step

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.560 
going to blend it in a little I'm a step
right<00:02:11.820> there<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.330> too<00:02:13.850> small<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> want<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
right there was too small so I want to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.820 
right there was too small so I want to
make<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> little<00:02:15.930> bit<00:02:16.140> long<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.590> just

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
make a little bit long and then just

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.090 
make a little bit long and then just
start<00:02:20.160> um<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.840> started<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> shaping<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.680> so

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
start um I just started to shaping it so

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.580 
start um I just started to shaping it so
if<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> look<00:02:23.430> better

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
