00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 Tell me guys, here's a test of the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.110
 my table to calculate dps here 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.779
 I'm with my bike ranter demon. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.439
 soft of the blush in case it 's beauty is here 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.170
 no character specifications this is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.460
 it has this beauty here is what 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 It matters to us here in case the damage 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.260
 dps is beauty 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.829
 I'll show you how to use the table. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.829
 I got the table here 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 so the first thing she asks here 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 the minimum owner of the minimum weapon is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:03.260
 so it's good to at least give a 35 53 55 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 the maximum damage is and 1.181 put it there 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 355 thousand 181 or 181 beauty ring the one cap 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:25.619
 he adds from 6 to 12 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:28.530
 I put 6 to 12 that the two neo gives nothing 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.560
 so I put nothing there moleto 6 to 12 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.520
 also offended if the java will not 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.079
 add no damage speed attack of 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 Good Aymara holiday, okay. 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:50.340
 here I have a bow and bow by 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.299
 standard it has 1.40 attacks per second 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 this one has besides this damage decided 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.259
 forgiveness beyond this attack speed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 the base has the speed increase of 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.250
 attack at 11 percent 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.289
 So that's how we do it. 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.489
 stop here 1.41 increase of 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.620
 11% 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.239
 Do you have any additional items? 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 and adds attack speed 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.700
 I have to see what I see here I do not 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.810
 I have in bed on the glove, I do not have it either. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:33.840
 this one increases 6 percent of 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:39.930
 times themes to what not to java then 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:46.140
 plus 15% fifteen percent with 6% 21% of 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.690
 21% chance of critical opa gesture 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.239
 I work here a little bit already. 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 you can see right there 100% with 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.459
 I'm sure I'm using the one that says 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.599
 the liability that increases the chances of 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:07.500
 critical then 100% critical damage 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:10.879
 additional 158% then with 958 attribute 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:19.470
 main is dexterity in my case then 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:23.630
 2026 increase in damage by the assis 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.630
 that the 35% 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.700
 so here I have it on my calculator 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.220
 the value 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.609
 one hundred nine thousand four hundred and 39.89 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:42.299
 see us with how much I am 109 thousand 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:46.049
 four hundred and forty and 8.60 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:51.480
 so we can already see that it had 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:54.530
 a difference here right 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.569
 Do you realize that there is not a big 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.160
 difference but there was a difference because 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.859
 is that there was this difference 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.859
 this difference is due to the fact that 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:11.459
 my weapon has this here 27% damage and 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:15.629
 if 27% of damage to an increase of the master 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.690
 gun but realize you that 27% can generate 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.510
 a broken value this broken value 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.789
 my gun is not shown yet 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.620
 so I can not know the exact value 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.480
 to do the calculation 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270
 as I can not do 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.150
 all I have left is to calculate with 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.300
 the information I can have 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.550
 and that's how I decided to do it then I 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.910
 I took the values ​​I actually have 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.620
 to keep this calculator 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.150
 let's experiment in a way 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.090
 different and let's put something together 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.420
 here to see if in fact the values ​​beat 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.070
 Let's do the following then as long as 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.670
 such disable the times that I am 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.070
 Some exchanged skills here I'll take all 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.180
 these lefts I will put only any 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:16.640
 skills here that do not increase my 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:16.640
 damage that here is okay 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.410
 beauty now the ps has already fallen a lot 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.120
 taking 0% the damage 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.120
 now we will see there in the table 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:49.319
 if I put zero and here the chance of 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.319
 critical was to 5% 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.039
 Look, look, a difference ends up being 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.499
 totally insignificant and it is with 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.189
 certainty caused by these values 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:05.110
 broken right 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:07.449
 so I'm sure that it will 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.150
 help many people in time for a 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:13.449
 negotiation there at the auction house because 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.060
 now you have how to know yes it really is 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.159
 with a game not showing you now 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.560
 out of work alone but you 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.389
 can find out the item that 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.460
 you will buy right 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.819
 really will be worth going to increase 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.020
 even cdps or not 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.120
 Unfortunately I was only able to make a 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.539
 account has only been able to 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.990
 for gps no, no, I do not know how to do it 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.310
 from defense 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.909
 but thats it sure will help 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.909
 you
