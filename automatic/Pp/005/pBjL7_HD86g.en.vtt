today and he got good utility out of it
with<00:00:38.160> zero<00:00:38.670> obviously<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.510> not

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
with zero obviously I know it's not

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
with zero obviously I know it's not
gonna<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.930> quite<00:00:40.200> as<00:00:40.350> potent<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.040> ax<00:00:41.070> but

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
gonna be quite as potent with my ax but

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.889 
gonna be quite as potent with my ax but
we're<00:00:41.790> still<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.030> try<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.510> it's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
we're still gonna try it out it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.720 
we're still gonna try it out it's
probably<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.320> gonna<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.710> great<00:00:44.430> synergy

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
probably not gonna have great synergy

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
probably not gonna have great synergy
with<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.960> chain<00:00:46.379> reaction<00:00:46.500> because<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
with a chain reaction because the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
with a chain reaction because the
bullets<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> hit<00:00:48.960> heads<00:00:49.230> or

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
bullets kind of need to hit heads or

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
bullets kind of need to hit heads or
criticals<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.309> well<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.449> say<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
criticals to do well but as I say that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
criticals to do well but as I say that
it<00:00:52.020> ended<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.410> killing<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.829> rat<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.309> was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it ended up killing that rat that was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.819 
it ended up killing that rat that was
underneath<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.239> maybe<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.350> better<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
underneath so maybe it has better you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.200 
underneath so maybe it has better you
know<00:00:55.949> chance<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.520> damage<00:00:56.699> than<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.059> thought

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
know chance to do damage than I thought

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
know chance to do damage than I thought
it<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.350> does<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> fairly<00:00:59.039> low

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it would it does have a fairly low

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.099 
it would it does have a fairly low
number<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> pellets<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.480> actually<00:01:00.690> need

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
number of pellets so we'll actually need

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.369 
number of pellets so we'll actually need
to<00:01:01.579> aim<00:01:02.579> make<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.510> our<00:01:03.780> pellets

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to aim make sure we get our pellets

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.710 
to aim make sure we get our pellets
actually<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.920> target<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:06.390> won't<00:01:06.570> just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
actually on target because we won't just

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.010 
actually on target because we won't just
be<00:01:06.840> getting<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.229> fabulous<00:01:07.470> amount<00:01:07.979> of

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
be getting a fabulous amount of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.780 
be getting a fabulous amount of
reflections<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.100> high<00:01:11.280> projectile

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
reflections because of a high projectile

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.859 
reflections because of a high projectile
count<00:01:13.790> all<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.060> we've<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> couple<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
count all right so we've got a couple of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.039

it's<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:32.020> especially<00:02:32.950> special<00:02:33.190> with<00:02:33.580> this

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
it's not especially special with this

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.850 
it's not especially special with this
build<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.209> anything<00:02:34.390> however<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.680> high

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
build or anything however it is a high

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.890 
build or anything however it is a high
tier<00:02:36.070> shotgun<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.000> does<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.360> lot<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.660> damage

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
tier shotgun and it does a lot of damage

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.470 
tier shotgun and it does a lot of damage
so<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.459> it's<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.209> may<00:02:40.420> be
