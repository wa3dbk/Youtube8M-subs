00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
butterfly flaps mount to inside of the

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.000 
butterfly flaps mount to inside of the
in<00:02:21.870> Dustin<00:02:22.319> control<00:02:22.769> unit<00:02:24.620> all<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:25.799> I'm

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
in Dustin control unit all right I'm

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.369 
in Dustin control unit all right I'm
gonna<00:02:26.099> turn<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.579> one<00:02:26.760> over<00:02:26.900> I'll<00:02:27.900> turn<00:02:28.170> one

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
gonna turn this one over I'll turn one

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.289 
gonna turn this one over I'll turn one
over<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.799> one<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.219> them<00:02:29.340> won't<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.609> turned<00:02:29.909> so

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
over and one of them won't be turned so

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.179 
over and one of them won't be turned so
it<00:02:30.599> gives<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:31.439> of<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.620> indication<00:02:31.920> what

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
it gives you more of an indication what

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.270 
it gives you more of an indication what
it<00:02:32.280> looks<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.810> um<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.439> my<00:02:34.560> fling<00:02:34.980> with

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it looks like um one of my fling with

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.610 
it looks like um one of my fling with
the<00:02:35.519> oven<00:02:36.060> cleaner<00:02:36.269> than<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.720> did<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.730> anywho

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the oven cleaner than I did so anywho

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.729 
the oven cleaner than I did so anywho
these<00:02:40.620> are<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.889> little<00:02:41.040> plastic<00:02:41.489> pieces<00:02:42.739> that

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
these are the little plastic pieces that

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.530 
these are the little plastic pieces that
fits<00:02:44.430> down<00:02:44.639> in<00:02:44.849> here<00:02:46.579> for<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:50.239> big<00:02:51.239> butterfly

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
fits down in here for the big butterfly

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.009 
fits down in here for the big butterfly
flaps<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.730> basically<00:02:53.730> my<00:02:54.239> opinion<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.989> don't

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
flaps so basically my opinion I don't

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.409 
flaps so basically my opinion I don't
know<00:02:55.409> how<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.919> works<00:02:56.159> but<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.700> think<00:02:57.329> the

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
know how it works but I think the

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.360 
know how it works but I think the
butterfly<00:02:57.930> flaps<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.859> like<00:02:59.129> a<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:02.340> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
butterfly flaps and more like a like a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.699 
butterfly flaps and more like a like a
extra<00:03:02.930> turbo<00:03:03.930> boost<00:03:04.310> when<00:03:05.310> they<00:03:05.430> open<00:03:05.760> up<00:03:06.709> so

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
extra turbo boost when they open up so

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.500 
extra turbo boost when they open up so
he's<00:03:08.129> got<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.430> clean<00:03:08.760> too<00:03:09.030> because<00:03:09.329> they're

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
he's got to be clean too because they're

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.379 
he's got to be clean too because they're
nasty<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.799> increasing<00:03:11.760> now<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:11.909> gotta<00:03:12.239> clean

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
nasty and increasing now I gotta clean

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.360 
nasty and increasing now I gotta clean
them<00:03:12.629> up<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.290> do<00:03:13.409> not<00:03:13.530> put<00:03:13.799> out<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:14.069> clean<00:03:14.220> all

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
them up but do not put out and clean all

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.159 
them up but do not put out and clean all
in<00:03:14.459> plastic<00:03:15.950> because<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:16.980> will<00:03:17.159> eat<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:18.169> you

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
in plastic because it will eat it you

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.899 
in plastic because it will eat it you

this shaft turn it has a gear on it turn

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.530 
this shaft turn it has a gear on it turn
and<00:03:52.440> open<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.859> those<00:03:53.069> valves<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:54.120> that's<00:03:54.329> more

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and open up those valves so that's more

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.990 
and open up those valves so that's more

Arian when you get fifty four hundred
rpms<00:03:58.069> it's<00:03:59.069> kind<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.340> like<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.729> that's<00:03:59.909> once

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
it's kind of like a turbo boost and I've

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.899 
it's kind of like a turbo boost and I've
read<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.139> towing<00:04:04.439> it<00:04:05.599> right<00:04:06.599> into<00:04:07.579> about<00:04:08.579> that

here's your seals for each one of the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.990 
here's your seals for each one of the
chambers<00:04:14.939> in<00:04:15.289> this<00:04:16.289> unit<00:04:16.709> here<00:04:17.099> in<00:04:17.459> this<00:04:17.609> part

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.729 
chambers in this unit here in this part
it's<00:04:18.659> three<00:04:18.870> parts<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.470> induction

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
it's three parts to the induction

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.629 
it's three parts to the induction
control<00:04:22.099> and<00:04:23.120> well<00:04:24.120> maybe<00:04:24.419> two

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
control and well maybe two

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.589 
control and well maybe two
it's<00:04:25.819> not<00:04:25.969> listed<00:04:26.180> on<00:04:26.449> there<00:04:26.689> is<00:04:27.020> three<00:04:27.620> anyway

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
it's not listed on there is three anyway

it's not listed on there is three anyway
but<00:04:29.599> uh<00:04:31.569> there's<00:04:32.569> some<00:04:32.750> valves<00:04:33.110> here<00:04:33.319> you<00:04:33.469> can

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
but uh there's some valves here you can

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.230 
but uh there's some valves here you can
see<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.770> little<00:04:34.039> holes<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.460> there<00:04:34.669> that's

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
see the little holes in there that's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.839 
see the little holes in there that's
what<00:04:35.419> your<00:04:35.539> seals<00:04:35.810> go<00:04:36.110> here<00:04:36.620> they<00:04:37.310> go<00:04:37.490> in<00:04:37.639> there

here's the shaft has these little

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.510 
here's the shaft has these little
