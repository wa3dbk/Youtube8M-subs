 gaming bold announcement of new maternal 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.510
 cards and we are on the chipset intel z77 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.980
 shortly before the appearance of the processor world 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.960
 fourth-generation intel core 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.360

 life cycle platform lga 1155 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.560
 it's too early to tell by the name 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.029
 device is easy to guess which 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.040
 it was the model that served as the basis for 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.100
 You do not have a new solution to this effect . 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.220
 no regrets initial mss z77 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.690
 hey dj 65 often took our place 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.860
 test benches and in general 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.810
 established itself as stable 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 unpretentious decision with good 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.680
 overclocking potential external 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.370
 the scenery is able to cool transform 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.530
 the device picked up the z77 hey DJ di 65 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.630
 gaming feeling of deja vu 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.190
 only fleeting though general layout 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.530

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.780
 can activate either program in 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.669
 quantum center application either by clicking 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.069
 corresponding button in the magnifier itself 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:13.289
 after the afterburner base clock 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.090
 CPU frequency increased to 4200 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.620

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.880
 and the memory worked steadily at 2200 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.729
 megahertz whole these are typical indicators 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.909
 for a good model on intel z77 work 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:43.289
 systems under air cooling 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:45.210
 updated modification of the popular board 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:46.229
 changing visually turned 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.000
 killer network controller 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.860
 allows you to get the minimum 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.330
 delays in games for the rest of it 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.270
 quality proven model on 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.270
