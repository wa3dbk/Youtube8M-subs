from<00:00:15.389> an<00:00:15.540> anterior<00:00:16.020> point<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.980> view<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.779> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
from an anterior point of view and you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.820 
from an anterior point of view and you
can<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:20.550> two<00:00:20.850> lateral<00:00:21.840> ventricles<00:00:22.590> and

can see the two lateral ventricles and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.720 
can see the two lateral ventricles and
the<00:00:23.990> third<00:00:24.990> ventricle<00:00:25.289> which<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.609> the
