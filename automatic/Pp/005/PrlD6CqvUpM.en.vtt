the enemy players I have to let them get

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
the enemy players I have to let them get
25<00:00:43.020> kills<00:00:43.440> before<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:43.980> allowed<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.520> any

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
25 kills before I'm allowed to get any

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
25 kills before I'm allowed to get any
kills<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> game<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
kills in the game and this is going to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
kills in the game and this is going to
be<00:00:47.250> pretty<00:00:47.820> challenging<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.390> think<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:49.410> good

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
be pretty challenging I think for good

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
be pretty challenging I think for good
for<00:00:49.860> ya<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.280> ghosts<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.789> did<00:00:51.030> four<00:00:51.660> kills

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
for ya for ghosts I did four kills

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
for ya for ghosts I did four kills
because<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.010> goes<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.640> 18<00:00:54.120> kills<00:00:54.360> for

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
because that only goes to 18 kills for

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
because that only goes to 18 kills for
gun<00:00:54.690> game<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.770> black<00:00:56.250> ops<00:00:56.430> 2<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> goes<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
gun game but for black ops 2 it goes to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
gun game but for black ops 2 it goes to
20<00:00:57.480> kills<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.410> actually<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.550> one

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
20 kills and I actually think this one

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.569 
20 kills and I actually think this one
may<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.300> easier<00:01:00.899> than<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.680> ghosts<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.430> not

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
may be easier than in ghosts but I'm not

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979 
may be easier than in ghosts but I'm not
too<00:01:02.730> sure<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.120> let's<00:01:03.270> hop<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> game<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
too sure so let's hop into a game and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.000 
too sure so let's hop into a game and
i'll<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.199> guys<00:01:04.320> once<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
though for gun game they're just so
crazy<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.170> every<00:01:37.590> time<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> spawn<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> just

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
crazy like every time you spawn you just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.840 
crazy like every time you spawn you just
got<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.759> ready

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.630 

come<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.780> let<00:01:42.900> me<00:01:42.930> finish<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.350> kill<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> needed

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
come on let me finish my kill I needed

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.780 
come on let me finish my kill I needed
one<00:01:44.850> more<00:01:44.880> bullet<00:01:45.240> into<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.689> guy<00:01:46.790> especially

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
one more bullet into that guy especially

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.190 
one more bullet into that guy especially
right<00:01:48.119> over<00:01:48.330> here<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> spawns<00:01:48.900> are<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.080> little

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
right over here the spawns are a little

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.540 
right over here the spawns are a little
crazy<00:01:49.670> there<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.850> go

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.660 

I<00:01:56.640> thought<00:01:57.510> maybe<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.900> could<00:01:58.220> steal<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.430> kill

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I thought maybe I could steal that kill

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670 
I thought maybe I could steal that kill
from<00:02:00.000> him<00:02:00.180> because<00:02:00.600> he<00:02:00.870> had<00:02:00.900> damaged<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.470> guy

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
from him because he had damaged that guy

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
from him because he had damaged that guy
so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> knew<00:02:02.130> he<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.370> way<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.120> my<00:02:03.240> normal

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
so I knew he was way out of my normal

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
so I knew he was way out of my normal
range<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.560> thought<00:02:05.070> maybe<00:02:05.310> I'd<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.610> able<00:02:05.760> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
range but I thought maybe I'd be able to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
range but I thought maybe I'd be able to
whose<00:02:06.210> guys<00:02:06.390> gonna<00:02:06.510> turn<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:06.840> me<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.470> turn

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
whose guys gonna turn on me don't turn

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.900 
whose guys gonna turn on me don't turn
on<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:10.100> hmm<00:02:12.260> what<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.500> missed<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.490> was<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
on me hmm what I missed I was just a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.620 
on me hmm what I missed I was just a
little<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.270> left<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.810> guy<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:20.630> really

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
little to the left on that guy I really

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.850 
little to the left on that guy I really
think<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:21.900> first<00:02:22.050> shot<00:02:22.290> should<00:02:22.440> have<00:02:22.560> hit<00:02:22.680> but

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
think my first shot should have hit but

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.340 
think my first shot should have hit but
that's<00:02:23.070> black<00:02:23.280> ops<00:02:23.490> 2<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.930> many<00:02:25.050> times

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that's black ops 2 for you so many times

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.990 
that's black ops 2 for you so many times
you<00:02:25.440> think<00:02:25.710> there's<00:02:26.160> no<00:02:26.400> way<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.850> could

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you think there's no way that you could

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.970 
you think there's no way that you could
possibly<00:02:27.030> miss<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.500> there<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.860> go

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
possibly miss it but you do there we go

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.730 
possibly miss it but you do there we go
