on<00:00:49.050> grant<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.129> better<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
on grant has to do better in the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310 
on grant has to do better in the
backfield<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:51.719> look<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
backfield you also look at they have to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.930 
backfield you also look at they have to
develop<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.710> backup<00:00:53.100> running<00:00:53.250> back<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.699> grant

16 already so it's going to be a tough
matchup<00:03:02.160> for<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.460> Eagles<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.570> a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
matchup for the Eagles but this is a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.970 
matchup for the Eagles but this is a
game<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.960> want<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.320> watch<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.800> going<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
be a lot of offensive hours because i

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.940 
be a lot of offensive hours because i
think<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> packers<00:03:07.110> defense<00:03:07.410> will<00:03:07.620> still
