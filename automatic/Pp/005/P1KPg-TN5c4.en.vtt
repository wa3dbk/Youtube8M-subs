now three cups water for me is the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.550 
now three cups water for me is the
perfect<00:02:04.710> ratio<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.670> water<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> almonds<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.350> if

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
perfect ratio of water to almonds but if

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
perfect ratio of water to almonds but if
you<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.920> thinner<00:02:08.160> milk<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.000> can

for a sweet application you know you
could<00:02:37.830> also<00:02:38.040> use<00:02:38.430> almond<00:02:38.880> milk<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.450> base

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
could also use almond milk as the base

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.800 
could also use almond milk as the base
for<00:02:39.739> example<00:02:40.739> for<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> creamy<00:02:41.760> butter<00:02:42.180> nuts<00:02:42.480> -

but I'm gonna use mine for sweet

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.630 
but I'm gonna use mine for sweet
applications<00:02:46.260> such<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:46.500> smooth<00:02:46.950> smoothies

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
applications such as smooth smoothies

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.220

now you can do this either before you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.830 
now you can do this either before you
strain<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.670> through<00:03:23.970> your<00:03:24.090> sprout<00:03:24.329> bag<00:03:24.570> or

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
strain it through your sprout bag or

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.000 
strain it through your sprout bag or
after<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.329> I'm<00:03:27.600> gonna<00:03:27.750> add<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.410> vanilla

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
bean and since I'm adding this before we

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.500 
bean and since I'm adding this before we
strain<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.400> I'm<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.790> gonna<00:03:33.000> go<00:03:33.209> ahead<00:03:33.329> and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
strain it I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.729

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
bean in the blender there you go that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.490 
bean in the blender there you go that
was<00:03:43.769> easy<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.780> you're<00:03:45.900> gonna<00:03:46.019> add<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
vanilla bean after you strain it through

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.970 
vanilla bean after you strain it through
your<00:03:48.570> sprout<00:03:48.840> bag<00:03:49.019> you're<00:03:49.560> gonna<00:03:49.680> want<00:03:49.950> to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
your sprout bag you're gonna want to

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.890 
your sprout bag you're gonna want to
open<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.430> vanilla<00:03:50.730> bean<00:03:50.940> up<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.420> scoop<00:03:51.750> out
