literally pick through it and find the
best<00:02:14.890> piece<00:02:15.250> big<00:02:15.519> hunks<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.940> meat<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.510> make

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.000 
sure you add as much other gravy as you
can<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> meat<00:02:20.440> does<00:02:20.620> dry<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
can because the meat does dry out a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.420 
can because the meat does dry out a
little<00:02:21.190> bit<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.739> basically<00:02:23.739> smash<00:02:24.160> that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
little bit and just basically smash that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.570 
little bit and just basically smash that
in<00:02:24.610> there<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:27.010> shred<00:02:27.430> it

basically<00:02:27.970> shred<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.420> beef<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:28.930> you're<00:02:29.650> just

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
basically shred it beef so you're just

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.800 
basically shred it beef so you're just
mixing<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.549> like<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.480> said<00:02:31.660> make

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
mixing it with that like I said make

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.020 
mixing it with that like I said make
sure<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.080> add<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.260> gravy<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:35.850> next<00:02:36.850> all

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
fry them enough to where they're soft

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.110 
fry them enough to where they're soft

and pliable not too on soft but you know
pliable<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:36.020> this<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.530> actually<00:03:36.950> what<00:03:37.220> they

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
pliable and this is actually what they

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.700 
pliable and this is actually what they
look<00:03:37.550> like<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.960> reason<00:03:39.200> why<00:03:39.350> they're<00:03:39.560> in

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
look like the reason why they're in

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.620 
look like the reason why they're in
little<00:03:41.020> stacks<00:03:42.020> is<00:03:42.260> because<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.590> do<00:03:42.740> it<00:03:43.040> by

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
little stacks is because I do it by

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.820 
little stacks is because I do it by
layers<00:03:44.630> how<00:03:44.990> many<00:03:45.140> layers<00:03:45.290> I'm<00:03:45.530> going<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.710> make

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
layers how many layers I'm going to make

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.500 
layers how many layers I'm going to make
so<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.520> next<00:03:46.730> thing<00:03:46.850> you're<00:03:46.940> gonna<00:03:47.000> do<00:03:47.270> is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
so the next thing you're gonna do is

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.710 
so the next thing you're gonna do is
warm<00:03:47.930> up<00:03:48.140> your<00:03:48.500> in<00:03:48.800> gelato<00:03:49.190> sauce<00:03:49.550> in<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.330> pot

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
warm up your in gelato sauce in a pot

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:15.580 
warm up your in gelato sauce in a pot
and<00:03:53.720> then<00:03:53.900> we're<00:03:54.110> ready<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.470> assemble

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.650 

so<00:04:16.590> now's<00:04:16.769> time<00:04:16.889> does<00:04:17.280> symbol<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.030> enchiladas

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
so now's time does symbol the enchiladas

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.770 
so now's time does symbol the enchiladas
so<00:04:19.410> much<00:04:19.530> you're<00:04:19.650> going<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.919> do<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.750> take<00:04:21.750> some

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
so much you're going to do is take some

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.360 
so much you're going to do is take some
sauce<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.260> put<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.949> bottom<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.310> your

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
sauce and put it in the bottom of your

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.659 
sauce and put it in the bottom of your
pan<00:04:23.669> because<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.060> actually<00:04:24.240> helps<00:04:24.930> prevent<00:04:25.669> it

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
pan because it actually helps prevent it

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.350 
pan because it actually helps prevent it
from<00:04:26.699> sticking<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:29.280> just<00:04:29.760> add<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> little<00:04:30.210> bit

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
from sticking so I just add a little bit

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.900 
from sticking so I just add a little bit
of<00:04:30.389> sauce<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.870> bottom<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.199> pan<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.159 

next<00:04:35.910> what<00:04:36.060> I'm<00:04:36.150> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.330> do<00:04:36.510> is<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:37.080> going

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
next what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.129 
next what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:04:37.229> actually<00:04:37.620> take<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.539> corn<00:04:39.539> tortillas<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
to actually take the corn tortillas and

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.070 
to actually take the corn tortillas and
dunk<00:04:40.350> them<00:04:40.440> in<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.650> sauce<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.810> start<00:04:42.810> to

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
dunk them in the sauce and start to

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.909 
dunk them in the sauce and start to
layer<00:04:43.400> build<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> layers<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:47.490> goes<00:04:48.919> bottom

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
layer build the layers so it goes bottom

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.330 
you know the quantity is so cut the Jews
the<00:05:57.120> sauce<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.720> all<00:05:57.810> that<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.230> make<00:05:58.980> sure<00:05:59.010> you

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
the sauce and all that so make sure you

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.300

add enough sauce bake in the oven for
about<00:06:02.580> 15-20<00:06:03.360> minutes<00:06:03.930> at<00:06:04.050> 100<00:06:04.440> degrees<00:06:05.750> so

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
about 15-20 minutes at 100 degrees so

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.030 
about 15-20 minutes at 100 degrees so
this<00:06:06.870> is<00:06:07.050> what<00:06:07.200> it<00:06:07.290> looks<00:06:07.440> like<00:06:07.530> when<00:06:07.770> you<00:06:07.860> pull
