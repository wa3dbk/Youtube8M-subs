and<00:02:08.009> over<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.459> should<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.910> see

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and over here you should actually see

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.400 
and over here you should actually see
that<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.600> reading<00:02:10.190> more<00:02:11.190> memory<00:02:12.200> how<00:02:13.200> cool

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that it's reading more memory how cool

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.730 
that it's reading more memory how cool
is<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
is that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.140 
is that
again<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> can't<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> cuz<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.850> virtual

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
again I can't do it cuz it's a virtual

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.270 
again I can't do it cuz it's a virtual
machine<00:02:15.270> now<00:02:15.810> Windows<00:02:16.140> 7<00:02:16.500> actually<00:02:16.920> sees<00:02:17.130> all

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
machine now Windows 7 actually sees all

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.500 
machine now Windows 7 actually sees all
your<00:02:17.430> RAM<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.910> don't<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.360> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
your RAM so you don't have to do this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.880 
your RAM so you don't have to do this
but<00:02:18.810> here's<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.050> thing<00:02:19.080> some<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
but here's the thing some of the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890 
but here's the thing some of the
applications<00:02:20.520> they<00:02:20.819> only<00:02:21.000> set<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.630> see

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
applications they only set to see

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.360 
applications they only set to see
certain<00:02:22.140> amount<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.350> memory<00:02:22.470> also<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.130> have<00:02:23.280> an

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
certain amount of memory also I have an

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.160 
certain amount of memory also I have an
application<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.750> gonna<00:02:24.840> try<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
application for that we're gonna try it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.870 
application for that we're gonna try it

has lah support now here's the thing I
did<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.300> Windows<00:03:04.110> 7<00:03:04.470> with<00:03:05.220> Pro<00:03:05.400> Tools<00:03:05.430> and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
did this Windows 7 with Pro Tools and

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.670 
did this Windows 7 with Pro Tools and
pro<00:03:06.480> tool<00:03:06.660> automatically<00:03:07.170> comes<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.530> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
pro tool automatically comes with this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.960 
pro tool automatically comes with this
so<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:07.950> don't<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> patch<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.700> up<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:08.880> you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
so you don't have to patch it up if you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.240 
so you don't have to patch it up if you
using<00:03:09.300> Pro<00:03:09.720> Tuesday<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.560> 7<00:03:10.830> point<00:03:11.040> 4

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
using Pro Tuesday when I have 7 point 4

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.550 
using Pro Tuesday when I have 7 point 4
had<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.269> patching<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.410> worked

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
had to do the patching and it worked

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560 
had to do the patching and it worked
perfectly<00:03:13.980> fine<00:03:14.220> actually<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.940> saw<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.239> little
