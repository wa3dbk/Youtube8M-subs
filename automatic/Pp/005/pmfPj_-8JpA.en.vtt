00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
and this person was asking me because

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.310 
and this person was asking me because
they've<00:00:24.210> been<00:00:24.420> looking<00:00:24.780> through<00:00:25.050> different

raw food recipe books and websites and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410 
raw food recipe books and websites and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that has peanuts in it and so they're

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.020 
that has peanuts in it and so they're

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
buy them majority of them are either

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.529 
buy them majority of them are either
roasted<00:01:01.979> or<00:01:02.159> fried<00:01:02.269> okay

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
roasted or fried okay

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
roasted or fried okay
they<00:01:04.080> don't<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.350> sell<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.250> raw<00:01:05.670> peanuts

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
they don't really sell much raw peanuts

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.560 
they don't really sell much raw peanuts
around<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.920> easy<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.340> find<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
around it's it's not as easy to find you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.470 
around it's it's not as easy to find you
can't<00:01:10.020> find<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.620> and<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:11.640> had<00:01:11.940> raw<00:01:12.210> peanuts

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
can't find it and I've had raw peanuts

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.600 
can't find it and I've had raw peanuts
before<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.410> don't<00:01:13.590> taste<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
before and they don't taste all that

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
before and they don't taste all that
good<00:01:14.790> compared<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.690> having<00:01:15.900> them

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
good compared to actually having them

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.550 
good compared to actually having them
roasted<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.760> there's<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:19.290> much

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
roasted so that there's just not as much

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.680 
roasted so that there's just not as much
of<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.800> demand<00:01:19.980> there's<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.970> demand<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.420> raw

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
of a demand there's a demand for raw

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.720 
of a demand there's a demand for raw
peanuts<00:01:21.960> usually<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:23.040> people<00:01:23.370> that<00:01:23.550> are

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
peanuts usually from people that are

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.120 
peanuts usually from people that are
gonna<00:01:23.940> roast<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:24.660> or<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.320> cook<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:25.860> up

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gonna roast them or or cook them up

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.120 
gonna roast them or or cook them up
themselves<00:01:26.340> okay<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> first

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
themselves okay so that's the first

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
themselves okay so that's the first
reason<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.000> they're<00:01:30.570> cooked<00:01:30.810> second

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
reason is is that they're cooked second

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
reason is is that they're cooked second
reason<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.250> most<00:01:32.400> important<00:01:32.850> reason<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
reason and the most important reason is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.980 
reason and the most important reason is
that<00:01:34.250> peanuts<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:36.120> contain<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> very

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that peanuts actually contain a very

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.370 
that peanuts actually contain a very
dangerous<00:01:37.290> mold<00:01:38.010> okay<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.660> it's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
dangerous mold okay and it's it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.430 
dangerous mold okay and it's it's
naturally<00:01:41.160> occurring<00:01:41.910> mold<00:01:42.720> okay<00:01:43.230> it's<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
naturally occurring mold okay it's a

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.840 
naturally occurring mold okay it's a
fungus<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.490> grows<00:01:45.500> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> actual<00:01:47.430> peanut

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fungus that grows on the actual peanut

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.260 
fungus that grows on the actual peanut
plant<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:50.159> mold<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> called<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> Fox

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
plant and this mold is called the Fox

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600 
plant and this mold is called the Fox
scent<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.080> pretty<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
scent and it's pretty much like the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
scent and it's pretty much like the
research<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.060> done<00:01:54.300> is<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.500> say<00:01:55.740> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
research have done is it they say that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.330 
research have done is it they say that
it's<00:01:56.100> about<00:01:56.220> 20<00:01:56.760> times<00:01:57.090> more<00:01:58.080> dangerous<00:01:59.010> than

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's about 20 times more dangerous than

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's about 20 times more dangerous than
DDT<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.510> we<00:02:00.659> all<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:00.990> DDT<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
DDT and we all know about DDT and the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.390 
DDT and we all know about DDT and the
effects<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.840> DDT<00:02:04.050> being<00:02:04.620> sprayed<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.159> all<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
effects of DDT being sprayed and all the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.070 
effects of DDT being sprayed and all the
neurological<00:02:06.330> problems<00:02:06.720> people<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.990> been

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
neurological problems people have been
