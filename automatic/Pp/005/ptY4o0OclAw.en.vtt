so<00:02:50.590> 99<00:02:50.920> 999<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.079> then<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.230> save<00:02:53.500> stars<00:02:53.890> it's

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
so 99 999 and then the save stars it's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.349 
so 99 999 and then the save stars it's
three<00:02:54.610> digits<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.870> 999<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:59.940> then<00:03:00.940> save<00:03:01.329> it
