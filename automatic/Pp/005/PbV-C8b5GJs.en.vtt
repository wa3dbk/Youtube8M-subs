00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.889
 so first of all hello today we are told you asking a lot of 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.800
 titles of two spades 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.949
 turn of spades 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.109
 so here I do not know much about the auction a little novice lacks 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.279
 caregivers of time 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.279
 the Portuguese who turns his back 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.470
 then to start with entity apart in extra time 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.119
 the aussie 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.279
 it is due Taiwanese medina 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.980
 e to cap horn rightly 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.630
 to pay 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.230
 when you do not see 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.910
 very deterrent as portable as the ideal for them this defense 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430
 it's the teachers 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 we know we will move to 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.320
 but that's the style 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.830
 cutting back the man arrived is saying it quickly 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.010
 so that m 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.270
 ingredients 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970
 near the seat is possible 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.760
 I can not take a big one, it's going to hurt 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 we know we'll have a little gem 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.440
 but his queries and 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.560
 hush hush 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.580
 and that's all 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 so as his name indicates 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 I do not know what it means better 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.430
 it's a knife it's perfect partly nor the parliament its doors and 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.400
 the height of jam happiness 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's good we did not care how it is 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.510
 so we know we'll have a small selection 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510
 a small section of toddlers 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.360
 it's the sum and darling 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.970
 because the unobtrusive portrait the man 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.120
 ideal gourmet little tricks traitor 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.130
 that's what 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 so for 100 m the man we had what shots on goal at 2 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.640
 so this maintenance that I have all the time on me the little micra 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.360
 I bought in a sports store with the appearance transparency of home 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 Decathlon I'm not a little bit more, but well, here's what 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 therefore we will move to the home model 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.860
 6 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 in theory we 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 nicky hayden at 6 pm then it's for angela 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.509
 mickaÃ«l youn said roy relatively light james moore 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.609
 for others it will be rather ample 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.909
 we would recognize it on my punch so and then to finish because 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.349
 to finish 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.029
 my little thing I did not do my time I'll leave a small post 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.679
 on the site 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.899
 so here or 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.949
 but Kalashnikov to follow heart of the clumsiness of the months to the following banks 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.659
 the advice of some I took sandpaper 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.279
 and I thought the blade 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.319
 it's the same secret it's nice 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.759
 melbourne which is more than a little polish 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.929
 it was relatively 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:49.549
 but hey so we offered so far so that the giant episode e a 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.049

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.779
 more for the work we do 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.499
 we will find a little 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.499
 this way 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.679
 a little ass long time 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:04.889
 serious people vermorel 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.019
 without getting up in the morning 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 so we still followed the extinguisher 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.099
 are also already served applies a little bit better 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.569
 we know we will go 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.619
 in sicily 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.849
 so it's a sparkling brand Saint-brevin-les-pins 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.139
 according to him too but I can tell you that the smiling boy 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.509
 me too that makes good memories 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:32.499
 to tell you everything he had glasses a bit like me and she gave him 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.650
 finished in slip 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.959
 on the parking lot of the nightclub 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.269
 so 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.339
 to buy is very very good 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 and of course and now 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.829
 the best for the end 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.289
 the little baton 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.679
 alister 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:56.099
 aluminum so percent of our friend e basta has already made a video victim 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.719
 national as much tell you that everything 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.199
 mathus amounts that we can think of laughing 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.480
 so for me I personally advised them that it has a cost 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.700
 it's clear that it's worth I'm here more than a hundred euros a year 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.359
 but for a hundred these formidable these fearsome 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.509
 So here is 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.269
 do not tell me that you will not mind me because I do not know 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.369
 not much with a knife in all directions in me I begin the analyst so here is 

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:21.799
 all reviews are good 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:22.819
 that's all 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.940
