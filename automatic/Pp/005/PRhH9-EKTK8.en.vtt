ever owned this is number six today
we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> talk<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.389> gaps<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
we're going to talk about gaps the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.470 
we're going to talk about gaps the
spacing<00:00:11.099> between<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> tiles<00:00:11.820> if<00:00:12.030> you're

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
spacing between the tiles if you're

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.999 
spacing between the tiles if you're
looking<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.840> make<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.080> job<00:00:13.259> look<00:00:13.530> right<00:00:13.740> you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
looking to make the job look right you

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.359 
looking to make the job look right you
make<00:00:14.820> sure<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.269> all<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> your<00:00:15.660> gaps<00:00:15.960> are<00:00:16.369> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
make sure that all of your gaps are the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.310 
make sure that all of your gaps are the
same<00:00:17.580> everywhere<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> tile

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
same everywhere you have to have a tile

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.220 
same everywhere you have to have a tile
saw<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.770> decent<00:00:20.580> tile<00:00:20.730> saw<00:00:20.970> when<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.810> cut<00:00:22.080> this

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
saw a decent tile saw when you cut this

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.759 
saw a decent tile saw when you cut this
stuff<00:00:22.880> what<00:00:23.880> I've<00:00:24.000> learned<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
stuff what I've learned is that the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
stuff what I've learned is that the
piece<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> keep<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.510> want<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> keep

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
piece you want to keep you want to keep

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.290 
piece you want to keep you want to keep
your<00:00:27.990> finger<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:30.179> you're

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
your finger on it because when you're

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.849 
your finger on it because when you're
cutting<00:00:30.660> you're<00:00:31.050> coming<00:00:31.349> down<00:00:31.500> through<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
cutting you're coming down through the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.160 
cutting you're coming down through the
middle<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.369> cutting<00:00:32.669> you'll<00:00:33.600> tend<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
middle on your cutting you'll tend to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.950 
middle on your cutting you'll tend to
break<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> end<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.640> it'll<00:00:36.210> it'll<00:00:36.690> come

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
break at the end and it'll it'll come

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.350 
break at the end and it'll it'll come
loose<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:38.219> able<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.520> come<00:00:38.730> loose<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.180> make

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
loose if it's able to come loose it make

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
loose if it's able to come loose it make
it<00:00:39.570> may<00:00:39.719> break<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.320> may<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.879> great

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it may break and you may have a great

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
it may break and you may have a great
big<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.600> end<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.230> that's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
big thing on the end of it here that's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.220 
big thing on the end of it here that's
that's<00:00:44.129> needs<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.910> cut<00:00:45.120> off<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.840> cut

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that's needs to be cut off and you cut

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
that's needs to be cut off and you cut
them<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> gap<00:00:47.700> that's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
them so that you don't have a gap that's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.760 
them so that you don't have a gap that's
any<00:00:48.120> wider<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.320> narrower<00:00:49.760> than<00:00:50.760> any<00:00:51.180> other<00:00:51.390> gap

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
any wider or narrower than any other gap

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.990 
any wider or narrower than any other gap
try<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> gaps<00:00:53.550> turn<00:00:53.850> out

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
try to make all the gaps turn out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.299 
try to make all the gaps turn out
exactly<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.440> spacing<00:00:55.949> between<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
exactly right the spacing between the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
exactly right the spacing between the
tiles<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.789> try<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> spacing

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
tiles you try to make the spacing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.060 
tiles you try to make the spacing
between<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.199> tiles<00:00:58.530> consistent<00:00:59.280> everywhere

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
between the tiles consistent everywhere

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
between the tiles consistent everywhere
because<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:04.199> eye<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.589> see<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because if it's not your eye will see it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 
because if it's not your eye will see it
it's<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.119> about<00:01:06.390> lining<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> tiles<00:01:07.500> just

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's all about lining up the tiles just

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
it's all about lining up the tiles just
just<00:01:08.189> exactly<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> have

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
just exactly the way you want to have

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
just exactly the way you want to have
them<00:01:09.360> lined<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:13.950> also<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
them lined up and it's also about the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
them lined up and it's also about the
pattern<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.560> what<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> worry<00:01:17.130> about

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
pattern and what I have to worry about

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.350 
pattern and what I have to worry about
here<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.530> my<00:01:19.530> pattern<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:23.970> I've<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
here is my pattern and what I've got to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
here is my pattern and what I've got to
worry<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.840> next<00:01:25.080> tiles<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.770> cut<00:01:26.070> are

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
worry about the next tiles I cut are

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
worry about the next tiles I cut are
going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.580> cut<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.450> make<00:01:27.600> sure<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> pattern

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
going to be cut to make sure the pattern

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
going to be cut to make sure the pattern
works<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> stair<00:01:30.180> step<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
works out it's kind of a stair step that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
works out it's kind of a stair step that
I've<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.329> got<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> make

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I've got going on here I got to make

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.929 
I've got going on here I got to make
sure<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.780> pattern<00:01:34.110> worked<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> would<00:01:35.850> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
sure the pattern worked out so would be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.300 
sure the pattern worked out so would be
a<00:01:35.970> new<00:01:36.150> tile<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:38.100> these

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
a new tile going in there and then these

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
a new tile going in there and then these
didn't<00:01:38.579> stick<00:01:38.820> very<00:01:39.000> well<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.540> three

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
didn't stick very well there's three

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:54.290 
didn't stick very well there's three
more<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> didn't<00:01:40.439> stick<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.860> well

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.740 

see<00:01:55.300> see<00:01:55.870> it's<00:01:56.830> not<00:01:57.010> gonna<00:01:57.100> be<00:01:57.280> square<00:02:00.750> it's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
see see it's not gonna be square it's

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.530 
see see it's not gonna be square it's
the<00:02:02.050> only<00:02:02.200> one<00:02:02.380> I've<00:02:02.560> seen<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.010> far<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:04.240> entire

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
the only one I've seen so far the entire

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.040 
the only one I've seen so far the entire
batch<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.840> wasn't<00:02:05.350> cut<00:02:05.500> right<00:02:06.360> tile<00:02:07.360> has<00:02:07.630> got

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
batch that wasn't cut right tile has got

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.190 
batch that wasn't cut right tile has got
to<00:02:08.200> come<00:02:08.320> back<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.740> because<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:09.340> not<00:02:09.400> square

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
to come back out because it's not square

son of again if the tiles are square
once<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.440> set<00:02:56.710> all<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.040> tiles<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:58.420> have

which is a cement material it's got a
little<00:03:11.770> bit<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:11.980> sand<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.880> then<00:03:13.330> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
little bit more sand in it then the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.290 
little bit more sand in it then the
thinset<00:03:13.780> mortar<00:03:13.989> has<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.830> it's<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.790> particular

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
thinset mortar has and it's a particular

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
tile color today we learned about gaps

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.590 
tile color today we learned about gaps
the<00:03:22.360> spacing<00:03:22.900> between<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.260> tiles
