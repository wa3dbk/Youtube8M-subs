hi<00:00:06.509> mr.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.470 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.140 

2012<00:00:12.470> and<00:00:13.090> looking<00:00:14.090> at<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:14.480> new<00:00:14.890> 60<00:00:15.890> ta<00:00:16.220> this

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
2012 and looking at the new 60 ta this

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.540 
2012 and looking at the new 60 ta this
is<00:00:17.300> our<00:00:17.450> new<00:00:17.660> digital<00:00:18.170> SLR<00:00:18.680> that<00:00:18.920> specifically

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
is our new digital SLR that specifically

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.179 
is our new digital SLR that specifically
optimized<00:00:20.180> for<00:00:20.330> astrophotography<00:00:21.040> now<00:00:22.040> it's

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
optimized for astrophotography now it's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.490 
optimized for astrophotography now it's
based<00:00:22.430> on<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.700> EOS<00:00:23.029> 60d<00:00:23.480> body<00:00:23.779> that<00:00:24.320> we

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
based on the EOS 60d body that we

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.710 
based on the EOS 60d body that we
introduced<00:00:24.919> last<00:00:25.160> year<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:26.360> it<00:00:26.540> has<00:00:26.689> a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
introduced last year but it has a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.260 
introduced last year but it has a
special<00:00:27.439> filter<00:00:27.950> over<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.369> sensor<00:00:28.610> that<00:00:28.970> it

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
special filter over the sensor that it

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.330 
special filter over the sensor that it
passes<00:00:29.660> three<00:00:30.140> times<00:00:30.380> as<00:00:30.590> much<00:00:30.800> on<00:00:31.160> the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
passes three times as much on the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.639 
passes three times as much on the
hydrogen<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.000> help<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.300> wavelength<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.500> that

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
hydrogen to help a wavelength so that

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.200 
hydrogen to help a wavelength so that
you<00:00:33.770> get<00:00:33.950> better<00:00:34.210> astrophotography

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
you get better astrophotography

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.350 
you get better astrophotography
specifically<00:00:35.930> of<00:00:36.140> Rhenish<00:00:36.500> nebula<00:00:37.360> camera

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.389 
specifically of Rhenish nebula camera
itself<00:00:38.720> is<00:00:39.380> an<00:00:39.680> 18<00:00:39.980> megapixel<00:00:41.980> image<00:00:42.980> sensor

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
with a digit 4 processor it also has all

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.130 
with a digit 4 processor it also has all
the<00:00:46.489> compatibility<00:00:47.359> with<00:00:47.449> all<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.840> different

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
the compatibility with all the different

the compatibility with all the different
helios<00:00:48.859> lenses<00:00:49.370> i'm<00:00:49.940> showing<00:00:50.269> it<00:00:50.390> with<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.539> 10

helios lenses i'm showing it with a 10
to<00:00:50.870> 22<00:00:51.199> lens<00:00:51.590> but<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.160> course<00:00:52.399> for

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
to 22 lens but of course for

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.029 
to 22 lens but of course for
astrophotography<00:00:53.600> you're<00:00:54.199> more<00:00:54.379> likely<00:00:54.620> to

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
astrophotography you're more likely to

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.979 
astrophotography you're more likely to
remove<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.519> lens<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.000> put<00:00:56.239> on<00:00:56.390> an<00:00:56.510> adapter

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
remove the lens and put on an adapter

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.349 
remove the lens and put on an adapter
and<00:00:57.199> then<00:00:57.289> attached<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.859> telescope<00:00:58.399> one<00:00:59.269> of

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
and then attached to a telescope one of

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.090 
and then attached to a telescope one of
the<00:00:59.420> nice<00:00:59.539> things<00:00:59.600> about<00:01:00.079> working<00:01:00.499> with<00:01:00.710> this

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
the nice things about working with this

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.369 
the nice things about working with this
camera<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.730> telescope<00:01:02.210> is<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:03.079> it<00:01:03.170> has<00:01:03.350> a

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
camera with a telescope is that it has a

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.890 
camera with a telescope is that it has a
folding<00:01:04.100> finder<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.580> very<00:01:04.910> angle<00:01:05.330> finder<00:01:05.540> hear

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
folding finder a very angle finder hear

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.080 
folding finder a very angle finder hear
that<00:01:06.110> did<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.590> can<00:01:06.890> position<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.700> even

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
that did you can position so that even

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.850 
that did you can position so that even
when<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.300> camera<00:01:08.870> might<00:01:09.110> be<00:01:09.230> inverted<00:01:09.710> you

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
when the camera might be inverted you

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.880 
when the camera might be inverted you
can<00:01:10.040> still<00:01:10.280> look<00:01:10.400> at<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.700> very<00:01:10.850> very<00:01:11.090> closely

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
can still look at it very very closely

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.640 
can still look at it very very closely
now<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:12.950> kit<00:01:13.370> for<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.030> camera<00:01:14.330> has<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.380> retail

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
now the kit for this camera has a retail

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.760 
now the kit for this camera has a retail
price<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.100> 1499<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.390> includes<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.290> special

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770

be<00:01:40.840> used<00:01:41.109> it's<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.920> number<00:01:42.159> one<00:01:42.189> question<00:01:42.490> can

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
be used it's the number one question can

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.609 
be used it's the number one question can
be<00:01:42.939> used<00:01:43.210> for<00:01:43.329> regular<00:01:43.840> photography<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.590> well

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
be used for regular photography as well

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.249 
be used for regular photography as well
as<00:01:45.149> astrophotography<00:01:46.149> in<00:01:46.479> order<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.899> do<00:01:47.109> it

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
as astrophotography in order to do it

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.539 
as astrophotography in order to do it
for<00:01:47.380> regular<00:01:47.679> photography<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:48.459> are

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
for regular photography we are

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.639 
for regular photography we are
recommending<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.479> put<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> hot<00:01:50.170> air

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
recommending that you put a hot air

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.429 
recommending that you put a hot air
filter<00:01:51.280> on<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.579> front<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.329> lens<00:01:52.539> to

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
filter on the front of the lens to

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.529 
filter on the front of the lens to
basically<00:01:53.979> give<00:01:54.399> back<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.909> IR<00:01:55.240> cut<00:01:55.479> filter

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
basically give back the IR cut filter

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.719 
basically give back the IR cut filter
that<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.140> lost<00:01:56.380> when<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.859> went<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.159> Astro

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
that you lost when you went to the Astro

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.399 
that you lost when you went to the Astro
film<00:01:58.000> camera<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:59.609> 60da<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.719> already<00:02:02.229> in<00:02:02.319> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
film camera so 60da it's already in the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.760 
film camera so 60da it's already in the
