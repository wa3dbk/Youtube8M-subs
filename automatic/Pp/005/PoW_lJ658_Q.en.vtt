that's<00:04:15.489> out<00:04:15.670> there<00:04:15.820> in<00:04:16.030> an<00:04:16.150> angle<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.410> I'm

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
that's out there in an angle so I'm

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.680 
that's out there in an angle so I'm
gonna<00:04:17.680> have<00:04:17.859> to<00:04:17.979> do<00:04:18.100> next<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.640> wire<00:04:19.239> up<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
gonna have to do next is wire up the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.290 
gonna have to do next is wire up the
d-pad<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.500> ABXY<00:04:21.160> buttons<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.970> figure<00:04:22.240> out

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
d-pad the ABXY buttons and figure out

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.460 
d-pad the ABXY buttons and figure out
where<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.540> put<00:04:22.780> them<00:04:22.990> if<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.140> look<00:04:23.260> at<00:04:23.380> the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
where to put them if you look at the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.219 
where to put them if you look at the
game<00:04:23.710> right<00:04:24.160> there<00:04:24.220> I've<00:04:24.610> got<00:04:24.880> four<00:04:25.810> buttons

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
game right there I've got four buttons

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.930 
game right there I've got four buttons
that<00:04:26.740> are<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.010> game<00:04:27.190> I've<00:04:27.520> also<00:04:27.669> got<00:04:27.910> a

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
that are in the game I've also got a

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.390 
that are in the game I've also got a
shifter<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:29.320> I've<00:04:29.680> got<00:04:29.890> buttons<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
shifter and I've got buttons on the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.590 
shifter and I've got buttons on the
steering<00:04:30.729> wheel<00:04:30.820> although<00:04:31.240> there's<00:04:31.450> two

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
steering wheel although there's two

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.540 
steering wheel although there's two
buttons<00:04:31.990> they're<00:04:32.260> currently<00:04:32.620> wired<00:04:32.979> up<00:04:33.280> so

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
buttons they're currently wired up so

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.930 
buttons they're currently wired up so
that<00:04:33.700> they<00:04:33.820> both<00:04:34.030> just<00:04:34.270> actually<00:04:34.479> one<00:04:35.200> switch

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
that they both just actually one switch

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.880 
that they both just actually one switch
there's<00:04:36.940> plenty<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.360> room<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.780> can<00:04:37.990> cut<00:04:38.560> off<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
there's plenty of room I can cut off the

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.300 
there's plenty of room I can cut off the
factory<00:04:39.250> connector<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:41.169> run<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> individual

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
factory connector and run the individual

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.460 
factory connector and run the individual
wires<00:04:42.640> down<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.720> you've<00:04:43.900> got<00:04:44.110> two

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
wires down so that you've got two

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.029 
wires down so that you've got two
buttons<00:04:44.890> there<00:04:46.140> so<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.410> only<00:04:47.530> problem<00:04:47.680> is

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
buttons there so the only problem is

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.100 
buttons there so the only problem is
trying<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.789> figure<00:04:48.850> out<00:04:49.180> what<00:04:49.450> buttons<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.900> want

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
trying to figure out what buttons I want

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.690 
trying to figure out what buttons I want
to<00:04:50.200> do<00:04:50.320> what<00:04:50.650> like<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:50.979> said<00:04:51.160> I've<00:04:51.250> got<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.520> home

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
to do what like I said I've got the home

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.219 
to do what like I said I've got the home
button<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.180> start<00:04:52.270> button<00:04:52.840> down<00:04:52.870> on<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
button and the start button down on the

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.380 
button and the start button down on the
coin<00:04:53.440> door<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.400> big<00:04:54.729> green<00:04:54.910> button<00:04:54.970> that

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
coin door so the big green button that

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.170 
coin door so the big green button that
says<00:04:55.600> start<00:04:55.960> doesn't<00:04:56.380> need<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.650> say<00:04:56.860> start<00:04:57.310> I'm

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
says start doesn't need to say start I'm

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.180 
says start doesn't need to say start I'm
thinking<00:04:58.539> perhaps<00:04:58.780> that'll<00:04:59.229> be<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.500> button

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
thinking perhaps that'll be the a button

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.210 
thinking perhaps that'll be the a button
and<00:05:00.419> then<00:05:01.419> what<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.440> really<00:05:02.740> should<00:05:02.770> do<00:05:03.039> is<00:05:03.190> just

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
and then what I really should do is just

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.590 
and then what I really should do is just
play<00:05:03.580> these<00:05:03.729> driving<00:05:04.120> games<00:05:04.300> with<00:05:04.510> the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
play these driving games with the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.270 
play these driving games with the
controller<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.229> figure<00:05:05.530> out<00:05:05.650> what<00:05:05.890> buttons

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
controller and figure out what buttons

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.010 
controller and figure out what buttons
are<00:05:06.460> needed<00:05:06.789> so<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.180> figure<00:05:07.300> out<00:05:07.419> what<00:05:07.660> it's

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
are needed so I can figure out what it's

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.439 
are needed so I can figure out what it's
the<00:05:08.140> best<00:05:08.350> button

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
the best button

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.999 
the best button
up<00:05:09.629> to<00:05:09.809> one<00:05:10.020> two<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:10.469> three<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:12.539> wheel

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
up to one two and three and the wheel

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.920 
up to one two and three and the wheel
could<00:05:14.009> do<00:05:14.159> up<00:05:14.430> shift<00:05:14.729> down<00:05:14.939> shift<00:05:15.330> on<00:05:15.629> the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
could do up shift down shift on the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.089 
could do up shift down shift on the
wheel<00:05:16.249> it<00:05:17.249> does<00:05:17.430> not<00:05:17.639> have<00:05:17.909> paddle<00:05:18.419> shifters

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
wheel it does not have paddle shifters

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.399 
wheel it does not have paddle shifters
so<00:05:20.099> that's<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:21.029> distinct<00:05:21.479> possibility<00:05:21.509> is<00:05:22.379> to

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
so that's a distinct possibility is to

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.369 
so that's a distinct possibility is to
have<00:05:23.099> that<00:05:23.279> set<00:05:23.550> up<00:05:23.699> up<00:05:23.969> shift<00:05:24.270> down<00:05:24.509> shift<00:05:24.870> if

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
have that set up up shift down shift if

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.070 
have that set up up shift down shift if
I<00:05:25.559> set<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.830> up<00:05:25.979> for<00:05:26.099> something<00:05:26.430> else<00:05:26.930> like<00:05:27.930> the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
I set it up for something else like the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.290 
I set it up for something else like the
a<00:05:28.110> button<00:05:28.650> or<00:05:28.830> B<00:05:29.009> button<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.610> have<00:05:29.879> to<00:05:29.999> make<00:05:30.150> sure

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
a button or B button I have to make sure

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.399 
a button or B button I have to make sure
it<00:05:30.419> doesn't<00:05:30.569> hurt<00:05:30.839> anything<00:05:31.050> if<00:05:31.289> you

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
it doesn't hurt anything if you

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:32.689 
it doesn't hurt anything if you
accidentally<00:05:31.949> get<00:05:32.099> it<00:05:32.189> when<00:05:32.309> you're<00:05:32.400> driving

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
accidentally get it when you're driving

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.279 
accidentally get it when you're driving
because<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.330> location<00:05:33.629> of<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.930> steering

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
because of the location of the steering

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.070 
because of the location of the steering
wheel<00:05:34.559> and<00:05:34.830> your<00:05:34.919> hands<00:05:35.599> it's<00:05:36.599> very<00:05:36.689> possible

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
wheel and your hands it's very possible

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.809 
wheel and your hands it's very possible
to<00:05:37.349> accidentally<00:05:37.889> hit<00:05:38.009> those<00:05:38.159> buttons<00:05:38.430> while

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
to accidentally hit those buttons while

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.969 
to accidentally hit those buttons while
you're<00:05:38.999> steering<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:40.770> shifter<00:05:42.770> yeah<00:05:43.770> not

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
you're steering the shifter yeah not

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.040 
you're steering the shifter yeah not
sure<00:05:44.009> there<00:05:44.490> what<00:05:45.029> to<00:05:45.180> do

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
sure there what to do

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.070 
sure there what to do
I<00:05:46.729> haven't<00:05:47.729> again<00:05:48.270> looked<00:05:48.539> at<00:05:48.629> the<00:05:48.719> driving

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
I haven't again looked at the driving

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.110 
I haven't again looked at the driving
games<00:05:49.259> to<00:05:49.409> see<00:05:49.620> how<00:05:49.830> they<00:05:50.039> shift<00:05:50.339> if<00:05:50.639> they<00:05:50.819> just

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
games to see how they shift if they just

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.189 
games to see how they shift if they just
do<00:05:52.370> sequential<00:05:53.370> shift<00:05:53.819> one<00:05:54.599> button<00:05:54.900> shifts

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
do sequential shift one button shifts

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.779 
do sequential shift one button shifts
you<00:05:55.289> up<00:05:55.409> a<00:05:55.529> gear<00:05:55.740> one<00:05:55.949> button<00:05:56.249> shifts<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.580> down

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
you up a gear one button shifts you down

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.119 
you up a gear one button shifts you down
a<00:05:56.819> gear<00:05:57.180> or<00:05:57.449> if<00:05:57.839> they<00:05:57.960> can<00:05:58.139> be<00:05:58.259> set<00:05:58.529> up<00:05:58.680> for<00:05:59.069> a

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
a gear or if they can be set up for a

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.899 
a gear or if they can be set up for a
four<00:05:59.460> position<00:05:59.669> shifter<00:06:01.159> if<00:06:02.159> they<00:06:02.370> can<00:06:02.610> and

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
four position shifter if they can and

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.579 
four position shifter if they can and
that<00:06:02.939> should<00:06:03.419> be<00:06:03.569> pretty<00:06:03.779> easy<00:06:03.899> but<00:06:04.349> again

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589 
that should be pretty easy but again

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.459 
that should be pretty easy but again
what<00:06:05.219> buttons<00:06:05.669> would<00:06:05.969> that<00:06:06.210> connect<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:07.110> on

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
what buttons would that connect to on

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.239 
what buttons would that connect to on
the<00:06:08.240> controller<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:09.449> guess<00:06:09.599> I<00:06:09.719> can<00:06:09.839> also<00:06:09.960> do<00:06:10.169> a

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:10.249 
the controller I guess I can also do a

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.969 
the controller I guess I can also do a
d-pad<00:06:11.249> one<00:06:11.610> two<00:06:11.789> three<00:06:12.029> four<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.389> problem<00:06:12.719> is

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
d-pad one two three four the problem is

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.909 
d-pad one two three four the problem is
that<00:06:13.979> there's<00:06:14.729> always<00:06:15.029> a<00:06:15.379> active<00:06:16.379> button<00:06:16.710> you

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
that there's always a active button you

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.369 
that there's always a active button you
can<00:06:17.039> see<00:06:17.159> right<00:06:17.339> now<00:06:17.460> it's<00:06:17.669> in<00:06:18.539> position<00:06:19.110> one

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.379 
can see right now it's in position one

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.839 
can see right now it's in position one
so<00:06:19.620> it's<00:06:19.770> either<00:06:19.860> one<00:06:20.129> two<00:06:20.279> three<00:06:20.550> four

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
so it's either one two three four

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.179 
so it's either one two three four
there's<00:06:21.210> no<00:06:21.389> neutral<00:06:22.139> position<00:06:22.860> where<00:06:23.039> there

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:23.189 
there's no neutral position where there

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.239 
there's no neutral position where there
are<00:06:23.370> no<00:06:23.550> active<00:06:24.089> buttons<00:06:24.680> so<00:06:25.680> if<00:06:25.709> I<00:06:25.889> hook<00:06:26.069> that

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:26.249 
are no active buttons so if I hook that

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:27.829 
are no active buttons so if I hook that
up<00:06:26.310> for<00:06:26.669> shifting<00:06:27.029> I<00:06:27.120> have<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.449> make<00:06:27.599> sure<00:06:27.810> that

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839 
up for shifting I have to make sure that

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.989 
up for shifting I have to make sure that
in<00:06:28.349> the<00:06:28.439> game<00:06:28.680> if<00:06:28.889> you<00:06:29.009> just<00:06:29.189> hold<00:06:29.490> whatever

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
in the game if you just hold whatever

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.209 
in the game if you just hold whatever
button<00:06:30.270> down<00:06:30.569> shifts<00:06:31.289> it<00:06:31.409> doesn't<00:06:31.740> cause<00:06:32.189> a

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
button down shifts it doesn't cause a

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.159 
button down shifts it doesn't cause a
problem<00:06:32.550> otherwise<00:06:32.879> I<00:06:33.120> might<00:06:33.270> have<00:06:33.419> to<00:06:33.569> look

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
problem otherwise I might have to look

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.070 
problem otherwise I might have to look
into<00:06:35.029> where<00:06:36.029> I<00:06:36.060> can<00:06:36.300> get<00:06:36.419> a<00:06:36.449> circuit<00:06:36.930> that

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
into where I can get a circuit that

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.670 
into where I can get a circuit that
would<00:06:37.789> send<00:06:38.789> one<00:06:38.999> keystroke<00:06:39.240> or<00:06:40.139> one<00:06:40.349> button

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
would send one keystroke or one button

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.499 
would send one keystroke or one button
push<00:06:40.979> sorry<00:06:41.759> and<00:06:42.089> then<00:06:43.819> and<00:06:44.819> then<00:06:45.469> turn<00:06:46.469> it<00:06:46.589> off

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
push sorry and then and then turn it off

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:51.019 
push sorry and then and then turn it off
so<00:06:48.509> that's<00:06:48.599> the<00:06:49.499> progress<00:06:49.949> with<00:06:50.159> today

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029 
so that's the progress with today

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.360 
so that's the progress with today
everything's<00:06:51.749> shoved<00:06:52.560> in<00:06:52.770> the<00:06:52.889> coin<00:06:53.099> door

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
everything's shoved in the coin door

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.929 
everything's shoved in the coin door
I'll<00:06:53.789> mount<00:06:54.209> those<00:06:54.949> somewhere<00:06:55.949> there's<00:06:56.789> no

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
I'll mount those somewhere there's no

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:57.529 
I'll mount those somewhere there's no
small

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
small

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.659 
small
I'm<00:06:58.169> thinking<00:06:58.620> maybe<00:06:58.770> mounted<00:06:59.219> to<00:06:59.370> a<00:06:59.399> small

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
I'm thinking maybe mounted to a small

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.519 
I'm thinking maybe mounted to a small
piece<00:06:59.909> of<00:06:59.939> wood<00:07:00.240> and<00:07:00.479> then<00:07:00.569> put<00:07:00.779> them<00:07:00.870> in<00:07:01.349> the

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:01.529 
piece of wood and then put them in the

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:03.499 
piece of wood and then put them in the
coin<00:07:01.709> door<00:07:01.949> up<00:07:02.129> against<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:02.669> side<00:07:03.060> wall<00:07:03.479> or

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
coin door up against the side wall or

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.059 
coin door up against the side wall or
something<00:07:04.639> and<00:07:05.639> then<00:07:06.209> figuring<00:07:06.629> out<00:07:07.039> where<00:07:08.039> to

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:08.069 
something and then figuring out where to

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.070 
something and then figuring out where to
wire<00:07:08.279> up<00:07:08.490> my<00:07:08.610> buttons<00:07:08.939> so<00:07:09.449> it's<00:07:09.659> coming<00:07:09.959> along

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
wire up my buttons so it's coming along

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.680 
wire up my buttons so it's coming along
pretty<00:07:10.139> good<00:07:10.499> so<00:07:10.649> far
