00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
 the difference of this category 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 cars are 100% electric and have emission 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.050
 zero pollutants you can forget 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.739
 that chat of electric cars are 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.930
 slow

 these machines can make up to 150 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.219
 miles per hour or about 240 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.469

 formula 1 that reaches 340 kilometers 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 per hour but it is a good speed not to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.520
 people saw formula in action in a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 parking and then he climbed streep 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.270
 the avenue where are all the main 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430

 grassi that will compete in the category 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.340
 this year 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 the first thing that attracts attention is the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.760
 noise instead of that snore 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.950
 characteristic of engines driven by 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 fossil fuel we hear something 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 more raucous like the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.270
 remote control cart 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.810
 only much louder than the toy

 automotive class racing goes 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.530
 happen in urban circuits where 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 electric vehicles must gain ground 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 very soon and who believes that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.319
