actually there's a lot to know about
this<00:00:26.250> machine<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.660> just

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
this machine it's not going to be just

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200 
this machine it's not going to be just
an<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.380> box<00:00:28.410> push<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.310> system

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
know about this machine the first thing

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.069 
know about this machine the first thing
that<00:00:42.000> you're<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> need<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.840> test

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that you're really going to need to test

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
that you're really going to need to test
as<00:00:43.410> soon<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> machine<00:00:44.550> put

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
as soon as you get the machine put

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
as soon as you get the machine put
together<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.680> actually<00:00:46.680> functioning

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
together and actually functioning

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
together and actually functioning
properly<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.450> gonna<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> top<00:00:49.170> heater

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
properly it's gonna be the top heater

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.540 
properly it's gonna be the top heater
and<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.969> part<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> right<00:00:52.079> here

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and that is this part of it right here

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.979 
and that is this part of it right here
what<00:00:53.550> we're<00:00:53.699> testing<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
what we're testing this for is the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.610 
what we're testing this for is the
evenness<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.739> heating<00:00:56.340> coming<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
evenness of heating coming out of it and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.720 
evenness of heating coming out of it and
what<00:00:58.620> you'll<00:00:58.770> need<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> put<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
what you'll need to do is put it on a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.260 
what you'll need to do is put it on a
profile<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.570> stops<00:01:00.870> starts<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.770> top<00:01:01.980> heater

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
profile that stops starts the top heater

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
profile that stops starts the top heater
right<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> bat<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> lot<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
right off the bat there's a lot of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
right off the bat there's a lot of
profiles<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> forms<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
profiles out there in the forms that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
profiles out there in the forms that
actually<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.040> start<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> bottom

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
actually have you start at the bottom

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.420 
actually have you start at the bottom
either<00:01:09.060> bottom<00:01:09.960> plates<00:01:10.170> first<00:01:10.439> heat<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
either bottom plates first heat up the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.370 
either bottom plates first heat up the
board<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.090> start<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.750> heater<00:01:13.020> for

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
board and then start the top heater for

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
board and then start the top heater for
this<00:01:13.530> tutorial<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.460> need<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> start

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this tutorial you're gonna need to start

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
this tutorial you're gonna need to start
the<00:01:15.270> top<00:01:15.600> heater<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.799> bat

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the top heater off right off the bat

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.289 
the top heater off right off the bat
because<00:01:17.189> we're<00:01:17.369> gonna<00:01:17.460> turn<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> bottom

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
because we're gonna turn off the bottom

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
because we're gonna turn off the bottom
plates<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.820> no

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
plates so that way there's no

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
plates so that way there's no
interruption<00:01:21.259> with<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.470> video-tutorial

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
interruption with this video-tutorial

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.820 
interruption with this video-tutorial
so<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:24.810> gonna<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.350> turn<00:01:25.680> off

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so what we're gonna do is just turn off

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
so what we're gonna do is just turn off
the<00:01:25.860> bottom<00:01:26.220> plates<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.700> they're<00:01:27.330> actually

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the bottom plates now they're actually

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
the bottom plates now they're actually
already<00:01:27.810> off<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.979> buttons<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
already off these two buttons here this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
already off these two buttons here this
one<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.110> need<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
one and this one need to be in the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.999 
one and this one need to be in the
bottom<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> downward<00:01:33.420> position<00:01:34.009> if

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
bottom or the downward position if

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
bottom or the downward position if
they're<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.850> flip<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> down

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
they're up like that just flip it down

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
they're up like that just flip it down
and<00:01:37.079> usually<00:01:37.770> nine<00:01:37.950> times<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> 10<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.820> your

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and usually nine times out of 10 if your

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
and usually nine times out of 10 if your
systems<00:01:39.329> wired<00:01:39.600> properly<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.770> means<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
systems wired properly that means that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.810 
systems wired properly that means that
the<00:01:41.579> plates<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.210> gonna<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.570> off<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.579> will

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the plates are gonna be off and we will

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.510 
the plates are gonna be off and we will
go<00:01:44.970> ahead<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.329> start<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> profile<00:01:46.430> just<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
go ahead and start the profile just to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.800 
go ahead and start the profile just to
kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.939> over<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.420> system<00:01:48.810> real<00:01:49.049> quick

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
kind of go over the system real quick

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.450 
kind of go over the system real quick
we're<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.140> part<00:01:52.439> number<00:01:52.740> seven<00:01:53.189> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
we're actually on part number seven I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
we're actually on part number seven I
don't<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.090> we've<00:01:54.210> changed<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.899> at

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
don't think we've changed this one at

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.460 
don't think we've changed this one at
all

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
all

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
all
so<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> automatically<00:01:56.729> stops<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.570> starts

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so that automatically stops or starts

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.069 
so that automatically stops or starts
the<00:01:58.170> top<00:01:58.380> heater<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.270> doing<00:02:00.570> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the top heater and what this is doing is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990 
the top heater and what this is doing is
we're<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> SV<00:02:02.310> mode<00:02:02.549> right<00:02:02.820> now

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
we're actually on the SV mode right now

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.459 
we're actually on the SV mode right now
if<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> hit<00:02:03.390> display<00:02:03.869> you'll<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.200> through<00:02:04.229> a

actually<00:02:13.900> go<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.050> MV<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.980> what<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.550> MV<00:02:16.000> stands

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
actually go to MV and what the MV stands

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.210 
actually go to MV and what the MV stands
for<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.960> amount<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.560> power<00:02:17.830> that's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
for is the amount of power that's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.370 
for is the amount of power that's
getting<00:02:18.610> pushed<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.450> top<00:02:19.660> heater<00:02:20.020> and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
getting pushed to the top heater and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.470 
getting pushed to the top heater and
that's<00:02:21.010> pretty<00:02:21.280> much<00:02:21.430> all<00:02:21.640> regulated<00:02:22.180> by<00:02:22.330> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that's pretty much all regulated by the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.260 
that's pretty much all regulated by the
TC<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> TC<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.610> nowhere<00:02:24.940> near<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
TC because the TC is nowhere near the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.750 
TC because the TC is nowhere near the
top<00:02:25.300> heater<00:02:25.750> right<00:02:25.960> now<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.830> board<00:02:27.130> it's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
top heater right now or the board it's

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.650 
top heater right now or the board it's
going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.090> at<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> hundred<00:02:28.450> percent

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
going to be at a hundred percent

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.290 
going to be at a hundred percent
throughout<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.440> tutorial<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.030> we'll<00:02:31.180> go

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
throughout this tutorial so we'll go

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.060 
throughout this tutorial so we'll go
ahead<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.630> shut<00:02:31.810> off<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.110> lights<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:33.040> have

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
ahead and shut off the lights we have

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.020 
ahead and shut off the lights we have
started<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> profile<00:02:34.180> already<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:36.030> we'll

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
started the profile already and we'll

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.120 
started the profile already and we'll
just<00:02:37.240> wait<00:02:37.420> for<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.750> top<00:02:38.410> heater<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.890> start

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
just wait for this top heater to start

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.060 
just wait for this top heater to start
glowing<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.350> reason<00:02:41.620> why<00:02:41.740> we're<00:02:41.920> doing

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
glowing and the reason why we're doing

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.850 
glowing and the reason why we're doing
this<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:42.880> we<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.180> actually<00:02:43.360> show<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
this is so we can actually show you a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.220 
this is so we can actually show you a
better<00:02:45.460> idea<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:46.060> what<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.720> top<00:02:46.900> plate<00:02:47.200> is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
better idea of what the top plate is

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.830 
better idea of what the top plate is
going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.800> doing<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.490> if<00:02:48.970> your<00:02:49.240> top<00:02:49.480> plate

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
going to be doing and if your top plate

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.010 
going to be doing and if your top plate
is<00:02:50.080> gonna<00:02:50.350> be<00:02:50.560> defective<00:02:50.980> or<00:02:51.340> not<00:02:51.810> right<00:02:52.810> now

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
is gonna be defective or not right now

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020 
is gonna be defective or not right now
we<00:02:53.080> can<00:02:53.410> actually<00:02:53.590> start<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.460> top<00:02:54.670> i

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
we can actually start to see the top i

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.960 
we can actually start to see the top i
plate<00:02:55.750> start<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.170> glow<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:57.790> off<00:02:57.940> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
plate start to glow and right off the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.510 
plate start to glow and right off the
bat<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.600> can<00:02:58.630> pretty<00:02:58.930> much<00:02:59.020> tell<00:02:59.440> that<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
bat you can pretty much tell that the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.960 
bat you can pretty much tell that the
top<00:03:01.030> plate<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.600> defective<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:03.550> because<00:03:03.820> of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
top plate is defective just because of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
top plate is defective just because of
the<00:03:04.030> area<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:04.660> glowing<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.170> right<00:03:05.380> now

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
the area that it's glowing in right now

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.570 
the area that it's glowing in right now
it's<00:03:06.280> actually<00:03:06.670> glowing<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.720> diagonal<00:03:08.110> path

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
it's actually glowing in a diagonal path

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.980 
it's actually glowing in a diagonal path
and<00:03:09.580> then<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:09.880> starting<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.270> glow<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.510> other

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
and then it's starting to glow in other

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.470 
and then it's starting to glow in other
different<00:03:11.470> areas<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.880> place<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.210> you<00:03:13.330> see

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
different areas the place that you see

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.120 
different areas the place that you see
it<00:03:13.570> glowing<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.050> most<00:03:14.290> right<00:03:14.590> now<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.800> where

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
it glowing the most right now is where

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.070 
it glowing the most right now is where
the<00:03:15.280> most<00:03:15.460> heats<00:03:15.760> gonna<00:03:15.940> radiate<00:03:16.450> from<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
the most heats gonna radiate from and

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.070 
the most heats gonna radiate from and
that<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:18.100> not<00:03:18.520> in<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.150> center<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.840> plate

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
that is not in the center of the plate

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.380 
that is not in the center of the plate
so<00:03:20.320> it's<00:03:20.590> gonna<00:03:20.709> cause<00:03:21.040> major<00:03:21.430> problems<00:03:21.640> with

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
so it's gonna cause major problems with

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.050 
so it's gonna cause major problems with
your<00:03:22.630> system<00:03:23.400> because<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.640> gonna<00:03:24.760> pretty

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
your system because it's gonna pretty

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.270 
your system because it's gonna pretty
much<00:03:25.150> heat<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.840> board<00:03:26.110> unevenly<00:03:26.860> it's<00:03:27.130> going

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
much heat the board unevenly it's going

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.810 
much heat the board unevenly it's going
to<00:03:27.340> heat<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.760> chip<00:03:28.030> unevenly<00:03:29.040> especially<00:03:30.040> if

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
to heat the chip unevenly especially if

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.000 
to heat the chip unevenly especially if
you<00:03:31.060> look<00:03:31.300> just<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.810> north<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.410> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
you look just to the north of the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.510 
you look just to the north of the
glowing<00:03:33.730> area<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.330> barely<00:03:34.630> glowing<00:03:35.170> at<00:03:35.320> all

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
glowing area it's barely glowing at all

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.040 
glowing area it's barely glowing at all
so<00:03:36.520> that's<00:03:36.730> really<00:03:36.940> gonna<00:03:37.209> cause<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.660> chip<00:03:37.900> to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
so that's really gonna cause the chip to

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.990 
so that's really gonna cause the chip to
heat<00:03:38.230> unevenly<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:39.580> actually<00:03:39.910> gonna

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
heat unevenly and it's actually gonna

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.540 
heat unevenly and it's actually gonna
pop<00:03:40.330> your<00:03:40.570> chip<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.830> actually<00:03:42.190> just<00:03:42.370> received

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
pop your chip we actually just received

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.750 
pop your chip we actually just received
this<00:03:43.000> plate<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.660> was<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.080> replacement<00:03:44.920> we<00:03:45.640> are

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
this plate it was a replacement we are

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.970 
this plate it was a replacement we are
doing<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.150> tests<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.660> now<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.830> is

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
doing the tests on it now and it is

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.400 
doing the tests on it now and it is
defective<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:49.510> can<00:03:49.630> actually<00:03:49.780> see<00:03:50.140> where<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
defective you can actually see where the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.410 
defective you can actually see where the
center<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.800> plate<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.209> plate

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
center of the plate is it's the plate

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.870 
center of the plate is it's the plate
that's<00:03:52.600> not<00:03:52.780> glowing<00:03:53.050> at<00:03:53.290> all<00:03:53.470> if<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.640> whole

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
that's not glowing at all if the whole

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.910 
that's not glowing at all if the whole
plate<00:03:55.180> was<00:03:55.420> glowing<00:03:55.720> evenly<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.650> didn't

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
plate was glowing evenly and it didn't

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.680 
plate was glowing evenly and it didn't
have<00:03:57.070> that<00:03:57.100> orange<00:03:57.730> spot<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.330> can<00:03:58.360> see

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
have that orange spot that you can see

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.470 
have that orange spot that you can see
right<00:03:58.959> now<00:03:59.190> then<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> plate<00:04:00.520> would<00:04:00.760> probably

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
right now then the plate would probably

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.330 
right now then the plate would probably
be<00:04:01.720> good<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.560> only<00:04:02.709> thing<00:04:02.920> other<00:04:03.100> thing<00:04:03.310> that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
be good the only thing other thing that

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.520 
be good the only thing other thing that
I'm<00:04:03.520> worried<00:04:03.820> about<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.330> just<00:04:04.510> north<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
I'm worried about is just north of the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.729 
I'm worried about is just north of the
glowing<00:04:05.830> area<00:04:06.370> or<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.120> really<00:04:07.840> orange<00:04:08.320> area

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
glowing area or the really orange area

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.740 
glowing area or the really orange area
it's<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.489> plate<00:04:09.730> place<00:04:10.270> where<00:04:10.510> it's<00:04:10.630> not

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it's the plate place where it's not

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.699 
it's the plate place where it's not
glowing<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:12.400> orange<00:04:12.820> at<00:04:12.910> all<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:14.350> this<00:04:14.560> is

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
glowing that orange at all and this is

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.199 
glowing that orange at all and this is
just<00:04:14.920> gonna<00:04:15.070> pop<00:04:15.160> your<00:04:15.550> chips<00:04:15.850> it's<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.150> to

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
just gonna pop your chips it's going to

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.020 
just gonna pop your chips it's going to
cause<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.450> lot<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.810> problems<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.820> pretty

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
cause a lot of problems so it's pretty

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.490 
cause a lot of problems so it's pretty
much<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.419> point<00:04:19.600> where<00:04:19.870> we<00:04:20.020> wanted<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.320> go

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
much to the point where we wanted to go

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.260 
much to the point where we wanted to go
ahead<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.770> shut<00:04:20.950> off<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.250> system<00:04:21.459> again<00:04:22.120> this

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
ahead and shut off the system again this

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210 
ahead and shut off the system again this
is<00:04:22.479> just<00:04:22.660> for<00:04:22.870> testing<00:04:23.260> purposes<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.979> never

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
is just for testing purposes you never

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.510 
is just for testing purposes you never
want<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.520> let<00:04:24.700> the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
want to let the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.909 
want to let the
system<00:04:25.970> or<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.539> top<00:04:26.750> plate<00:04:27.050> get<00:04:27.379> that<00:04:27.590> hot

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
system or the top plate get that hot

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.589 
system or the top plate get that hot
when<00:04:28.280> you're<00:04:28.430> running<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.879> profile<00:04:29.360> it

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
when you're running the profile it

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.059 
when you're running the profile it
really<00:04:29.900> shouldn't<00:04:30.199> be<00:04:30.319> getting<00:04:30.440> orange<00:04:30.949> at

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
really shouldn't be getting orange at

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.760 
really shouldn't be getting orange at
all<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:32.360> as<00:04:32.509> we<00:04:32.780> notice<00:04:33.139> when<00:04:33.289> we<00:04:33.410> are<00:04:33.530> running

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
all but as we notice when we are running

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.580 
all but as we notice when we are running
the<00:04:34.009> profiles<00:04:34.460> before<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.900> did<00:04:36.110> start<00:04:36.409> to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
the profiles before that it did start to

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.070 
the profiles before that it did start to
glow<00:04:36.800> orange<00:04:37.539> specifically<00:04:38.539> in<00:04:38.659> that<00:04:38.840> one

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
glow orange specifically in that one

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.450 
glow orange specifically in that one
area<00:04:39.349> and<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.759> plate<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.300> defective<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:43.310> it's

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
area and this plate is defective so it's

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.129 
area and this plate is defective so it's
gonna<00:04:43.580> be<00:04:43.819> neat<00:04:44.060> or<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.479> gonna<00:04:44.599> need<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.900> be

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
gonna be neat or it's gonna need to be
