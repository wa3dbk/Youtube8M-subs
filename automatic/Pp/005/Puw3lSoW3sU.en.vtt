00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
up particles from the bottom of the pool
and<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:08.250> has<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.790> filter<00:01:09.420> bag<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> does

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
is it catches the particles and then it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
is it catches the particles and then it
redistributes<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.580> water<00:01:14.939> throughout<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
redistributes the water throughout the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.010 
redistributes the water throughout the
pool<00:01:16.549> as<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.360> coming<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pool as you can see it's coming up the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.920 
pool as you can see it's coming up the
wall<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.549> we'll<00:01:20.549> take<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> look<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
wall here we'll take a look at it you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.020 
wall here we'll take a look at it you
can<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> sort<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:24.020> foam<00:01:25.020> pad

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
can see it sort of has like a foam pad

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.929 
can see it sort of has like a foam pad
where<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.119> comes<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> wall<00:01:28.430> and

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
where it comes up on the wall and

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.030 
where it comes up on the wall and
scrapes<00:01:31.630> if<00:01:31.930> there's<00:01:32.140> anything<00:01:32.350> algae<00:01:32.920> or

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
scrapes if there's anything algae or

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.730 
scrapes if there's anything algae or
anything<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.670> have<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.210> vinyl<00:01:34.450> liner<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.500> that's

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
anything I have a vinyl liner and that's

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.280 
anything I have a vinyl liner and that's
why<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.580> foam<00:01:36.820> pad<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.390> really<00:01:37.420> good<00:01:37.960> because

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
why the foam pad is really good because

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.830 
why the foam pad is really good because
it<00:01:38.439> it<00:01:38.950> kind<00:01:39.220> of<00:01:39.340> sucks<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.090> stuff<00:01:40.390> right<00:01:40.630> off

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
it it kind of sucks the stuff right off

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
it it kind of sucks the stuff right off
the<00:01:41.940> liner

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.600 

it<00:01:46.030> also<00:01:46.210> helps<00:01:46.659> stir<00:01:46.960> up<00:01:47.170> your<00:01:47.200> chemicals<00:01:47.920> so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it also helps stir up your chemicals so

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.359 
it also helps stir up your chemicals so
if<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.180> add<00:01:49.270> anything<00:01:49.720> like<00:01:50.140> pH<00:01:50.530> up<00:01:50.830> or<00:01:51.100> pH

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
if you add anything like pH up or pH

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.359 
if you add anything like pH up or pH
down<00:01:51.729> or<00:01:52.149> algaecide<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.930> your<00:01:53.049> pool<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
down or algaecide to your pool the

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.240

Aquabot<00:01:54.880> takes<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.479> water<00:01:56.009> sucks<00:01:57.009> it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
Aquabot takes that water sucks it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.779 
Aquabot takes that water sucks it
through<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.940> basically<00:01:59.789> redistributes

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
through it and basically redistributes

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.779 
through it and basically redistributes
that<00:02:01.000> water<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.899> can<00:02:02.229> clean<00:02:02.500> up<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:03.009> six

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
that water it can clean up to six

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.559 
that water it can clean up to six
thousand<00:02:04.450> seven<00:02:04.780> hundred<00:02:05.610> cubic<00:02:06.610> feet<00:02:06.909> per

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
thousand seven hundred cubic feet per

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.180 
thousand seven hundred cubic feet per
gallons<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.289> water<00:02:08.560> per<00:02:08.769> hour<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
gallons of water per hour so it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.190 
gallons of water per hour so it
distributes<00:02:12.190> all<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.580> water<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.050> you

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
distributes all that water and it you

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.960 
distributes all that water and it you
know<00:02:14.290> helps<00:02:14.620> distribute<00:02:14.980> your<00:02:15.220> chemicals<00:02:15.760> as

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
know helps distribute your chemicals as

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.270 
know helps distribute your chemicals as
I<00:02:16.120> said<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:17.880> think<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.000> made<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:19.510> any

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.900 
pull out and I usually clean it just in
a<00:02:43.600> bucket<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.110> water<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> take<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.489> bag<00:02:45.670> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
a bucket of water so I take the bag I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.670 
a bucket of water so I take the bag I
turn<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.239> inside<00:02:46.600> out<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.840> dip<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.470> like<00:02:47.650> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
turn it inside out and dip it in like a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.050 
turn it inside out and dip it in like a
five-gallon<00:02:48.340> bucket<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.760> water<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:51.060> this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
five-gallon bucket of water and this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.099 
five-gallon bucket of water and this
particular<00:02:52.720> cleaner<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:54.000> programmed<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.959> it

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
particular cleaner is programmed so it

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.550 
particular cleaner is programmed so it
kind<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.440> knows<00:02:56.650> where<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.160> going<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:59.170> climbs

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
kind of knows where it's going it climbs

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.520 
kind of knows where it's going it climbs
your<00:02:59.890> wall<00:03:00.130> once<00:03:01.060> every<00:03:01.480> four<00:03:01.750> passes<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.470> know

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
your wall once every four passes I know

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.710 
your wall once every four passes I know
some<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.010> older<00:03:03.370> robots<00:03:03.850> they<00:03:04.120> had<00:03:04.269> issues

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
some of the older robots they had issues

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.240 
some of the older robots they had issues
with<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.200> robots<00:03:07.230> staying<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> walls<00:03:08.890> all

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
with the robots staying on the walls all

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.220 
with the robots staying on the walls all
the<00:03:09.370> time<00:03:09.609> but<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.390> gravity

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
the time but because of gravity

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.490 
the time but because of gravity
most<00:03:12.160> dirt<00:03:12.519> ends<00:03:12.820> up<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.239> bottom<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.320> this

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
most dirt ends up on the bottom so this

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.449 
most dirt ends up on the bottom so this
does<00:03:14.739> four<00:03:15.609> passes<00:03:16.209> across<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.780> bottom<00:03:16.959> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
does four passes across the bottom and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.400 
does four passes across the bottom and
on<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.609> fourth<00:03:18.880> pass<00:03:19.180> it'll<00:03:19.600> climb<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.200> wall

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
on the fourth pass it'll climb the wall

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.949 
on the fourth pass it'll climb the wall
and<00:03:20.799> once<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.640> climbs<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.090> wall<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.540> usually

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
and once it climbs the wall it usually

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.380 
and once it climbs the wall it usually
goes<00:03:23.609> horizontally<00:03:24.609> after<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.060> hits<00:03:25.239> up

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
goes horizontally after it hits up

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.300 
goes horizontally after it hits up
vertically<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.079> top<00:03:26.350> it'll<00:03:26.709> travel

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
vertically to the top it'll travel

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.449 
vertically to the top it'll travel
horizontally<00:03:28.230> across<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> water<00:03:29.799> line<00:03:30.130> and

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
horizontally across the water line and

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.160 
horizontally across the water line and
clean<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.180> area<00:03:31.600> where<00:03:31.810> there<00:03:31.959> might<00:03:32.109> be

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
clean that area where there might be

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:41.270 
clean that area where there might be
some<00:03:32.319> slime<00:03:32.859> or<00:03:33.160> sludge

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.420 

there<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.960> deep<00:03:43.500> end<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:44.130> can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
there is going in the deep end you can

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.580 
there is going in the deep end you can
see<00:03:44.580> kind<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.000> runs<00:03:45.240> on<00:03:45.510> an<00:03:45.660> angle<00:03:46.080> across<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
see kind of runs on an angle across the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.670 
see kind of runs on an angle across the
pool<00:03:47.210> and<00:03:48.210> he<00:03:48.480> gets<00:03:48.690> all<00:03:48.870> those<00:03:49.020> spots<00:03:49.320> that

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
pool and he gets all those spots that

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.470 
pool and he gets all those spots that
are<00:03:49.800> hard<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.190> get<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.940> he<00:03:50.970> really<00:03:51.270> does<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
are hard to get and he really does a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.260 
are hard to get and he really does a
good<00:03:51.720> job<00:03:52.070> originally<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.370> thought<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.670> I

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
good job originally I thought that I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.270 
good job originally I thought that I
would<00:03:54.570> want<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.170> t2<00:03:55.680> because<00:03:55.950> he<00:03:56.160> has

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
would want like the t2 because he has

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.350 
would want like the t2 because he has
those<00:03:56.550> rougher<00:03:57.150> rubber<00:03:57.800> cleaning<00:03:58.800> pads<00:03:59.360> but

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
those rougher rubber cleaning pads but

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.500 
those rougher rubber cleaning pads but
