this<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.530> a<00:00:27.590> starting<00:00:28.130> point<00:00:28.340> for<00:00:28.610> that<00:00:28.760> and

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
this is a starting point for that and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.029 
this is a starting point for that and
that's<00:00:29.150> called<00:00:29.539> check<00:00:29.840> disk<00:00:30.170> or<00:00:30.470> scan<00:00:30.770> disk

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.819 
that's called check disk or scan disk
and<00:00:32.620> you<00:00:33.620> can<00:00:34.070> start<00:00:34.489> it<00:00:34.610> by<00:00:34.820> going<00:00:35.239> to

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
and you can start it by going to

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.280 
and you can start it by going to
properties<00:00:36.829> of<00:00:37.250> your<00:00:37.810> drive<00:00:38.810> that's<00:00:39.020> giving

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
properties of your drive that's giving

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.690 
properties of your drive that's giving
you<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.470> trouble<00:00:39.860> going<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.250> tools<00:00:40.489> and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
you the trouble going to tools and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.960 
you the trouble going to tools and
saying<00:00:41.030> check<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:42.280> but<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.550> problem<00:00:43.700> with

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
saying check now but the problem with

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.030 
saying check now but the problem with
this<00:00:44.090> is<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:44.630> it's<00:00:45.290> only<00:00:45.470> gonna<00:00:45.620> scan<00:00:46.010> a

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
this is that it's only gonna scan a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.410 
this is that it's only gonna scan a
little<00:00:46.370> bit<00:00:46.489> it's<00:00:46.640> not<00:00:46.700> going<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:47.000> go<00:00:47.210> through

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
little bit it's not going to go through

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.940 
little bit it's not going to go through
everything<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.930> really<00:00:48.200> should<00:00:48.470> go<00:00:48.649> through

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
everything it really should go through

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.100 
everything it really should go through
and<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.970> only<00:00:50.120> way<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.300> get<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:50.630> to<00:00:50.720> do<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:50.870> is

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
and the only way to get it to do that is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.840 
and the only way to get it to do that is
to<00:00:51.230> do<00:00:51.380> it<00:00:51.530> before<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.950> computer<00:00:52.309> even<00:00:52.550> starts

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
to do it before the computer even starts

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.750 
to do it before the computer even starts

to<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.529> it<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:03.770> way<00:02:04.159> this<00:02:04.729> one<00:02:04.969> won't<00:02:05.119> we'll

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
to do it this way this one won't we'll

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.410 
to do it this way this one won't we'll
just<00:02:05.689> go<00:02:05.840> through<00:02:05.869> these<00:02:06.169> scans<00:02:06.529> but<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.420> can't

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
just go through these scans but it can't

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.190 
just go through these scans but it can't
do<00:02:08.539> nearly<00:02:08.989> as<00:02:09.080> much<00:02:09.289> as<00:02:09.349> it<00:02:09.530> can<00:02:09.890> get<00:02:10.069> through

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
do nearly as much as it can get through

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.110 
do nearly as much as it can get through
if<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.590> doing<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.040> our<00:02:13.220> boot<00:02:13.430> scanner<00:02:13.790> so

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
if it's doing on our boot scanner so

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.580 
if it's doing on our boot scanner so
this<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.360> where<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.630> would<00:02:14.720> say<00:02:14.960> yes<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
this is where you would say yes and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.370 
this is where you would say yes and
press<00:02:15.980> enter

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
press enter

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.230 
press enter
and<00:02:18.380> then<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.830> here<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.550> recorded<00:02:20.090> with

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
and then this here this is recorded with

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.030 
and then this here this is recorded with
a<00:02:20.270> standard<00:02:20.870> video<00:02:21.020> camera<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.680> excuse<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
a standard video camera so excuse the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.040 
a standard video camera so excuse the
quality<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.660> what<00:02:23.810> you're<00:02:23.960> gonna

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
quality but this is what you're gonna

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.140 
quality but this is what you're gonna
see<00:02:24.350> once<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.860> computer<00:02:25.250> restarts<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:25.940> just

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
see once the computer restarts it's just

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.990 
see once the computer restarts it's just
going<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.560> do<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.680> simple<00:02:28.310> scan<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:28.880> gonna

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
going to do this simple scan it's gonna

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.320 
going to do this simple scan it's gonna
have<00:02:29.150> five<00:02:29.390> steps<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:31.370> will<00:02:31.700> take<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.030> while

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
have five steps and it will take a while

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.940 
have five steps and it will take a while
depending<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.990> size<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.410> your<00:02:33.470> hard<00:02:33.680> drive

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
depending on the size of your hard drive

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.310 
depending on the size of your hard drive
so<00:02:34.370> be<00:02:35.150> prepared<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:35.870> let<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.170> do<00:02:36.290> its

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
so be prepared to just let it do its

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.810 
so be prepared to just let it do its
thing<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.680> walk<00:02:36.980> away<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.460> little<00:02:37.670> while
