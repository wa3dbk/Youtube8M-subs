00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
can show you that i had it set aside i

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.800 
can show you that i had it set aside i
was<00:02:46.610> going<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:46.880> another<00:02:47.060> video<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.480> one

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
was going to do another video that one

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.520 
was going to do another video that one
but<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.220> non<00:02:49.550> hollow<00:02:50.530> Charizard

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
but this is the non hollow Charizard

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.830 
but this is the non hollow Charizard
card<00:02:51.920> from<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> set<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.670> actually<00:02:53.060> number<00:02:53.239> 3

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
card from the set is actually number 3

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.070 
card from the set is actually number 3
of<00:02:54.640> 1-10<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.820> it's<00:02:55.940> basically<00:02:56.120> opposite<00:02:56.989> of

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
of 1-10 so it's basically opposite of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.160 
of 1-10 so it's basically opposite of
what<00:02:57.260> theme<00:02:57.500> decks<00:02:57.739> do<00:02:57.980> nowadays<00:02:58.390> where<00:02:59.390> it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
what theme decks do nowadays where it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.050 
what theme decks do nowadays where it
could<00:03:00.440> be<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.590> regular<00:03:00.830> rare<00:03:01.250> from<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.640> set<00:03:01.850> but

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
could be a regular rare from the set but

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.910 
could be a regular rare from the set but
then<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.360> theme<00:03:02.630> deck<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.140> main<00:03:03.380> card<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
then the theme deck the main card and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.190 
then the theme deck the main card and
that<00:03:04.040> deck<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.550> holographic<00:03:05.239> pattern<00:03:05.780> this

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
that deck is a holographic pattern this

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.610 
that deck is a holographic pattern this
is<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.470> opposite<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:08.410> look<00:03:09.410> at<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
is the opposite if you look at the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.680 
is the opposite if you look at the
legendary<00:03:10.130> collection<00:03:10.459> set<00:03:10.880> number<00:03:11.090> 3<00:03:11.510> of

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
legendary collection set number 3 of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.470 
legendary collection set number 3 of
1-10<00:03:12.260> charizard<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.160> normally<00:03:13.940> hollow<00:03:14.209> but

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
1-10 charizard is normally hollow but

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.360 
1-10 charizard is normally hollow but
like<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.750> said<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.380> one's<00:03:15.650> non<00:03:15.950> hollow

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
like I said this one's non hollow

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.640 
like I said this one's non hollow
because<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.880> came<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.300> theme<00:03:17.570> deck<00:03:17.870> way<00:03:18.620> back

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
because it came the theme deck way back

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.560 
because it came the theme deck way back
when<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.709> hope<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:22.040> enjoyed<00:03:22.370> looking<00:03:23.330> at
