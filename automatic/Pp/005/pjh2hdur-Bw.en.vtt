autofocus where you want to focus and

autofocus where you want to focus and
many<00:00:31.529> more<00:00:31.740> gestures<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.940> sure<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
many more gestures that I'm sure can and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
many more gestures that I'm sure can and
will<00:00:33.930> start<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> few<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> roll<00:00:35.550> out

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
will start out with a few and roll out

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.790 
will start out with a few and roll out
some<00:00:35.880> more<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.300> further<00:00:36.510> updates<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
some more and further updates but is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
some more and further updates but is
definitely<00:00:38.160> pretty<00:00:38.399> cool<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.120> opinion

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
definitely pretty cool but in my opinion

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.479 
definitely pretty cool but in my opinion
from<00:00:40.050> seeing<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.680> camcorders<00:00:41.280> where<00:00:41.430> they

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
from seeing some camcorders where they

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
from seeing some camcorders where they
have<00:00:41.610> touch<00:00:41.790> screens<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
have touch screens and all that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
have touch screens and all that
I<00:00:42.870> feel<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> touch<00:00:43.620> seems<00:00:43.890> pretty<00:00:44.219> flimsy

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
I feel the touch seems pretty flimsy

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610 
I feel the touch seems pretty flimsy
obviously<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.570> haven't<00:00:45.930> personally<00:00:46.260> tried

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
obviously I haven't personally tried

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.560 
obviously I haven't personally tried
this<00:00:46.739> out<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.879> didn't<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this out but what we didn't see how the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
this out but what we didn't see how the
touchscreen<00:00:48.960> works<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.980> actually

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
touchscreen works I think it's actually

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.150 
touchscreen works I think it's actually
pretty<00:00:50.370> cool<00:00:50.550> concept<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.980> can't

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
pretty cool concept and I really can't

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
pretty cool concept and I really can't
wait<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.430> try<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:54.079> another<00:00:55.079> major<00:00:55.530> feature

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
wait to try it out another major feature

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
wait to try it out another major feature
of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> Canon<00:00:56.699> t4i<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.449> knife<00:00:57.600> with

autofocus phase and contract detection
contrast<00:01:01.079> detection<00:01:01.289> where<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> uses<00:01:02.550> two

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
contrast detection where it uses two

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
contrast detection where it uses two
different<00:01:02.850> things<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.690> dictate<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
different things to dictate the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.730 
different things to dictate the
autofocus<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.810> get<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.960> best<00:01:07.049> focus<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
autofocus and get you the best focus so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
autofocus and get you the best focus so
this<00:01:08.040> definitely<00:01:08.400> improvement<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.030> Mike

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
this definitely improvement because Mike

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140 
this definitely improvement because Mike
III<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> worked<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:10.860> very<00:01:10.950> well<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.580> loved<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
III I worked very very well I loved it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
III I worked very very well I loved it
but<00:01:12.479> focus<00:01:13.080> sometimes<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:14.100> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
but focus sometimes is a little bit of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
but focus sometimes is a little bit of
an<00:01:14.250> issue<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.180> most<00:01:15.479> people<00:01:15.780> would<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.020> using

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
an issue but most people would be using

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
an issue but most people would be using
manual<00:01:16.590> focus<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.780> line<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
manual focus for this as this line is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and photo quality I'm mainly aiming at

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.020 
and photo quality I'm mainly aiming at
simplicity<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.720> does<00:01:27.930> also<00:01:28.110> have

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
simplicity this does also have

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.289 
simplicity this does also have

continuous autofocus in video mode this

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630

pancakes Outlands that we saw in some
Sony's<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.140> such<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.650> they<00:02:18.130> are<00:02:18.250> also

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
Sony's and such and they are also

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.200 
Sony's and such and they are also

that<00:02:22.660> will<00:02:23.200> also<00:02:23.590> feature<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.300> stepping

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
that will also feature the stepping

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.290 
that will also feature the stepping
motor<00:02:25.330> mechanism<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.490> will<00:02:27.700> come<00:02:27.910> out<00:02:28.060> at
