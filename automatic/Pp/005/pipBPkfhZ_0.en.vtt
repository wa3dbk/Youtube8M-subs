00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hi all last week to you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.750
 see primer's shoplog and in that 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 Shoplog all that is a skater dress 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.259
 bought those gray with black sleeves 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.859
 for 3 euros and in a so requested 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.810
 if I could style these in a movie 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.119
 so in this video I have three 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.880
 different ways how I dress that 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.090
 could wear and let you go 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.090
 look 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.880
 this is the first and I think it is 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.210
 the toughest cars of the three and this one 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.340
 outfit is very suitable for when you 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.309
 go to appointment by one not too 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.110
 simple look then you do it had good 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.110
 at the bottom and then you are ready to go 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.270
 passes have opted for this 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.490
 silver necklace from h &amp; m and i love it 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 silver jewelry and more beautiful match 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.270
 shades of gray 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.399
 my jacket has very nice leather sleeves 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.549
 and therefore not really a bother 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.799
 and in the front is kind of 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.250
 neck roll mission to minutes things 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.890
 and my shoes are the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.289
 name makes jeffrey campbell in 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.899
 be well known and you will stay in you 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.459
 shop gracefully be bought and I think 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.459
 also very tough pick-up 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.300
 I would always go to Christmas Eve this way 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.570
 to do with family or friends 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.460
 that doesn't matter to me that much 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.770
 this car that finds the dress you like there 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.000
 really no longer looks simple but that 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.360
 it really is a chic dress 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 become 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.110
 I chose to light her up 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.270

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.319
