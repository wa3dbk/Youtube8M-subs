00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.189
 a cloud that is quite characteristic 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.250
 of our summer is the way to sausage our 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.799
 summer muse the staff accumulates buses is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.289
 a cloud associated with storms and she 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.779
 is present almost there late 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 all year is more in the summer is more 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.430
 common to see clouds of type c b 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 cumulonimbus clouds on account of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 the strong heat and presence of moisture 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
 in the cloudless air that is formed and with 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.450
 based on approximately two kilometers 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 with respect to the surface and top of it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.700
 staff can reach up to 12 up to 15 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 kilometers in relation to the surface 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.530
 it's a competitive cloud. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.170
 means personal means that people 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.239
 has upward air currents that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
 leading to surface moisture 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.039
 regions of the atmosphere and will 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.320
 condensed there all this moisture 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.660
 favoring the formation of very 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.359
 very thick clouds 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.239
 very large with very high tops is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.700
 this is accumulation ingo is how books is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.619
 the cloud associated with the storms you 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 look inside the community 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 you will see ice even because the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.860
 temperatures as you go up 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.360
 in the atmosphere they are getting 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.369
 lower 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 and then you have the freeze of that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.750
 unit that is present in the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.090
 surface is going up it ends 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.409
 freezing and forming the game there and there 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 when we have the formation of loads 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.490
 we have the thunderbolt here. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.799
 is also represented in this scheme 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.170
 People can see the lightning here too, right? 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.840
 so be careful because despite the cb 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 be our summer muse cb too 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.850
 is associated with a condition of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.549
 very extreme time is the cloud that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 can generate tornados the then is the cloud 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.939
 but is somewhat dangerous in the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.909
 atmosphere the presence of our n series 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.470
 which is the level of condensation by 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.320
 where it is the basis of my 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.600
 cloud giving approximately 800 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.119
 hector pascais 800 hector pascals 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.399
 represents approximately two 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.860
 kilometers in relation to the surface 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.560
 and then we have this blue curve 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.989
 crossing this black curve 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.500
 approximately 330 hctor pascals 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.870
 that I want 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.060
 call meteorology what level of loss 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.120
 push're my n p 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.190
 and is represented by this acronym 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.540
 level of impulse loss so high and 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.820
 This means that we have the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.220
 formation of a large cloud this 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.880
 means that we have the formation of 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.880
 to receive
