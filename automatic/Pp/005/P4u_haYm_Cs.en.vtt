00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.369
 preparation of dough we start with the fact that we 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.840
 become butter 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.540
 from the fridge so she is strong 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.270
 soaked now the shape of the bread machine 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.150
 pour the milk measuring cup 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.810
 break an egg and pour water so that 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.540
 Mrs. Simpson's total fluid was 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.500
 equals one cup so add 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.830
 milk and four more cups of water 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.830
 valyu 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.210
 now dry ingredients flour salt sugar 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.000
 top butter and yeast style 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.850
 for in the first aid kit and after an hour 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.670
 we are ready dough in the meantime 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.580
 filling her for the butter too 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.299
 deliver it should be enough 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.339
 soft for mixing we combine butter 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.070
 sugar to face and mix 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.010
 raisin is not necessary to add as well 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.250
 prepare the icing 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.680
 again softened butter 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.560
 mix with powdered sugar and vanilla 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.390
 sugar and milk stir and set 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.990
 warm place on about basking 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.939
 oven dough ready divide it into 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.729
 two parts will work with them by 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.070
 queue first 1 then sata half 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.859
 dough roll a rectangle thick 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.700
 about half a centimeter half filling 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.850
 well distributed over the surface and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.880
 half 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.490
 raisin, too, now we scatter 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.020
 twist the roll on the long side 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.399
 it's not easy to start next 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.939
 curls much easier 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.950
 roll nato protecting him slightly red 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.049
 when baking buns did not unfold 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.020
 better to pass on parchment now 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.350
 so as not to smear the whole table we cut 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.600
 roll on such stumps about three 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.720
 centimeter thick and bake in the oven 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.770
 at 180 degrees 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.900
 25-30 minutes buns in no reason cut 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.910
 glaze that has become homogeneous and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.910
 all our beer and tasty buns are ready for
