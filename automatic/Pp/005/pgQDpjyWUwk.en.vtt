friends<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.660> kind<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.870> thing

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 

yeah<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:22.230> we're<00:00:22.530> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
yeah so one of the I think we're the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.260 
yeah so one of the I think we're the
difference<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> Nano<00:00:23.610> versus<00:00:24.150> some

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
difference is with the Nano versus some

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.260 
difference is with the Nano versus some
of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.360> big<00:00:24.540> commercial<00:00:26.060> fur<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:29.120> it's<00:00:30.120> all

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
of the big commercial fur is it's all

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.190 
of the big commercial fur is it's all
the<00:00:30.420> same<00:00:30.600> process<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.350> in<00:00:31.520> in<00:00:32.520> most<00:00:32.790> regards

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
the same process and in in most regards

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.330 
the same process and in in most regards
it's<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> Nano<00:00:34.770> everything<00:00:35.220> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it's just with the Nano everything is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.960 
it's just with the Nano everything is
just<00:00:35.490> a<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.970> bit<00:00:36.090> more<00:00:36.239> manual<00:00:37.970> although

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
just a little bit more manual although

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.190 
just a little bit more manual although
these<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.150> much<00:00:39.330> larger<00:00:39.570> than<00:00:39.809> most<00:00:40.050> home

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
these are much larger than most home

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
these are much larger than most home
brewers<00:00:40.500> would<00:00:40.650> use<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:41.640> helper

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
brewers would use this is helper

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.460 
brewers would use this is helper
equipment<00:00:42.420> absolutely<00:00:42.900> it's<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.080> taking

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
equipment absolutely it's just taking

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.170 
equipment absolutely it's just taking
home<00:00:43.620> brew<00:00:43.770> equipment<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.340> doing<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
home brew equipment and doing it kind of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.930 
home brew equipment and doing it kind of
a<00:00:45.239> production<00:00:45.390> mindset<00:00:46.110> basically<00:00:46.650> I<00:00:46.940> really

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
a production mindset basically I really

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.160 
a production mindset basically I really
enjoyed<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.629> most<00:00:48.750> important

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.630 
enjoyed it which is the most important
thing<00:00:49.290> if<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.830> beer<00:00:50.040> it's<00:00:50.489> not

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
thing if I don't like the beer it's not

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
thing if I don't like the beer it's not
something<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> drink<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.170> it

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
just remained a dream kind of in my mind

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.749 
just remained a dream kind of in my mind
and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:06.660> March<00:01:06.899> of<00:01:07.110> last<00:01:07.229> year<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.580> laid

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759

off from my job and that's kind of was

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.749 
off from my job and that's kind of was
the<00:01:10.710> catalyst<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.190> this<00:01:11.310> whole<00:01:11.520> thing

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
the catalyst for this whole thing

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.300 
the catalyst for this whole thing
my<00:01:12.360> sat<00:01:12.540> talked<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:12.960> my<00:01:13.050> wife<00:01:13.259> about<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
my sat talked with my wife about the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.730

whole thing what are we gonna do and she
kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> threw<00:01:17.160> out<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> idea<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> maybe

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
kind of threw out the idea of maybe

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
kind of threw out the idea of maybe
exploring<00:01:18.660> this<00:01:18.840> brewery<00:01:19.080> idea<00:01:19.500> again<00:01:19.880> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
exploring this brewery idea again we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
exploring this brewery idea again we
decided<00:01:21.300> on<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.380> found<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> space

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
decided on that and I found the space

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.410 
decided on that and I found the space
that<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.220> located<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.700> right<00:01:23.880> now

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that I'm located in right now

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.630 
that I'm located in right now
two<00:01:24.870> days<00:01:25.020> later<00:01:25.049> signed<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> lease<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
two days later signed a lease and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.980 
two days later signed a lease and
everything<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.120> went<00:01:27.270> warp<00:01:27.540> speed<00:01:27.810> from

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
everything just went warp speed from

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
everything just went warp speed from
that<00:01:28.080> moment<00:01:28.260> on<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.640> side<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that moment on the side of the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
that moment on the side of the
disadvantages<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.560> I've<00:01:31.620> talked<00:01:31.830> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
disadvantages that and I've talked to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.680 
disadvantages that and I've talked to
some<00:01:32.040> other<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.880> smaller<00:01:33.150> guys<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.540> town

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
some other of the smaller guys in town

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.140 
some other of the smaller guys in town
as<00:01:33.870> well<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.140> other<00:01:34.260> nanos<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.920> having<00:01:35.880> such<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
as well as other nanos is having such a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.630 
as well as other nanos is having such a
short<00:01:36.479> supply<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> beer<00:01:37.320> I'm<00:01:38.159> constantly

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
short supply of beer I'm constantly
