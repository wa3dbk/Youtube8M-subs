i'm<00:00:03.990> going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.259> show<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.410> what<00:00:04.740> an<00:00:04.830> array<00:00:05.040> is

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
i'm going to show you what an array is

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.579 
i'm going to show you what an array is
how<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> load<00:00:06.270> data<00:00:06.420> into<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.990> how<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.379> take

to load in the XML in the flash we need

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.690 
to load in the XML in the flash we need
to<00:00:31.779> understand<00:00:32.230> what<00:00:32.680> an<00:00:32.770> array<00:00:32.980> is<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.489> how

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
to understand what an array is and how

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.049 
to understand what an array is and how
to<00:00:33.760> use<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.620> unlike<00:00:35.620> basic<00:00:36.040> variables<00:00:36.550> arrays

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
to use it unlike basic variables arrays

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.410 
to use it unlike basic variables arrays
can<00:00:37.270> hold<00:00:37.480> multiple<00:00:37.930> values<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.790> example<00:00:40.239> I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
can hold multiple values for example I

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.900 
can hold multiple values for example I
want<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.080> make<00:00:41.170> a<00:00:41.199> grocery<00:00:41.470> list<00:00:41.650> if<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.670> were<00:00:42.820> to

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
want to make a grocery list if I were to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.460 
want to make a grocery list if I were to
use<00:00:43.059> string<00:00:43.480> variables<00:00:43.989> i<00:00:44.170> would<00:00:44.290> have<00:00:44.410> to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
use string variables i would have to

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.410 
use string variables i would have to
create<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:44.980> knew<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.430> unique<00:00:45.699> variable<00:00:46.210> each

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
create you knew a unique variable each

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.900 
create you knew a unique variable each
time<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:48.100> would<00:00:48.250> look<00:00:48.370> something<00:00:48.550> like<00:00:48.790> this

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
time it would look something like this

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.810 
time it would look something like this
and<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.800> i<00:00:50.890> were<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.100> trace<00:00:51.370> any<00:00:51.580> of<00:00:51.699> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
and if i were to trace any of the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.369 
and if i were to trace any of the
variables<00:00:52.269> i<00:00:52.449> would<00:00:52.600> get<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:52.809> value<00:00:53.140> of<00:00:53.260> that

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
variables i would get the value of that

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.549 
variables i would get the value of that
string<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:53.920> my<00:00:54.129> output<00:00:54.489> panel<00:00:55.080> but<00:00:56.080> arrays<00:00:56.320> on

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
string and my output panel but arrays on

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.500 
string and my output panel but arrays on
the<00:00:56.650> other<00:00:56.769> hand<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.760> can<00:00:57.970> add<00:00:58.210> multiple

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
the other hand you can add multiple

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.020 
the other hand you can add multiple
values<00:00:58.900> and<00:00:59.409> access<00:00:59.949> them<00:01:00.129> by<00:01:00.370> going<00:01:00.729> to<00:01:01.000> a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
values and access them by going to a

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.649 
values and access them by going to a
specific<00:01:01.330> index<00:01:02.229> of<00:01:02.470> that<00:01:02.680> array<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:04.239> example

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
specific index of that array for example

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.560 
specific index of that array for example
i<00:01:04.839> will<00:01:04.930> set<00:01:05.260> up<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.470> ray<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.680> groceries<00:01:06.280> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
i will set up a ray of groceries and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.060 
i will set up a ray of groceries and
fill<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.690> with<00:01:07.810> multiple<00:01:08.200> values<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.770> then

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
fill it with multiple values and then

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.440 
fill it with multiple values and then
call<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> specific<00:01:09.940> value<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.299> i<00:01:13.330> am

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
call a specific value so here i am

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.180 
call a specific value so here i am
starting<00:01:13.930> out<00:01:14.020> with<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.229> VAR<00:01:14.470> keyword<00:01:14.500> and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190

type<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.310> array<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.110> equal

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
type in it to array and then I equal

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.520 
type in it to array and then I equal
that<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.860> new<00:01:21.159> array<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:23.110> right<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.409> the

values to our array now I want to get to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.779 
values to our array now I want to get to
the<00:01:28.509> first<00:01:28.810> value<00:01:29.079> of<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.469> array<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.310> i<00:01:30.340> trace

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
the first value of that array so i trace

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.510 
the first value of that array so i trace
my<00:01:31.090> array<00:01:31.509> with<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.810> index<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.350> 0<00:01:32.619> be<00:01:33.310> sure

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
my array with the index of 0 be sure

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.420 
my array with the index of 0 be sure
that<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.820> index<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.359> in<00:01:34.509> square<00:01:34.780> brackets

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that the index is in square brackets

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.649 
that the index is in square brackets
notice<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.609> upper<00:01:36.640> panel<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.390> see<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
notice in the upper panel you see the

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.370 
notice in the upper panel you see the
results<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.170> my<00:01:38.289> tray<00:01:38.500> stands<00:01:39.899> array<00:01:40.899> starts

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
results of my tray stands array starts

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.190 
results of my tray stands array starts
count<00:01:41.770> from<00:01:42.070> 0<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:43.210> if<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:43.509> have<00:01:43.659> three<00:01:43.990> items

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
count from 0 so if you have three items

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.160 
count from 0 so if you have three items
in<00:01:44.530> your<00:01:44.560> array<00:01:44.950> then<00:01:45.820> your<00:01:46.329> third<00:01:46.359> items

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
in your array then your third items

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.279 
in your array then your third items
index<00:01:47.649> is<00:01:47.950> 2<00:01:48.429> meaning<00:01:49.149> item<00:01:49.570> one<00:01:49.750> has<00:01:49.899> an<00:01:50.049> index

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
index is 2 meaning item one has an index

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.099 
index is 2 meaning item one has an index
is<00:01:50.500> 0<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.070> an<00:01:51.490> item<00:01:51.820> 2<00:01:52.060> has<00:01:52.299> an<00:01:52.450> index<00:01:52.689> of<00:01:52.840> one

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
is 0 and an item 2 has an index of one

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.249 
is 0 and an item 2 has an index of one
and<00:01:53.429> item<00:01:54.429> 3<00:01:54.700> has<00:01:54.820> an<00:01:54.939> index<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.359> 2<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.749> so<00:01:56.229> on

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
and item 3 has an index of 2 and so on

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.099 
and item 3 has an index of 2 and so on
moving<00:01:57.189> on<00:01:57.310> as<00:01:57.520> your<00:01:57.880> shopping<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.689> realize
