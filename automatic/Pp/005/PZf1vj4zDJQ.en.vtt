00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
now we had the 50 k pi chains we did

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.089 
now we had the 50 k pi chains we did
already<00:00:08.490> right<00:00:09.000> then<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.960> last<00:00:10.170> one<00:00:10.530> see<00:00:10.950> if

you see the neighbor one he had see just

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.760 
you see the neighbor one he had see just
to<00:00:15.870> take<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:17.720> just<00:00:18.720> loosen<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.560> one

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
to take this one just loosen this one

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.099 
to take this one just loosen this one
like<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:21.350> just<00:00:22.350> loosen<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.390> then

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
like that just loosen this this one then

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.790 
like that just loosen this this one then
it<00:00:26.010> must<00:00:26.310> go<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.449> last<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:28.080> okay<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.619> last

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
it must go the last one okay the last

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
it must go the last one okay the last
two<00:00:29.189> upward<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.260> see<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.500> Phi<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.279> did<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> 1<00:00:33.000> 2

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
two upward one see the Phi we did it 1 2

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.920 
two upward one see the Phi we did it 1 2
3<00:00:33.329> 4<00:00:33.930> 5<00:00:34.230> v<00:00:34.559> today<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.640> last<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.329> will<00:00:36.630> go

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
3 4 5 v today the last one will go

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
3 4 5 v today the last one will go
upward<00:00:37.770> direction<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.090> downward

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
upward direction not the downward

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.280 
upward direction not the downward
direction<00:00:39.649> it<00:00:40.649> must<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.290> upward

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
direction it must go the upward

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.420 
direction it must go the upward
direction<00:00:43.800> okay<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.660> must<00:00:45.930> come<00:00:46.430> inside

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
direction okay then it must come inside

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.410 
direction okay then it must come inside
the<00:00:47.700> same<00:00:48.000> loop<00:00:48.500> see<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.219> coming<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:51.149> let

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the same loop see this coming down let

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.490 
the same loop see this coming down let
understand<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.030> last<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:55.140> go

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
understand this one the the last one go

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.709 
understand this one the the last one go
upward<00:00:58.500> direction<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.640> comes<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:01.010> okay

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
upward direction then comes out okay

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.750 
upward direction then comes out okay
that's<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.040> see<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.339> appalling<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.760> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that's it see just appalling now just it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.899 
that's it see just appalling now just it
you<00:01:08.970> must<00:01:09.270> hear<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> sound<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> tick<00:01:10.909> then

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you must hear the sound like a tick then

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.060 
you must hear the sound like a tick then
only<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.510> will<00:01:12.540> form<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.890> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
only it will form like this one see it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.210 
only it will form like this one see it
will<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.729> come<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:16.220> t

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
will it will come like this one t

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.539 
will it will come like this one t
understand<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.680> okay<00:01:19.680> i<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.220> repeat

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
understand this one okay i will repeat

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
understand this one okay i will repeat
you<00:01:20.729> again<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.900> last<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.540> last<00:01:24.570> loop

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you again the last one the last loop

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
you again the last one the last loop
little<00:01:25.680> bit<00:01:25.799> make<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.640> looser

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
little bit make it a little bit looser

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.640 
little bit make it a little bit looser
the<00:01:27.840> last<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:30.079> see<00:01:31.079> upper

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the last one go in there see upper

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.280 
the last one go in there see upper
direction<00:01:32.180> last<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> upward

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
direction last one go in the upward

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.940 
direction last one go in the upward
direction<00:01:35.060> see<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.540> upper<00:01:36.810> direction<00:01:37.049> then

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
direction see the upper direction then

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.480 
direction see the upper direction then
it<00:01:38.130> come<00:01:38.720> inside<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.979> generous

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it come inside like that then generous

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060 
it come inside like that then generous
to<00:01:41.700> pull<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.899> automatically<00:01:43.619> turn

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to pull it it will automatically turn

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
to pull it it will automatically turn
around<00:01:44.520> okay<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> bender<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> Sun

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
around okay like a bender like the Sun

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.660 
around okay like a bender like the Sun
see<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.390> then

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
see it will be like that then

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.710 
see it will be like that then
automatically<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.000> Bend<00:01:51.420> like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
automatically it will Bend like

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.760 
automatically it will Bend like
Henderson<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.670> cut<00:01:54.439> okay<00:01:55.439> six

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
Henderson this one now we cut okay six

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.139 
Henderson this one now we cut okay six
strands<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:58.219> this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> basics

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
strands like this one this is the basics

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.230 
strands like this one this is the basics
of<00:02:00.270> disc<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:03.350> okay<00:02:04.460> see<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:05.640> six

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
of disc we are going to okay see now six
