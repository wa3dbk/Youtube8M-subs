00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.590
 when again two new lamps left home Barca 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 the clothes and 05 counters 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.839
 and the new alcohol 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.159
 the basic providers 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.970
 1 no 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.919
 so 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 Companies the new subway 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.300
 ST550 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.419
 CW Colbert 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.730
 I only found the toolbar on offer at the end of November 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.289
 the Natural 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.439
 Waldhuber like that so that no one wants to have more because of it 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.500
 be with her 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
 in the shop 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.090
 very official 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.350
 is either earlier 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.820
 one allowed him 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 normal but real 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.990
 or 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.000
 for a lithium-ion battery with EUR 7 everyone wanted but acutely 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 but I want to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.940
 to point out that it makes no sense 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.110
 the rental income 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 8 percent 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 Lithium ion batteries to Wallis Union AGU too 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.040
 all this clearly shows a clearer minus 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.890
 are with 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.580
 the sky is OK the highest 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 we not only look great we are so much weaker 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.540
 Solis was 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.000
 coming 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 4 invest 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.960
 this headband 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.109
 it came to the agreed and can imagine 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.510
 Forum 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.330
 a young opera 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 unlike the big laugh 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.360
 has to be at the small lamp 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.360
 the positive pole platform 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.039
 Pictures set 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.389
 Hangs on the bad tree-donor 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.389
 We want to see Porsche 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.319
 Neuhaus 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.689
 once again saved the last track 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.149
 we are fine 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.739
 mid / sta with Euro 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.689
 we enter with their high 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.380
 So when you stop 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.380
 they are going through 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.269
 the technical data 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.799
 preferably 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.340
 from the currently in the endemic exciting so much to say so had to 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.189
 handle 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.129
 and we have to imagine her size 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.789
 that here could give it a tighter his stand 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.189
 Wangerooge - Media is perhaps something is also running so well 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.829
 something else in between 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.599
 then you would have to wear a bit heavy because they sparkle from 9 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.609
 Paris may have experience with but if from XP the 5 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.059
 and nice for button 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.310
 we really should only handle neatly processed clutches Norbert 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.500
