00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
pretty much let's get into the first one

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
pretty much let's get into the first one
so<00:00:57.629> first<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.410> lord<00:00:58.829> nicklas

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so first up we have a lord nicklas

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
so first up we have a lord nicklas
bendtner<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.570> he<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:01.440> probably<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
bendtner now he will probably be a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
bendtner now he will probably be a
silver<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:02.730> he<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> gold<00:01:03.510> 75<00:01:04.049> last

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
silver because he was a gold 75 last

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219 
silver because he was a gold 75 last
year<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> again<00:01:05.729> he's<00:01:05.909> done<00:01:06.119> nothing<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.900> i

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
year and again he's done nothing and i

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.719 
year and again he's done nothing and i
think<00:01:07.470> you'll<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> silver<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
think you'll go down to a silver and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.480 
think you'll go down to a silver and
he'll<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.420> okay<00:01:10.020> i<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> silver<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
he'll be okay i think as a silver this

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
he'll be okay i think as a silver this
was<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.790> idea<00:01:11.850> no<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.479> said<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.689> off<00:01:12.930> twitter

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
was my idea no one said this off twitter

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
was my idea no one said this off twitter
this<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.240> reason<00:01:15.390> he'll<00:01:15.689> be

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this was my one and the reason he'll be

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.420 
this was my one and the reason he'll be
0<00:01:15.810> pitch<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.380> he<00:01:16.470> still<00:01:16.680> bust<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> players

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
0 pitch because he still bust so players

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
0 pitch because he still bust so players
that<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:17.970> silver<00:01:18.360> often<00:01:18.840> performed<00:01:19.200> better

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that are silver often performed better

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
that are silver often performed better
because<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> handicap<00:01:20.220> stuff<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.610> i'm

he's quite six foot tall he's gonna have

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.139 
he's quite six foot tall he's gonna have
like<00:02:00.899> 88<00:02:01.320> 89<00:02:01.710> pace<00:02:02.159> i<00:02:02.369> think<00:02:02.640> he'll<00:02:02.820> also<00:02:03.000> be

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
like 88 89 pace i think he'll also be

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.270 
like 88 89 pace i think he'll also be
very<00:02:03.420> cheap<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.960> he'll<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.140> low<00:02:04.380> rated<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
very cheap as he'll be low rated for a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740 
very cheap as he'll be low rated for a
fullback<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.060> finally<00:02:06.270> he'll<00:02:06.570> have

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
fullback and then finally he'll have

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
fullback and then finally he'll have
good<00:02:06.930> crossing<00:02:07.409> i<00:02:07.469> think<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:07.829> he<00:02:07.860> has

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
good crossing i think because he has

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.260 
good crossing i think because he has
really<00:02:08.280> good<00:02:08.369> crossing<00:02:08.729> real<00:02:08.910> life<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really good crossing real life and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
really good crossing real life and
hopefully<00:02:09.780> has<00:02:10.020> good<00:02:10.200> crossing<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.619> game

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
hopefully has good crossing in the game

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.050 
hopefully has good crossing in the game
so<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.400> those<00:02:11.489> crossed<00:02:11.819> in
