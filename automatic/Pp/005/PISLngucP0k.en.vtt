00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.200
 i 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.610
 i 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.890
 hi people I am that believes you but also 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.539
 known as the one who also uploads videos 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.310
 at night and today I teach you something 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.400
 It's really cool I discovered it 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.140
 now after a few tries and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.090
 the truth then it is a wonder about 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.969
 everything for the people who use the rest neither 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.250
 such because it is a much more clock 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:36.579
 1.7 accelerated some may already 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.399
 they knew but the good thing is that I've 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.670
 been investigating I have not found 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.680
 these guys 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.990
 basically this on the right as you see 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.370
 that 's where by cocoon 4 that's 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.140
 we have collaborated that I have created that by 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.630
 true tomorrow about a video I describe is 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 very interesting and good there is a 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.260
 numbering not as of now when 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.600
 put a block here they're going to start 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.640
 raise points but set the speed to 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.770
 the one that raises points you are prepared a 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.050
 two 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:10.050
 fix you fix right area to look like 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.240
 upload this speed is crazy 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.850
 Well, this is what I discovered 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.210
 and then I said let's see this this is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.820
 something very slow the mythical hopper is not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.760
 super slow because if you see yourself there in the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.430
 corner then put what the hell puts wave 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.780
 in the good chat in the corner puts 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.730
 13-14 but as you see 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.100
 the speed is very very slow then 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.890
 it wanted to investigate whether there was 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.960
 a higher speed does not stop especially 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.100
 for score board and I discovered a 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.550
 pretty good speed guys 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550
 fix 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.189
 you have stung is static look 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.049
 what speed guys you look at the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.729
 counter I'm going to reset it to another 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.189
 once there is zero 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.679
 set is perfect this to do the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.750
 test by and to do then the 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.240
 scoring recognition of points of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.039
 everything you want is super fundamental 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.810
 and good as I have done this I am not going to 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.610
 teach first as I have done that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.739
 it's just putting less blog set 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.319
 one or be good with a symbol this 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.599
 minus one and putting minecraft management 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.209
 blog but it destroys and it is worth destroying it 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.920
 the command and then here I made a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.319
 score board that is this player that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.730
 steal cocoon one that adds one here 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.079
 support 4 that is the goal that I created 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.060
 well this I will explain to you tomorrow in the 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.220
 video tomorrow but this is much more 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.780
 simple first I put here as what 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.560
 you are watching a repeat and here I have put 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.930
 to go no 2 - 2 air or is there that what 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.690
 transform into air and here what 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.849
 transform in the crestÃ³n block not in 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.250
 four away is to say two 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.440
 three four there is and good as you see 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 the speed is perfect or it seems to me 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.410
 super perfect this speed to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.819
 detect any kind of things 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.069
 very much better than anybody 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.159
 another little thing but well still I stay 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.260
 with this one the truth is very cool and 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.829
 good guys now what I've done 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.629
 this has been this, I'm going to reset 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.849
 this and what I have put here is a 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.680
 treasure with some coordinates is worth a 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.349
 radius of 1 that the coordinates is that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.500
 point in red that's there is worth this is 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.639
 the cane we are going to put here me only 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.989
 give me the light 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.989
 I'm going to do this, "he said." 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.069
 still and still it 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.620
 let's activate this and therefore this 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.390
 is deactivated from here vale we are going to 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.790
 activate this and you will see what to set the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.829
 chat is okay but I'm going to put this team 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.629
 that I did not know how to fix just when he arrived 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.409
 the red dot the speed it takes 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:46.280
 in writing me that 12 you see or is it 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.560
 super effective that plan has got one 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.599
 it has absolutely nothing good at all 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.099
 this is with this but good this and let's go 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.900
 to see this one to see how we are going to copy 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.860
 this from here 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.829
 so he copied it here and I put it here 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.540
 it's perfect there and now I'm going to put 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:09.079
 this like this this way 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.569
 It's worth 61 here to see how effective it is 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.209
 from iu but nothing happens nothing happens 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.310
 it's equal to it's just as effective as 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.669
 this is what is crazy this Wednesday 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.639
 before the one that leaves before clear that if 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.100
 the quiet one comes out a lot before it is 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.990
 much more effective this here but still 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.110
 so I hope you've been interested in this 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.910
 this tutorial 1.7 country do not go to 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.919
 forget the link in the maps of 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.380
 adventures is the whole thing the truth is going 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.699
 to be a lujazo of that for me nobody that 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.310
 I hope you liked this mini 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.740
 video and I say goodbye here looks 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.380
 this bus and I say goodbye here and tomorrow 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.419
 you have a small tutorial of writing is 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.889
 that is very cool and good guys to give 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.389
 to like if you think this is going to be 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.800
 revolution of the watches of the 1.7 and 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.070
 nothing we see in the next video of 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.470
 whatever is 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.430
 not only from the has and you what 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:06.400
 wants to believe and peace
