00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:09.470 

action<00:00:06.740> so<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> gerber<00:00:08.400> flick<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.179> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
action so this is a gerber flick this is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690 
action so this is a gerber flick this is
the<00:00:09.660> ballistic<00:00:10.260> nylon<00:00:10.500> case<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.280> comes<00:00:11.519> in

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
the ballistic nylon case it comes in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.400 
the ballistic nylon case it comes in
pretty<00:00:12.690> sturdy

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.200 

so<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> Gerber<00:00:19.859> flip<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.279> pretty<00:00:20.699> compact

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
so the Gerber flip is pretty compact

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.179 
so the Gerber flip is pretty compact
however<00:00:21.779> yeah<00:00:22.170> pretty<00:00:22.619> heavy

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
however yeah pretty heavy

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.599 
however yeah pretty heavy
there's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> lot<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:26.130> push<00:00:26.400> up

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
there's a lot going on here you push up

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.380 
there's a lot going on here you push up
on<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:26.910> two<00:00:27.150> plastic<00:00:27.449> tabs<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.349> both<00:00:28.710> sides

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
on these two plastic tabs on both sides

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.330 
on these two plastic tabs on both sides
and<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> closed<00:00:31.890> plier<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.329> as

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
and you get the closed plier with you as

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
and you get the closed plier with you as
you<00:00:35.340> push<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> open<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:36.930> clicks<00:00:37.260> on

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
you push it open here two clicks on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.209 
you push it open here two clicks on
either<00:00:37.920> side<00:00:41.719> like<00:00:42.719> you'd<00:00:42.960> expect<00:00:43.079> any<00:00:43.500> multi

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
either side like you'd expect any multi

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.420 
either side like you'd expect any multi
tu<00:00:44.460> plier<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> look<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.800> you've<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
tu plier to look like you've got the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.319 
tu plier to look like you've got the
point<00:00:47.670> itself<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.460> whatever<00:00:50.460> Ridge<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
point itself and whatever Ridge there is

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
point itself and whatever Ridge there is
there<00:00:51.600> plus<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> wire<00:00:52.620> cutters<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.949> you'll

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there plus the wire cutters and you'll

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.110 
there plus the wire cutters and you'll
notice<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:58.399> there<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> gap

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
notice that as you there there was a gap

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.689 
notice that as you there there was a gap
that<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.770> squeeze<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that you can actually squeeze in it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.280 
that you can actually squeeze in it
doesn't<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.149> go<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> way<00:01:03.989> back

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
doesn't actually go all the way back

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
doesn't actually go all the way back
down<00:01:04.559> you'd<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> push<00:01:06.030> these

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
down you'd actually have to push these

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.660 
down you'd actually have to push these
buttons<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.990> either<00:01:07.290> side<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> multiplier

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
buttons on either side of the multiplier

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
buttons on either side of the multiplier
for<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> compress<00:01:11.270> back<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.080> original

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
for it to compress back to the original

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.460 
for it to compress back to the original
state<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.189> comes<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:18.439> unlike<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
state in which it comes out of unlike a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
state in which it comes out of unlike a
lot<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> Gerber<00:01:20.159> multi<00:01:20.460> tools<00:01:20.670> you'll

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
lot of the Gerber multi tools you'll

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
lot of the Gerber multi tools you'll
notice<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> tools<00:01:22.650> instead<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
notice that all the tools instead of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
notice that all the tools instead of
being<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> inside<00:01:23.970> folding<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:25.040> see

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
being on the inside folding out see

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
being on the inside folding out see
there's<00:01:26.430> nothing<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:27.170> there<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
there's nothing here there on the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.580 
there's nothing here there on the
outside<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.450> don't<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> open<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
outside so you don't have to open the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.969 
outside so you don't have to open the
multi-tool<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.490> order<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.890> pull<00:01:34.890> out

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
multi-tool in order for you to pull out

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.230 
multi-tool in order for you to pull out
any<00:01:35.220> other<00:01:35.400> tools<00:01:36.680> on<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.979> side<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.909> side<00:01:39.119> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
any other tools on one side this side in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.040 
any other tools on one side this side in
particular

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.670 

you<00:01:44.650> just<00:01:44.830> get<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.040> serrated<00:01:45.700> blade<00:01:45.910> which<00:01:46.780> not

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
you just get a serrated blade which not

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.130 
you just get a serrated blade which not
really<00:01:48.190> certain<00:01:48.820> what<00:01:48.970> you<00:01:49.360> saw<00:01:49.600> really<00:01:49.960> have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
really certain what you saw really have

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.130 
really certain what you saw really have
for<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:50.590> other<00:01:50.950> than<00:01:51.430> perhaps<00:01:52.120> shaving<00:01:52.990> off

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
for this other than perhaps shaving off

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:03.630 
for this other than perhaps shaving off
magnesium<00:01:53.980> and<00:01:54.190> then<00:01:54.450> lighting<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.540> spark

other than that on the opposite side of
the<00:02:06.790> site<00:02:07.030> has<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.450> serrated<00:02:07.720> blade

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the site has the serrated blade

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:18.559 
the site has the serrated blade
is<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.830> scissor

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.539 

it's<00:02:19.019> pretty<00:02:19.319> decent<00:02:19.680> scissor<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.129> actually

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
it's pretty decent scissor it's actually

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.649 
it's pretty decent scissor it's actually
rated<00:02:20.819> up<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.799> cutting<00:02:22.909> 150<00:02:23.909> pound<00:02:24.150> tests

rated up to cutting 150 pound tests
fishing<00:02:25.019> line<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.640> don't<00:02:26.790> use<00:02:26.909> it<00:02:27.030> for

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
fishing line but if you don't use it for

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.619 
fishing line but if you don't use it for
that<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.450> guess<00:02:27.659> you<00:02:27.689> can<00:02:27.900> use<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.260> coupons

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
that I guess you can use it for coupons

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:37.720 
that I guess you can use it for coupons
and<00:02:30.629> on<00:02:31.469> the<00:02:31.590> other<00:02:31.739> side<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.609> have<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:36.109> saw

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and on the other side you have a saw

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.339 
and on the other side you have a saw
which<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.760> actually<00:02:39.209> why<00:02:39.329> I<00:02:39.359> bought<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.930> to

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
which is actually why I bought this to

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.710 
which is actually why I bought this to
begin<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.799> just<00:02:41.069> kind<00:02:41.909> of<00:02:41.939> replacing<00:02:42.599> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
begin with just kind of replacing a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.509 
begin with just kind of replacing a
bigger<00:02:42.959> knife<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> would<00:02:43.859> have<00:02:43.980> used<00:02:44.250> for

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
bigger knife that I would have used for

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.729 
bigger knife that I would have used for
a<00:02:44.549> saw<00:02:47.719> and<00:02:48.719> you<00:02:48.840> notice<00:02:49.139> that<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.439> both<00:02:49.680> sides

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
a saw and you notice that on both sides

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.199 
a saw and you notice that on both sides
you<00:02:50.189> have<00:02:50.340> these<00:02:50.519> locking<00:02:50.819> mechanisms<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
you have these locking mechanisms and

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.990 
you have these locking mechanisms and
you'll<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.629> pull<00:02:55.230> back<00:02:55.700> every<00:02:56.700> time<00:02:56.879> you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you'll have to pull back every time you

overall<00:05:02.259> I<00:05:02.470> find<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.280> more<00:05:03.520> major<00:05:04.410> tools

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
overall I find that the more major tools

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.640 
overall I find that the more major tools
of<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:06.160> actually<00:05:06.550> more<00:05:06.699> useful<00:05:07.650> aside

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
of this is actually more useful aside

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.379 
of this is actually more useful aside
from<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.949> bottle<00:05:09.220> opener<00:05:09.340> which<00:05:09.699> anybody<00:05:10.210> can

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
from a bottle opener which anybody can

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.469 
from a bottle opener which anybody can
benefit<00:05:10.780> from

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.499 

but<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.530> major<00:05:15.130> blades<00:05:15.610> is<00:05:15.880> actually<00:05:16.270> why<00:05:16.449> I

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
but the major blades is actually why I

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.850 
but the major blades is actually why I
bought<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.350> begin<00:05:17.500> with

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
bought this to begin with

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.189 
bought this to begin with
this<00:05:18.160> is<00:05:18.310> replacing<00:05:18.970> another<00:05:19.300> Gerber<00:05:19.840> unit

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
this is replacing another Gerber unit

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.629 
this is replacing another Gerber unit
and<00:05:22.199> overall<00:05:23.199> it's<00:05:23.590> pretty<00:05:23.830> useful<00:05:24.039> a<00:05:24.370> little

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
and overall it's pretty useful a little

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.920 
and overall it's pretty useful a little
bit<00:05:24.759> heavier<00:05:25.090> than<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.330> thought<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.630> was<00:05:25.720> going

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
bit heavier than I thought it was going

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.600 
bit heavier than I thought it was going
to<00:05:25.990> be<00:05:26.639> but<00:05:27.960> all<00:05:28.960> in<00:05:29.199> all<00:05:29.320> it's<00:05:29.889> it's<00:05:30.370> pretty

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
to be but all in all it's it's pretty

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.029 
to be but all in all it's it's pretty
sturdy<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.750> it's<00:05:32.050> got<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.199> good<00:05:32.830> locking

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
sturdy and it's got a good locking

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.270 
sturdy and it's got a good locking
mechanism<00:05:36.900> so<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:38.199> would<00:05:38.350> give<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:38.650> 4<00:05:38.919> out<00:05:38.949> of<00:05:39.130> 5

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
mechanism so I would give it 4 out of 5

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.800 
mechanism so I would give it 4 out of 5
