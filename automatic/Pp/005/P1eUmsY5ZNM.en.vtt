00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 today we'll talk a little bit about 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.049
 last friendly match with the team 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.519
 Meli and also about the results of this 3 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.929
 dual collection of tapes viktorovich well 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.700
 First , please several 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 Words always such last matches they 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.000
 naturally more everyone thinks about how 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.939
 don't get hurt though i believe that in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.460
 Overall a good match had had 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 advantage is expected yes but unfortunately 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 there are those moments that in the first half 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.939
 the second arose could not implement 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.059
 that is, the working information is normal 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.010
 mother is the main thing that finished without 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 damage that we all have accordingly 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.270
 already preparing for 1 calendar game you 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 slightly varied the game load in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.059
 This particular safe played 45 minutes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 other footballer is you in this plan 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.870
 proceeded from the level of readiness whether any 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.700
 There were considerations, but here all sorts of such 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.289
 Today Vernblum Ignashevich played 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.239
 full match because they 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.239
 disqualified for cup match 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 and accordingly, well there Ignashevich 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.350
 will play for the national team faith I know 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.750
 will not play, so here it is necessary 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.030
 it was to give them more such as load 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 someone a little less someone then 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.439
 there is a microdamage someone there like 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.100
 forgetting not trained the last couple 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.100
 days so it was based on a lot of factors 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 and current status and gaming employment 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 in the cup meeting and some 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 microdamage everyone understood the game is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.689
 the impression was more stubborn 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 rather than with the stream with the state of this what do you say 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.040
 about the level of the opponent this whether this team 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.620
 which as it seemed from them not 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.990
 we needed at this stage of preparation 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.330
 unfortunately we can not choose 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.580
 rivals happy at all 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.130
 fees would play 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.900
 miner and metalworker but we don't have 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.660
 such an opportunity therefore from those teams 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.340
 which are here initially we knew from 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.040
 who do we play for level 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.230
 rival but in my opinion despite 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.390
 the final result is a team of about 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.120
 level trams I do not see the principal 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.250
 differences ska we rather somewhere could not 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.000
 lick moments and somewhere maybe 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.190
 played but there is not at those speeds and yes 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.900
 not worth the dedication there as it were 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.880
 three days are needed 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.450
 what do you say in general here this collection 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.700
 now it is completed what all in the end 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.980
 managed to accomplish what we planned 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.770
 so the teams are good 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.190
 condition to the first calendar match 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.460
 so there are no apparent reasons that 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.350
 could prevent us from preparing no 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.290
 now it's up to us 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.050
 How to start a cup match and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.790
 Respectively the championship of the infirmary with us 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.739
 now at the moment only Alexander 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 Cauna what is the condition of Steven Zuber and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.730
 which in these matches did not take 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.140
 participation and how important that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.810
 really thank god without grass we 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.239
 do without injury is always important but 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.730
 without injury always fails the same 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.800
 just called there is no super but 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.069
 cramp ears were us fuel joint 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.880
 so how would 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.459
 return to the group can be expected 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.700
 every day it depends on him 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.050
 current well-being ie as soon as 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.209
 pain sensations 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.950
 leave him accordingly he will start 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.840
 work in a group 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.530
 But the boy is not corresponding too 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 the information was given you said that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.580
 satisfied with how the team spent 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.019
 here is this third gathering if we talk about 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.940
 that we have now in the near future 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.130
 already begin official matches as 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.540
 the team is ready for them at this stage 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.880
 the season is ready fully on Valery 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.549
 Kuzmich not remember not expressing his 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.880
 opinion on how the training is built 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.830
 work called and methodological in 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.290
 other aspects are about to work at the training camp 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.870
 flawless they could have a little bit 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.230
 really talk about that 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.390
 you planned it and how much it 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.280
 It turned out in the end but very 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.769
 nice firstly such kind words 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.250
 second you can find the subway 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.560
 logically build everything flawlessly but 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.940
 football has no direct formula which gives 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.340
 you have a positive result here and again 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.380
 same and not on flawless forms this is every 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.870
 builds as he sees fit 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.690
 based on their knowledge based on that 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.600
 what material is in the hands of what itself 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.570
 in fact, the goals are pursued 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.120
 team what philosophy system and so 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.360
 further so there is no sense of peace here 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.789
 deepen 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.139
 in any case, the answer to all of our 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.810
 preparation will be official matches and this 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.629
 how we will finish this season 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.159
 just his ending is clear that the tasks 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.020
 in front of our team is always traditional 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.849
 put as high as possible 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.340
 real chances to perform well in the cup 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.289
 in the national championship 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.030
 we will fight we will try to understand 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.370
 that a lot will be clear already 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.180
 literally in the first two rounds because 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.319
 dynamo zenith 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.500
 there are always a lot of head-on matches 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.879
 so this situation is determined here 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.150
 will not be an exception 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.830
 so we will try and be generous and 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.889
 prepared, I believe that we have 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.409
 absolutely all qualities in order 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.229
 so that 90 maximum results 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.909
 as it will, respectively, look at 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.610
 what mode will the command work 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:25.430
 Now returning to the capital, we 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.430
 Tomorrow we fly to Moscow. We will have 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.520
 day off 28 we will start working on the base 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.849
 vatutin how to prepare a cup duel 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.800
 after which we have 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.709
 unfortunately this is a large group of players 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.770
 and there is the composition of the national teams to 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:44.439
 Fortunately, all these all national teams are playing 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.719
 Europe is only with Musa can 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:49.929
 problems arise how can nigeria 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:52.659
 it does not need to be played well and accordingly 

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:55.270
 we will already wait for players from the national 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.059
 national team and look in what condition is not 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.919
 come back now of course another championship 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.020
 not renewed but by your two here 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.779
 of these key fights with dynamos and 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.849
 the zenith of their best to spend at this stage 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.649
 season or if it were but again 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.229
 theorizes the ability to choose you would 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:13.539
 I prefer to play a little later I never 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.509
 I do not think in such categories we are beautiful 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.999
 know the calendar and at least by 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:22.149
 tours as it is distributed, we are not completely 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:24.399
 We know the dates us this Matchday 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.269
 talk about how it would be better or 

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:28.179
 worse 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:31.059
 there is no sense we actually have 

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:33.779
 calendars and we knew perfectly well with whom and 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.779
 when will we play
