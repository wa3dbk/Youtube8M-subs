okay so this is a demonstration of how

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.390 
okay so this is a demonstration of how
to<00:00:07.919> fold<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:10.580> sleeve<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.780> CD<00:00:13.290> or<00:00:13.710> DVD<00:00:14.490> and

to fold a sleeve for a CD or DVD and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
to fold a sleeve for a CD or DVD and
what<00:00:17.400> I've<00:00:17.490> got<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.029> eight<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> half

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
what I've got here is a eight and a half

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.769 
what I've got here is a eight and a half
by<00:00:19.050> eleven<00:00:19.859> sheet<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.250> paper<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.420> have

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
by eleven sheet of paper and I have

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.939 
by eleven sheet of paper and I have
decorated<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:23.060> my<00:00:24.650> picture<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.740> myself

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
decorated it with my picture of myself

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.910 
decorated it with my picture of myself
and<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:29.099> very<00:00:29.340> faint<00:00:29.849> guidelines

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
and I have some very faint guidelines

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
and I have some very faint guidelines
printed<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.669> probably<00:00:33.090> cannot

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
printed on here that you probably cannot

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.810 
printed on here that you probably cannot
see<00:00:34.250> but<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.450> an<00:00:36.630> aid<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> folding

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
see but are there as an aid to folding

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
see but are there as an aid to folding
so<00:00:40.250> at<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.399> rate<00:00:41.640> I'll<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.450> fold<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> these

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
so at a rate I'll just fold one of these

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
so at a rate I'll just fold one of these
up<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> figure<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
up and you can you can figure out the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.389 
up and you can you can figure out the
details<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.739> yourself<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.860> by<00:00:49.860> using<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
details for yourself but by using the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.270 
details for yourself but by using the
guidelines<00:00:50.969> i<00:00:51.329> am<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:54.469> crease<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
guidelines i am going to crease it on

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.099 
guidelines i am going to crease it on
each<00:00:56.969> side<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:57.930> approximately<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> same

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
each side that is approximately the same

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.560 
each side that is approximately the same
width<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:02.180> as<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> disc<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> i'll<00:01:06.060> lay<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
width as a as the disc so i'll lay the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
width as a as the disc so i'll lay the
disk<00:01:06.840> over<00:01:07.110> there<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
disk over there so you can get and get a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.039 
disk over there so you can get and get a
feel<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.350> that's<00:01:11.450> approximately<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
feel for it that's approximately it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
feel for it that's approximately it
right<00:01:13.460> okay<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:21.170> fold<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
right okay and then fold it up from the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.230 
right okay and then fold it up from the
bottom<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> mean<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:29.240> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
bottom so I mean that would be the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.980 
bottom so I mean that would be the
bottom<00:01:30.600> there<00:01:30.810> okay<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> tricky

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
bottom there okay and this is the tricky

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.160 
bottom there okay and this is the tricky
part<00:01:34.939> you<00:01:35.939> need<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.720> fold<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.310> corner

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.160 

up<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> same<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.899> on

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
up like this and do the same thing on

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.289 
up like this and do the same thing on
the<00:01:46.380> other<00:01:46.409> side

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.240 

here<00:01:55.299> let<00:01:55.570> me<00:01:55.659> turn<00:01:56.439> this<00:01:56.590> around<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.130> can

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
here let me turn this around so you can

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.719 
here let me turn this around so you can
see<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> little<00:01:57.789> bit<00:01:58.000> better<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:59.229> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
see it a little bit better like that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:10.699 
see it a little bit better like that
okay<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:00.969> then<00:02:06.479> fold<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.659> down<00:02:08.519> comme<00:02:09.519> side

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
okay and then fold it down comme side

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.150 
okay and then fold it down comme side
okay<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.130> now<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.209> looks<00:02:13.330> like<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.260> this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
okay so now it looks like that and this

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.870 
okay so now it looks like that and this
allows<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> tuck<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.459> flap<00:02:18.459> here

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
allows you then to tuck this flap here

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.710 
allows you then to tuck this flap here
behind<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:20.319> fold<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.830> there<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.519> both<00:02:22.390> sides

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
behind the fold in there on both sides

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.720 
behind the fold in there on both sides
and<00:02:23.970> what's<00:02:24.970> neat<00:02:25.150> about<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:26.069> or<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.549> reason

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and what's neat about that or the reason

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.850 
and what's neat about that or the reason
you<00:02:28.000> do<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.170> kind<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.440> pulls

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
you do that is is that it kind of pulls

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.650 
you do that is is that it kind of pulls
the<00:02:30.160> whole<00:02:30.340> thing<00:02:30.640> together<00:02:30.819> it's<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.569> a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the whole thing together it's like a

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.819 
the whole thing together it's like a
little<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:34.329> know<00:02:34.360> catch<00:02:34.750> or<00:02:35.380> something<00:02:35.709> like

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
little you know catch or something like

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.839 
little you know catch or something like
that<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.540> anyway<00:02:37.870> now<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.079> it's<00:02:38.470> it's

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
that so so anyway now that it's it's

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.050 
that so so anyway now that it's it's
it's<00:02:39.849> like<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.660> tends<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.940> tense<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
it's like that it tends to tense the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.729 
it's like that it tends to tense the
whole<00:02:43.120> together<00:02:43.690> okay<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.989> let's<00:02:46.989> see<00:02:47.230> all

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
whole together okay and let's see all

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.550 
whole together okay and let's see all
right<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:48.459> there's<00:02:48.670> finally<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:50.530> last

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
right so then there's finally one last

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.490 
right so then there's finally one last
fold<00:02:51.190> at<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> top<00:02:51.730> which<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:54.569> flap<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.930> in

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
fold at the top which is the flap and in

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.920 
fold at the top which is the flap and in
order<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.889> make<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:59.040> insert<00:03:00.040> easily<00:03:00.850> kind<00:03:01.840> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
order to make that insert easily kind of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.819 
order to make that insert easily kind of
tuck<00:03:02.170> these<00:03:02.350> ears<00:03:02.799> down<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:08.290> that

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
tuck these ears down and then that

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.629 
tuck these ears down and then that
allows<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:11.530> slide<00:03:12.040> into<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:14.230> sleeve

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
allows this to slide into the sleeve

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.699 
allows this to slide into the sleeve
like<00:03:15.639> that<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.420> then<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> usually<00:03:17.319> just<00:03:17.350> kind

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
like that and then I usually just kind

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.199 
like that and then I usually just kind
of<00:03:17.769> burnish<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.310> whole<00:03:18.489> thing<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:22.060> you

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
of burnish the whole thing and as you

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.509 
of burnish the whole thing and as you
can<00:03:22.359> see<00:03:22.389> give<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> nice<00:03:23.620> little<00:03:23.889> white

the the cover or it could be you know
anything<00:03:52.620> from<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.670> know<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:57.590> self-portrait

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
anything from you know a self-portrait

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.090 
anything from you know a self-portrait
like<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.310> or<00:03:59.610> any<00:04:00.540> design<00:04:00.960> you<00:04:00.990> desired<00:04:01.590> so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
like this or any design you desired so

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.740 
like this or any design you desired so
that's<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.960> way<00:04:04.110> it's<00:04:04.320> done<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.940> guess<00:04:06.390> let

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
that's the way it's done and I guess let

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.530 
that's the way it's done and I guess let
me<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:06.990> deconstruct<00:04:07.380> this<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.210> you<00:04:09.390> can

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
me just deconstruct this so that you can

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:24.670 
me just deconstruct this so that you can
see<00:04:09.750> what<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.990> looks<00:04:10.200> like<00:04:21.350> so<00:04:22.350> that<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:23.010> again

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
see what it looks like so that is again

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:36.550 
see what it looks like so that is again
the<00:04:25.910> kind<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.940> complicated<00:04:27.510> i<00:04:27.690> guess<00:04:34.370> but<00:04:35.450> and

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
the kind of complicated i guess but and

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.400 
the kind of complicated i guess but and
takes<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.650> couple<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.950> minutes<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.370> do<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.640> but

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
takes a couple of minutes to do it but

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.690 
takes a couple of minutes to do it but
anyway<00:04:40.410> it's<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:41.190> you've<00:04:41.370> got<00:04:41.580> an<00:04:41.790> 85<00:04:43.190> by<00:04:44.190> 11

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
anyway it's if you've got an 85 by 11

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.490 
anyway it's if you've got an 85 by 11
sheet<00:04:44.730> of<00:04:45.090> paper<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.630> can<00:04:45.750> easily<00:04:45.960> make<00:04:46.260> one

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
sheet of paper you can easily make one

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.950 
sheet of paper you can easily make one
of<00:04:46.590> these<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:47.070> could<00:04:47.280> be<00:04:47.460> somewhat<00:04:48.330> more

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
of these it could be somewhat more

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.370 
of these it could be somewhat more
simple<00:04:49.410> than<00:04:49.440> than<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.420> design<00:04:51.420> but<00:04:51.840> this

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
simple than than this design but this

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.000 
simple than than this design but this
has<00:04:52.530> got<00:04:52.770> some<00:04:53.310> nice<00:04:53.490> features<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.600> that

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
has got some nice features to it so that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.030 
has got some nice features to it so that
you<00:04:56.010> know<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.220> seems<00:04:56.460> like<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> little<00:04:56.730> bit

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
you know it seems like a little bit

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.060 
you know it seems like a little bit
better<00:04:59.040> constructed<00:04:59.720> anywho<00:05:01.010> that's<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.340> and

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
better constructed anywho that's it and

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.220 
better constructed anywho that's it and
there<00:05:05.070> you<00:05:05.190> go
