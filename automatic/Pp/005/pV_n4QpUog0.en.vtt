the<00:03:50.450> fly<00:03:50.660> over<00:03:50.960> there<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.590> I'm<00:03:51.740> really<00:03:51.950> only

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
the fly over there so I'm really only

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.400 
the fly over there so I'm really only
programming<00:03:52.820> volumes<00:03:53.270> with<00:03:53.510> these<00:03:53.660> guys<00:03:53.930> you

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
programming volumes with these guys you

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.450 
programming volumes with these guys you
know<00:03:54.440> I'm<00:03:54.560> changing<00:03:54.710> how<00:03:55.040> much<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.310> actually

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
know I'm changing how much is actually

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.490 
know I'm changing how much is actually
brown<00:03:55.820> ball<00:03:56.030> yeah<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:56.660> is<00:03:56.810> pre<00:03:57.020> ground<00:03:57.260> for

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
brown ball yeah this is pre ground for

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.830 
brown ball yeah this is pre ground for
your<00:03:57.620> bypass<00:03:57.950> doser<00:03:58.220> up<00:03:58.520> here<00:03:58.730> one<00:03:59.300> scoot<00:03:59.630> of

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
your bypass doser up here one scoot of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.920 
your bypass doser up here one scoot of
one<00:04:00.050> beam<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:01.340> beam<00:04:01.550> three<00:04:01.910> beam<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.270> typical

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
one beam to beam three beam and typical

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
one beam to beam three beam and typical
on<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.140> seco<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.590> seven<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.160> ten<00:04:04.370> grams<00:04:04.670> okay

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
on the seco is seven to ten grams okay

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.850 
on the seco is seven to ten grams okay
between<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.750> top<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.200> bottom<00:04:06.470> there<00:04:06.620> so

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
between the top of the bottom there so

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.220 
between the top of the bottom there so
let's<00:04:07.670> get<00:04:07.850> some<00:04:08.030> milk<00:04:08.360> what<00:04:08.870> do<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.050> think
