00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
the Smarties the most realistic practice

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.590 
the Smarties the most realistic practice
gear<00:00:02.010> that<00:00:02.220> I've<00:00:02.310> ever<00:00:02.490> wrote<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.270> head<00:00:03.449> is

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
gear that I've ever wrote the head is

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.720 
gear that I've ever wrote the head is
the<00:00:03.720> most<00:00:03.929> realistic<00:00:04.319> thing<00:00:05.190> I've<00:00:05.339> ever<00:00:05.370> roped

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
the most realistic thing I've ever roped

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.240 
the most realistic thing I've ever roped
on<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> practice<00:00:06.509> steer<00:00:06.779> it's<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> same<00:00:08.010> size

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
on a practice steer it's the same size

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.370 
on a practice steer it's the same size
as<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.639> traditional<00:00:09.269> head<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> steer<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
as a traditional head on a steer in the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.980 
as a traditional head on a steer in the
way<00:00:11.309> its<00:00:11.460> shape<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.210> steer<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.870> so

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
way its shape is like a steer and so

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.330 
way its shape is like a steer and so
that's<00:00:13.170> what<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.469> want<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.740> translate<00:00:14.070> Pro

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
that's what we want to translate Pro

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.640 
that's what we want to translate Pro
ropers<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.790> try<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> translate<00:00:15.509> everything

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
ropers we try to translate everything

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
ropers we try to translate everything
from<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> ground<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
from what we do on the ground to the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.019 
from what we do on the ground to the
horse<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.650> roping<00:00:20.070> live<00:00:20.250> cattle<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.880> that's

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
horse to roping live cattle and that's

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
horse to roping live cattle and that's
what<00:00:21.180> smartie<00:00:21.510> does<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.560> many<00:00:22.740> times

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
what smartie does for you how many times

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
what smartie does for you how many times
is<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> header<00:00:23.630> me<00:00:24.630> personally<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> would<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
is a header me personally I would like a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.080 
is a header me personally I would like a
steer<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.000> don't

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
steer to go to the right but we don't

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.189 
steer to go to the right but we don't
have<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> steer<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.689> goes<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> right

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
have a steer that goes to the right

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
have a steer that goes to the right
because<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> key<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> heading<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.670> if

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
because I think the key to heading is if

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
because I think the key to heading is if
your<00:00:29.970> head<00:00:30.119> works<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> wants<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
your head works and wants to go to the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.569 
your head works and wants to go to the
right<00:00:31.199> he's<00:00:31.590> gonna<00:00:31.710> run<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> hardest<00:00:32.369> that's

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
right he's gonna run the hardest that's

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
right he's gonna run the hardest that's
gonna<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> Vantage<00:00:33.329> D<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
gonna be a Vantage D when you go to the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.680 
gonna be a Vantage D when you go to the
rodeo<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.620> roping<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.540> on

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
rodeo or roping and so we can do that on

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
rodeo or roping and so we can do that on
smarty<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:38.070> from<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> box<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
smarty we can go from the box and have

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
smarty we can go from the box and have
the<00:00:39.149> person<00:00:39.360> that's<00:00:39.719> driving<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the person that's driving it go off to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.380 
the person that's driving it go off to
the<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.520> make<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> pattern<00:00:42.239> we

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the right we can make the pattern we

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
the right we can make the pattern we
need<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.780> our<00:00:42.870> horse<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
need for our horse at that time and I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.930 
need for our horse at that time and I
think<00:00:44.520> it'll<00:00:44.940> allow<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.309> get<00:00:47.309> good<00:00:47.550> control

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
think it'll allow us to get good control

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
think it'll allow us to get good control
of<00:00:47.969> our<00:00:48.149> horse<00:00:48.329> making<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.899> where<00:00:49.050> he<00:00:49.140> wants<00:00:49.410> us

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of our horse making go where he wants us

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
of our horse making go where he wants us
to<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> make<00:00:50.610> us<00:00:50.789> better<00:00:50.969> Rovers<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to go and make us better Rovers for it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
to go and make us better Rovers for it
I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.829> regions<00:00:53.280> huge<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> dummy<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
I think regions huge on the dummy and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
I think regions huge on the dummy and
here's<00:00:54.420> why<00:00:54.600> people<00:00:55.020> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.410> better

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
here's why people want to get better

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
here's why people want to get better
reaching<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> ask<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.059> say<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
reaching and I ask how I say you just

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
reaching and I ask how I say you just
gotta<00:00:57.989> throw<00:00:58.320> faster<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> sounds<00:00:59.219> simple<00:00:59.430> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
gotta throw faster it sounds simple but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
gotta throw faster it sounds simple but
you<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.120> gotta<00:01:00.329> throw<00:01:00.539> before<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you really you gotta throw before it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
you really you gotta throw before it
feels<00:01:01.980> comfortable<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
feels comfortable that's what we

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.700 
feels comfortable that's what we
reaching<00:01:03.420> usually<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> gradually

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
reaching usually is and you gradually

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
reaching usually is and you gradually
move<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> practice

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
move it back but we get to the practice

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.510 
move it back but we get to the practice
pin<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.439> feel<00:01:07.619> uncomfortable<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.250> steers

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pin and we feel uncomfortable on steers

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.070 
pin and we feel uncomfortable on steers
because<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:09.060> miss<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.900> what's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
because we miss because that's what's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.300 
because we miss because that's what's
gonna<00:01:10.200> happen<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> start<00:01:10.830> working<00:01:11.250> on

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
gonna happen when you start working on

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
gonna happen when you start working on
reaching<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> can't<00:01:12.090> catch<00:01:12.390> enough<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
reaching and you can't catch enough in a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
reaching and you can't catch enough in a
row<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.909> discouraged<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.570> your

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
row and so you get discouraged your your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.420 
row and so you get discouraged your your
partner's<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.350> discouraged<00:01:16.770> put<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:16.979> smarty

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
partner's get discouraged put on smarty

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
partner's get discouraged put on smarty
it<00:01:17.939> allows<00:01:18.180> us<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.689> miss<00:01:18.840> 10<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> row

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it allows us we can miss 10 in a row

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
it allows us we can miss 10 in a row
when<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> back<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
when we can back in there and do it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
when we can back in there and do it
again<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> eventually<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> enough

really good it's the same width the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
really good it's the same width the
horns<00:02:58.480> are<00:02:58.660> wider<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.950> can<00:03:00.100> throw

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
horns are wider so that you can throw

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.630 
horns are wider so that you can throw
have<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> lot<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.470> coverage<00:03:02.800> in<00:03:03.010> your<00:03:03.160> loop<00:03:03.370> but

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
have a lot of coverage in your loop but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.060 
have a lot of coverage in your loop but
yet<00:03:03.820> they're<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.000> extra<00:03:04.720> big<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.680> where<00:03:05.860> that

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
yet they're not extra big to where that

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.610 
yet they're not extra big to where that
you're<00:03:06.340> you're<00:03:07.090> basically<00:03:07.810> developing<00:03:08.380> bad

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you're you're basically developing bad

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.200 
you're you're basically developing bad
habits<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.250> trying<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.640> cover<00:03:09.880> too<00:03:10.180> much

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
habits of trying to cover too much

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.270 
habits of trying to cover too much
because<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:10.960> don't<00:03:10.990> rope<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.470> lot<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.740> big<00:03:11.890> horns

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
because we don't rope a lot of big horns

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.190 
because we don't rope a lot of big horns
and<00:03:12.459> we<00:03:12.580> wanted<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.060> be<00:03:13.270> as<00:03:13.360> realistic<00:03:13.780> as

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
and we wanted it to be as realistic as

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.630 
and we wanted it to be as realistic as
as<00:03:14.850> possible<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.270> legs<00:03:16.510> are<00:03:17.160> realistic<00:03:18.160> legs

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
as possible the legs are realistic legs

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.480 
as possible the legs are realistic legs
that<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.120> throw<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> real<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.920> can<00:03:21.280> throw

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
that you can throw a real you can throw

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.400 
that you can throw a real you can throw
the<00:03:21.640> same<00:03:21.880> loop<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:22.360> smarties<00:03:22.959> legs<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
the same loop on smarties legs as you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.500 
the same loop on smarties legs as you
can<00:03:23.740> on<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.070> live<00:03:24.280> steer<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.820> that's<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.120> first

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
can on it live steer and that's a first

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.900 
can on it live steer and that's a first
time<00:03:26.290> I've<00:03:26.500> seen<00:03:26.680> anybody<00:03:27.010> be<00:03:27.370> able<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.730> do

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
time I've seen anybody be able to do

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.880 
time I've seen anybody be able to do
that<00:03:28.090> with<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.330> practice<00:03:28.510> here<00:03:29.050> ride<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.800> the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
that with the practice here ride in the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.830 
that with the practice here ride in the
corner<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.520> Smarty<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.180> realistic

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
corner on the Smarty is realistic

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.310 
corner on the Smarty is realistic
because<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:32.200> put<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.740> on<00:03:33.010> skis<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.360> it's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
because I put it on on skis and it's

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.710 
because I put it on on skis and it's
able<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.730> behind<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.790> four-wheeler<00:03:37.480> it's

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
able to behind the four-wheeler it's

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.080 
able to behind the four-wheeler it's
able<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.110> reproduce<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:39.040> real<00:03:39.250> corner<00:03:39.550> behind

able to reproduce a real corner behind

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.240 
able to reproduce a real corner behind
it<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.810> spring<00:03:41.140> loaded<00:03:41.410> system<00:03:41.740> that<00:03:42.130> we

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
it the spring loaded system that we

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.100 
it the spring loaded system that we
created<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.880> smartie<00:03:43.330> starts<00:03:43.720> with<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
created with smartie starts with the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.470 
created with smartie starts with the
legs<00:03:44.320> coming<00:03:44.650> together<00:03:44.860> coming<00:03:45.820> back<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
legs coming together coming back and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.270 
legs coming together coming back and
then<00:03:46.660> our<00:03:46.810> tow<00:03:47.020> bar<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.560> spring<00:03:47.890> loaded<00:03:47.920> so

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
then our tow bar is spring loaded so

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.460 
then our tow bar is spring loaded so
that<00:03:49.000> when<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.300> when<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.600> rope<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.020> legs<00:03:50.230> and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
that when you when you rope the legs and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.320 
that when you when you rope the legs and
we're<00:03:50.590> seeing<00:03:50.800> how<00:03:51.010> fast<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.640> can<00:03:51.790> come<00:03:52.030> tight

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
we're seeing how fast you can come tight

we're seeing how fast you can come tight
there's<00:03:53.050> never<00:03:53.290> gonna<00:03:53.500> be<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.770> hard<00:03:54.070> jerk

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
there's never gonna be a hard jerk

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.850 
there's never gonna be a hard jerk

because even in our tow bar there's
forgiveness<00:03:57.580> there<00:03:58.180> we<00:03:58.360> have<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> spring<00:03:58.959> there

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
forgiveness there we have a spring there

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.330 
forgiveness there we have a spring there
