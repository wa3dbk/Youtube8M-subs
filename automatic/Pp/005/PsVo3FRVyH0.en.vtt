00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 off to the swimming pool at the temperatures 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.470
 the last weeks, the freewheelers report 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.900
 regular visitor records in some 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.429
 people who cool off in the water 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.309
 but they can not swim at all 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 And these are not just children every year 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 a good hundred adults register 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 beginner swimming lessons at 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.250
 many of them are already in the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.090
 retirement age we have one of these 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.500
 late-called at his first 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.500
 accompanied by swimming tests 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360
 b 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.180
 this opera wants for his grandson 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.130
 learn to swim with him one day 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.100
 carefree to play in the water 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.000
 as a child, that had missed less 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.800
 Nevertheless, city players and smokers smoke 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.230
 now what are you hoping for when you are 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.750
 now you can swim the seahorse 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.240
 my children and my wife 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.940
 or grandchildren makes joy 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.910
 and of course always in me too 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.390
 Japan on the sea or at the lake or 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.150
 stay somewhere outside or eat 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.840
 There is nothing but it is really one 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.340
 reason why that on 104 count then it 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.960
 It was really of interest 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.960
 meanwhile makes a little fun 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.000
 you can not do it 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.260
 we are growing much more afraid are a lot 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.540
 Many people are less sure about the uncertainty 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.530
 Dare already done and it is very 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.790
 hard when the trust to the water 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.380
 to teach or to feel 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.940
 that they can trust 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.620
 The problem is that if you are very much 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.090
 fear now time I cramped 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.560
 always compare that with a feather and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.720
 with a stone if I'm easy 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.130
 I almost breathe like a feather 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.660
 then i can do my job 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.520
 Do not do anything if I'm afraid of the world 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.710
 as heavy as a stone called stones 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.840
 the adults do not swimm 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.209
 fear of the water is therefore 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.709
 the most important and of course it costs 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.320
 Older people too much overcoming 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.190
 in public as a beginner 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.900
 present 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:23.299
 curious and flies safe 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.299
 the great opponent overhead fun 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.790
 after five to ten units are 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.040
 already first successes visible 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.240
 so it's never too late with that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.240
 start swimming
