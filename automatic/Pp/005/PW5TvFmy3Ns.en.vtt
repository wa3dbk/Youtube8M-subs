on that thing but a lot of it's a real
good-looking<00:00:37.739> bike<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.250> mean<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.730> said<00:00:38.760> we

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
good-looking bike I mean like I said we

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.119

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that four wheels could probably use a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.580 
that four wheels could probably use a
little<00:00:43.800> more<00:00:43.920> attention<00:00:45.079> there<00:00:46.079> mainly<00:00:46.260> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
little more attention there mainly just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.619

of<00:00:51.660> getting<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.960> hurry<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.129> we

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
of getting a hurry on this one so we

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.439 
of getting a hurry on this one so we
kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.670> run<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> through<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> little

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
kind of run it through it a little

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
kind of run it through it a little
quicker<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:56.329> anyway<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:58.399> well<00:00:59.399> I'd<00:00:59.550> say

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
quicker but anyway this is well I'd say

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.400 
quicker but anyway this is well I'd say
it's<00:00:59.879> about<00:00:59.940> 70<00:01:00.420> percent<00:01:00.570> complete<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> still

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

I don't think I'm gonna be hooking this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.039 
I don't think I'm gonna be hooking this
stuff<00:01:48.090> back<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
stuff back up this is the the for the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.620 
stuff back up this is the the for the
extra<00:01:52.590> oil<00:01:55.670> instead<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.759> mixing<00:01:57.030> your<00:01:57.149> gases

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
extra oil instead of mixing your gases

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.030 
extra oil instead of mixing your gases
or<00:01:57.869> mixing<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> gas<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> oil<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.979> will

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
or mixing the gas and oil this will

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
or mixing the gas and oil this will
actually<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> little

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
actually do it for you this is a little

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.280 
actually do it for you this is a little
pump<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.770> right<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.110> think

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
pump for it right here but I don't think

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.480 
pump for it right here but I don't think
I'm<00:02:04.469> gonna<00:02:04.560> hook<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.890> back<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.250> because<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
I'm gonna hook that back up because I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.649 
I'm gonna hook that back up because I
don't<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.850> tank<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.270> back<00:02:06.479> I'm

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
don't want the tank on the back I'm

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
don't want the tank on the back I'm
gonna<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:06.960> number<00:02:07.229> plates<00:02:07.469> instead<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
gonna use number plates instead of I

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279 
gonna use number plates instead of I
mean<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.060> guess<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.330> could<00:02:09.539> cover<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.020> there

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
mean I guess I could cover it up there

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.720 
mean I guess I could cover it up there
but<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.590> more<00:02:10.830> junk<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:11.580> I'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
but it's just more junk on there I'm

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.180 
but it's just more junk on there I'm
just<00:02:11.790> trying

just trying
minimize<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:12.940> bike<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:16.540> inside

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160
