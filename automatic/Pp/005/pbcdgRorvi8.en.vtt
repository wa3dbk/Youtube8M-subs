00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
reverb to you know a lot of times in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.160 
reverb to you know a lot of times in
recordings<00:00:21.210> especially<00:00:21.600> things<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:21.900> Led

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
recordings especially things like Led

things<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.410> hear<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.859> big<00:00:26.220> room<00:00:26.550> sound<00:00:27.090> this

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
things you hear that big room sound this

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
things you hear that big room sound this
is<00:00:28.019> gonna<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.769> way<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.609> big<00:00:29.820> room

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
is gonna be a way to get that big room

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
is gonna be a way to get that big room
sound<00:00:30.240> hopefully<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> smaller

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
sound hopefully but in a smaller

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.880 
sound hopefully but in a smaller
environment<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.669> might<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.890> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
environment like you might also have so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
environment like you might also have so
me<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.460> today<00:00:35.790> I'm<00:00:35.880> using<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.329> electric

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
me you know today I'm using the electric

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
me you know today I'm using the electric
guitar<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> example<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> did<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
guitar as the example so I did the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220 
guitar as the example so I did the
typical<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> put<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> microphone

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
typical thing where I put a microphone

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
typical thing where I put a microphone
right<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.800> against<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> speaker<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
right up against the speaker of the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
right up against the speaker of the
amplifier<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.800> off<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> center<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
amplifier right off to the center of it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
amplifier right off to the center of it
obviously<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> took<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.500> second

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
obviously but then I took a second

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.400 
obviously but then I took a second
microphone<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.780> case<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> be

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
microphone in this case it's going to be

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.830 
microphone in this case it's going to be
the<00:00:49.649> Caddy<00:00:49.890> 70<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> small<00:00:51.420> diaphragm

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the Caddy 70 which is a small diaphragm

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.290 
the Caddy 70 which is a small diaphragm
microphone<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.680> any<00:00:52.829> microphone<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:54.000> work

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
microphone but any microphone will work

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
microphone but any microphone will work
for<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.629> any<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.140> microphones<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.890> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
for this any two microphones that you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.170 
for this any two microphones that you
like<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:57.210> work<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.960> idea<00:00:59.180> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
like to use will work with this idea so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.819 
like to use will work with this idea so
then<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> took<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> second<00:01:01.079> microphone<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
then I took a second microphone and I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
then I took a second microphone and I
put<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.280> actually<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> hallway<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.809> my

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
put it out actually in the hallway of my

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.100 
put it out actually in the hallway of my
apartment<00:01:04.850> my<00:01:05.850> room<00:01:05.880> small<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.020> know

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
apartment my room small if you you know

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
apartment my room small if you you know
have<00:01:07.320> space<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.670> put<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
have space or you know you can put the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
have space or you know you can put the
microphone<00:01:09.240> wherever<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> have

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
microphone wherever you want I have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
microphone wherever you want I have
found<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> bathrooms<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:12.090> work

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
found that bathrooms also really work

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
found that bathrooms also really work
well<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.170> no<00:01:13.320> carpeting<00:01:13.890> my

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
well because you know no carpeting my

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920 
well because you know no carpeting my
hallway<00:01:14.610> doesn't<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.060> any<00:01:15.180> carpeting<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
hallway doesn't have any carpeting so I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
hallway doesn't have any carpeting so I
was<00:01:16.320> lucky<00:01:16.590> enough<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> lot

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
was lucky enough you know so I get a lot

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.690 
was lucky enough you know so I get a lot
of<00:01:18.299> reverb<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.840> space<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:20.250> bathrooms

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
of reverb in that space but bathrooms

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
of reverb in that space but bathrooms
are<00:01:21.479> great<00:01:21.900> places<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:22.979> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
are great places to look for that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.760 
are great places to look for that
natural<00:01:23.430> reverb<00:01:23.759> sound<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.380> anyway

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
natural reverb sound as well so anyway

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
natural reverb sound as well so anyway
so<00:01:26.130> yeah<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.670> microphone<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.659> against

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so yeah one microphone right up against

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
so yeah one microphone right up against
the<00:01:28.110> speaker<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.520> microphone

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the speaker and then a second microphone

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.330 
the speaker and then a second microphone
you<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.689> basically<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.259> room<00:01:31.710> mic<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.130> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you know basically a room mic you I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
you know basically a room mic you I
could<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.700> had<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.299> room<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.930> decided

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
could have had it in this room I decided

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
could have had it in this room I decided
to<00:01:34.590> put<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.460> put<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> even

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
to put it out there I could put it even

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
to put it out there I could put it even
farther<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> could<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> closer<00:01:37.409> it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
farther I could have put a closer it's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
farther I could have put a closer it's
really<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> where<00:01:39.030> thats<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.420> second

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
really up to you where thats like second

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
really up to you where thats like second
microphone<00:01:40.680> goes<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
microphone goes but that's really the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.929 
microphone goes but that's really the
trick<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> secret<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.490> second

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
trick the secret is that second

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.020 
trick the secret is that second
microphone<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
microphone that's out there so then I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.940 
microphone that's out there so then I
blended<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> into<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> recording<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.740> heard

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
blended it into a recording and I heard

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.069 
blended it into a recording and I heard
it<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.220> yeah<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> mean<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.939> figured<00:01:51.810> out<00:01:51.899> where

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it and yeah I mean I figured out where

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.810 
it and yeah I mean I figured out where
the<00:01:52.200> microphone<00:01:52.590> sounded<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the microphone sounded right and I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
the microphone sounded right and I
started<00:01:54.240> recording<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
started recording and it really was a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.670 
started recording and it really was a
great<00:01:56.009> thing<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> add<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.659> now<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.350> try
