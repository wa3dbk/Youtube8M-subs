00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.330 

what's<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.199> on<00:00:01.260> everyone<00:00:01.860> it's<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.190> queue

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
what's going on everyone it's the queue

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.919 
what's going on everyone it's the queue
ologist<00:00:02.730> here<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.179> today<00:00:03.480> we're<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.840> be

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
ologist here and today we're going to be

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.209 
ologist here and today we're going to be
covering<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.620> art<00:00:04.799> permutations<00:00:12.980> alright<00:00:13.980> so

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
covering the art permutations alright so

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.450 
covering the art permutations alright so
this<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.030> RA<00:00:15.440> permutation<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.130> way

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
this is the RA permutation now the way

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730 
this is the RA permutation now the way
that<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.699> recognize<00:00:18.150> these<00:00:18.390> cases<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.439> by

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that I recognize these cases is by

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.230 
that I recognize these cases is by
seeing<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.640> set<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> headlights

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
seeing that I have a set of headlights

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.740 
seeing that I have a set of headlights
right<00:00:22.170> here<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.400> an<00:00:23.939> opposite<00:00:24.510> color

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
right here this is not an opposite color

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.960 
right here this is not an opposite color
of<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> headlights<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.070> no<00:00:26.250> matter<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.730> if

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of the headlights so no matter what if

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
of the headlights so no matter what if
these<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.449> blue<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> green<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
these are blue and this is green it's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
these are blue and this is green it's
not<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.070> art<00:00:29.250> firm<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.000> that's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
not going to be an art firm so that's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
not going to be an art firm so that's
one<00:00:30.330> way<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.920> completely<00:00:31.920> distinguish

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
one way you can completely distinguish

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
one way you can completely distinguish
whether<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.719> art<00:00:33.870> perm<00:00:34.050> from<00:00:34.230> one

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
whether or not it's an art perm from one

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.650 
whether or not it's an art perm from one
side<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.100> least<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.579> eliminate<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
side or at least you can eliminate that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
side or at least you can eliminate that
it<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.079> an<00:00:37.200> art<00:00:37.410> perm<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.399> these

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
it is an art perm if you see that these

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
it is an art perm if you see that these
are<00:00:38.670> opposite<00:00:39.390> colors<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
are opposite colors so we see that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
are opposite colors so we see that
they're<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:40.829> opposite<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:41.969> an<00:00:42.090> art

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
they're not opposite now with an art

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.670 
they're not opposite now with an art
perm<00:00:42.510> you're<00:00:42.750> either<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> 2x1

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

notice that the 2x1 block is always
going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:05.210> counterclockwise<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.170> face

going to be counterclockwise of the face

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
going to be counterclockwise of the face
that<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.119> 2x1

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that it's on so if you see that this 2x1

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.890 
that it's on so if you see that this 2x1
block<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> orange<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.880> face<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> left

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
block is orange and the face on the left
of<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.680> orange<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
of that is also orange you know that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.880 
of that is also orange you know that
it's<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.780> solved<00:01:16.259> without<00:01:16.409> having

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's going to be solved without having

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520 
it's going to be solved without having
to<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:17.369> au<00:01:17.640> F<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> little<00:01:19.350> bit

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to do an au F so it's a little bit

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
to do an au F so it's a little bit
complicated<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.250> way<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> u<00:01:21.090> F

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
complicated the way I do it with a u F

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530 
complicated the way I do it with a u F
but<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.290> works<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.100> me<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.580> once<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> see

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
but it works out for me so once you see

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.410 
but it works out for me so once you see
that<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.290> case<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.850> set<00:01:27.299> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this algorithm I do the pull the D with

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.420 
this algorithm I do the pull the D with
this<00:02:03.090> ring<00:02:03.329> finger<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.079> also<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> D<00:02:04.829> prime<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this ring finger and also the D prime I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.429 
this ring finger and also the D prime I
push<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.020> slowly<00:02:07.290> just

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
push so I'm going to do it slowly just

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.119 
push so I'm going to do it slowly just
to<00:02:07.680> show<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.950> how<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> execute<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:08.970> algorithm

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.830 

just<00:02:13.129> like<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.459> now<00:02:13.909> just<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:14.329> with<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.659> RA

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
just like that now just like with the RA

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.770 
just like that now just like with the RA
pol<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.099> RV<00:02:16.519> also<00:02:16.939> has<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> set<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.480> headlights

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
pol the RV also has a set of headlights

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.720 
pol the RV also has a set of headlights
with<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.709> middle<00:02:18.920> piece<00:02:19.099> not<00:02:19.400> being<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
with the middle piece not being the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.000 
with the middle piece not being the
opposite<00:02:20.090> color<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.599> then<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> two<00:02:21.829> by<00:02:21.980> one

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
opposite color and then a two by one

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.619 
opposite color and then a two by one
block<00:02:22.459> either<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.120> left<00:02:23.150> or<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.569> right

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
block either on the left or the right

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.920 
block either on the left or the right
but<00:02:24.049> with<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.469> RB<00:02:24.859> it<00:02:25.129> is<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.670> left<00:02:25.939> so<00:02:26.719> au

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
but with the RB it is on the left so au

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
but with the RB it is on the left so au
F<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.769> case<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.280> very<00:02:28.370> similar<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.239> way

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
F with this case is very similar the way

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.210 
F with this case is very similar the way
you<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:30.049> this<00:02:30.230> normally<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.859> would<00:02:31.010> think<00:02:31.040> you

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
you do this normally you would think you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.470 
you do this normally you would think you
want<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.459> line<00:02:31.670> up<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> headlights<00:02:32.299> with

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
want to line up the headlights with

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.690 
want to line up the headlights with
their<00:02:32.659> color<00:02:32.870> but<00:02:33.590> actually<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.129> want<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.430> put

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
their color but actually you want to put

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.349 
their color but actually you want to put
them<00:02:34.879> one<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:36.170> prime<00:02:36.530> away<00:02:37.280> from<00:02:37.700> their<00:02:38.090> color

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
them one you prime away from their color

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.500 
them one you prime away from their color
so<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.349> headlights<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.639> block<00:02:40.879> are<00:02:41.150> both

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
so the headlights and the block are both

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.710 
so the headlights and the block are both
one<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.859> know<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.310> prime<00:02:43.670> away<00:02:44.060> from<00:02:44.269> them<00:02:44.480> or

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
one you know you prime away from them or

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.869 
one you know you prime away from them or
there<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.530> move<00:02:45.739> counterclockwise<00:02:46.069> away

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
there one move counterclockwise away

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.490 
there one move counterclockwise away
from<00:02:47.090> where<00:02:47.209> they<00:02:47.299> should<00:02:47.540> be<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.109> you<00:02:48.139> can<00:02:48.260> use

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
from where they should be so you can use

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.960 
from where they should be so you can use
that<00:02:48.650> information<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.459> couple<00:02:49.730> different

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
that information in a couple different

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.789 
that information in a couple different
ways<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.450> know<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.079> if<00:02:51.169> you<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:51.590> case

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
ways you know that if you have the case

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.250 
ways you know that if you have the case
like<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.370> whenever<00:02:53.180> you're<00:02:53.359> done<00:02:53.569> you're

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
like this whenever you're done you're

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.470 
like this whenever you're done you're
just<00:02:54.470> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.769> have<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.099> do<00:02:55.400> au<00:02:55.700> prime<00:02:58.480> like

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
just going to have to do au prime like

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.569 
just going to have to do au prime like
that<00:03:01.299> or<00:03:02.299> you<00:03:03.019> know<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.500> if<00:03:03.769> it's<00:03:03.980> like<00:03:04.220> this

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
that or you know that if it's like this

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.440 
that or you know that if it's like this
it<00:03:05.269> will<00:03:05.419> be<00:03:05.480> solved<00:03:06.109> when<00:03:06.799> you're<00:03:06.950> done<00:03:07.450> all

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
it will be solved when you're done all

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.670 
it will be solved when you're done all
right<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.659> now<00:03:08.989> let's<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.349> into<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
right and now let's get into the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
right and now let's get into the
algorithm<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.909> I<00:03:10.939> will<00:03:11.450> set<00:03:11.689> it<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.079> where

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
algorithm so I will set it up to where

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.589 
algorithm so I will set it up to where
it's<00:03:12.470> solved<00:03:12.980> at<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.159> end<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.669> no<00:03:13.700> au<00:03:14.060> F<00:03:14.329> and

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
it's solved at the end with no au F and

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.750 
it's solved at the end with no au F and
then<00:03:15.319> once<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.680> realize<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:16.489> this

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
then once you realize that you have this

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.879 
then once you realize that you have this
case<00:03:17.030> with<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> two<00:03:17.959> by<00:03:18.229> one<00:03:18.379> block<00:03:18.560> on<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
case with the two by one block on the

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.059 
case with the two by one block on the
left<00:03:18.919> you<00:03:19.909> want<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.389> algorithm<00:03:21.069> our

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
left you want to do this algorithm our

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.740 
left you want to do this algorithm our
prime<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:23.060> -<00:03:23.359> are<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.729> -<00:03:25.729> it'd<00:03:26.030> be<00:03:26.090> best<00:03:26.479> to<00:03:26.599> do

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
prime you - are you - it'd be best to do

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.270 
prime you - are you - it'd be best to do
a<00:03:26.780> double<00:03:27.019> flick<00:03:27.319> with<00:03:27.470> your<00:03:27.620> left<00:03:27.829> hand<00:03:28.010> there

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
a double flick with your left hand there

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.399 
a double flick with your left hand there
I'm<00:03:28.489> not<00:03:29.060> really<00:03:29.239> good<00:03:29.540> at<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.019> normally

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
I'm not really good at it so I normally

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.890 
I'm not really good at it so I normally
just<00:03:30.590> do<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.739> single<00:03:31.010> flick<00:03:31.280> but<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.299> helps<00:03:32.780> to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
just do a single flick but it helps to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.530 
just do a single flick but it helps to
do<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.139> double<00:03:33.409> flick<00:03:33.590> with<00:03:33.739> your<00:03:33.859> left<00:03:34.040> hand

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
do the double flick with your left hand

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
do the double flick with your left hand

F prime R - and that will solve your

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.960 
F prime R - and that will solve your
case<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.139> our<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.319> PLL<00:03:52.040> isn't<00:03:52.459> my<00:03:52.519> favorite

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
case so the our a PLL isn't my favorite

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.300 
case so the our a PLL isn't my favorite
but<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.780> can<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.199> fairly<00:03:54.379> quickly<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.129> I'm

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
but I can do it fairly quickly and I'm

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.550 
but I can do it fairly quickly and I'm
really<00:03:55.579> starting<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.389> RV<00:03:56.569> because

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
really starting to like the RV because

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.809 
really starting to like the RV because
