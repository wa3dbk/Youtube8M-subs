00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
ways you can do it you just roll it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
ways you can do it you just roll it
right<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> harder

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
right off that's going to make it harder

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
right off that's going to make it harder
to<00:01:13.200> put<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.830> us<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.130> we're<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.520> to

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
um you take the grips and you insert zip

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.810 
um you take the grips and you insert zip
tie<00:05:27.050> like<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.350> like<00:05:28.980> you<00:05:29.160> insert<00:05:29.460> all<00:05:29.640> of

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
tie like this like you insert all of

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.930 
tie like this like you insert all of
them<00:05:29.970> like<00:05:30.240> this<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:30.660> then<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:31.860> put<00:05:32.670> two<00:05:32.910> on

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
them like this and then you put two on

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.450 
them like this and then you put two on
one<00:05:33.210> side<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.720> two<00:05:33.870> on<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.050> other<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.560> then

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
one side and two on the other and then

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.740 
one side and two on the other and then
you<00:05:35.610> open<00:05:35.880> up<00:05:36.240> like<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:38.270> then<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:39.390> slide

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
you open up like so and then you slide

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.900 
you open up like so and then you slide
the<00:05:39.780> grip<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:41.100> slides<00:05:41.370> on<00:05:41.640> well

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
the grip on and it slides on well

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.360 
the grip on and it slides on well
because<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:42.720> zip<00:05:42.900> ties<00:05:43.080> this<00:05:43.830> actually<00:05:44.220> works

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
because the zip ties this actually works

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.580 
because the zip ties this actually works
pretty<00:05:44.430> well<00:05:44.610> I've<00:05:45.090> never<00:05:45.240> done<00:05:45.360> this<00:05:45.570> but<00:05:46.380> it

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
pretty well I've never done this but it

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.550 
pretty well I've never done this but it
does<00:05:46.740> work<00:05:46.890> quite<00:05:47.160> well<00:05:47.360> let<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.480> record<00:05:48.780> show

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.420 

so<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:52.650> just<00:05:52.800> wiggle<00:05:52.919> it<00:05:53.069> right<00:05:53.189> on<00:05:53.310> it

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
so you just wiggle it right on it

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.679 
so you just wiggle it right on it
Wiggles<00:05:53.699> a<00:05:53.729> lot<00:05:53.879> easier<00:05:54.180> than<00:05:54.300> it<00:05:54.419> would<00:05:54.569> if

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
Wiggles a lot easier than it would if

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:55.640 
Wiggles a lot easier than it would if
the<00:05:54.719> zip<00:05:54.960> ties<00:05:55.110> weren't<00:05:55.319> in<00:05:55.409> there

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
the zip ties weren't in there

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.230 
the zip ties weren't in there
you<00:05:55.800> get<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:55.979> nice<00:05:56.159> and<00:05:56.189> flush<00:05:56.490> on<00:05:56.639> and<00:05:56.879> usually

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
you get it nice and flush on and usually

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.219 
you get it nice and flush on and usually
I<00:05:57.270> like<00:05:57.389> to<00:05:57.449> leave<00:05:57.659> a<00:05:57.689> little<00:05:57.900> bit<00:05:58.080> of<00:05:58.139> a
