downsized in just a few years is
financial<00:00:37.320> problems<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.070> some<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
financial problems and so some of the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
financial problems and so some of the
reasons<00:00:39.059> leading<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.829> are

what<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.510> her<00:01:12.750> reasons

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
what do you think about her reasons

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.039 
what do you think about her reasons
there<00:01:13.470> well<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.729> they're<00:01:15.060> all<00:01:15.210> valid<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
there well i think they're all valid in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
there well i think they're all valid in
that<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.619> probably<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.490> case<00:01:17.729> i<00:01:18.060> mean

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that that's probably the case i mean

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
that that's probably the case i mean
that's<00:01:18.390> probably<00:01:18.570> true<00:01:18.990> all<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.380> these<00:01:19.590> things

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that's probably true all of these things

that's probably true all of these things
are<00:01:19.950> true<00:01:20.009> i'll<00:01:20.400> start<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> last<00:01:21.540> part

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
are true i'll start with the last part

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
are true i'll start with the last part
which<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.200> irrational<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> university's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

which is irrational for the university's
existence<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.540> expected<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.470> challenged

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
existence is expected to be challenged

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.770 
existence is expected to be challenged
since<00:01:26.610> african-american<00:01:27.299> students<00:01:27.630> can

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780

attend<00:01:28.080> any<00:01:28.290> college<00:01:28.770> university<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.430> actually

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
attend any college university i actually

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
attend any college university i actually
i<00:01:30.210> didn't<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.020> black<00:01:31.259> college<00:01:31.650> experience

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
i didn't have a black college experience

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.149 
i didn't have a black college experience
but<00:01:32.369> i<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.970> pros<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.159> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
but i think there are pros to that and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.240 
but i think there are pros to that and
that<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.200> being<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.070> go

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that want one of them being that you go

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.620 
that want one of them being that you go
to<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.400> school<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.420> other

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
to a school where you're not the other

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
right you're not a minority for the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.069 
right you're not a minority for the
first<00:01:41.700> time<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.060> your<00:01:42.119> life<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.600> most<00:01:42.689> people

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
first time in your life for most people

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
first time in your life for most people
i<00:01:43.350> went<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> school<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.579> was

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
i went to a school that was

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
i went to a school that was
predominantly<00:01:45.420> white<00:01:45.689> I've<00:01:46.020> always<00:01:46.530> actually

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
predominantly white I've always actually

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
predominantly white I've always actually
gone<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> school<00:01:47.880> that's<00:01:48.149> been

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
gone to a school that's been

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990 
gone to a school that's been
predominantly<00:01:49.290> white<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.460> wonder<00:01:50.820> what

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
predominantly white so I do wonder what

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760 
predominantly white so I do wonder what
the<00:01:51.329> experience<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.110> been<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the experience would have been like if I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
the experience would have been like if I
was<00:01:52.979> around<00:01:53.369> people<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:53.939> looked<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.720> like

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
was around people that looked more like

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920 
was around people that looked more like
me<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.280> i<00:01:56.520> also<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.719> into

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
me right so then i also want to get into

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.920 
me right so then i also want to get into
uh<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.270> seems<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> lot

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
uh the all that there seems to be a lot

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
uh the all that there seems to be a lot
of<00:02:00.990> waste<00:02:01.409> at<00:02:01.740> least<00:02:01.920> according<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.549> what

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
of waste at least according to what

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.730 
of waste at least according to what
she's<00:02:03.420> saying<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.020> been<00:02:04.170> backed<00:02:04.469> by

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
she's saying and it's been backed by

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.180 
she's saying and it's been backed by
numbers<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.479> faculty<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.530> student<00:02:07.560> ratio

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
numbers the the faculty to student ratio

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.410 
numbers the the faculty to student ratio
with<00:02:08.700> 221<00:02:09.679> yeah<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.370> definitely<00:02:11.670> stands<00:02:12.180> out

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
with 221 yeah that definitely stands out

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.740 
with 221 yeah that definitely stands out
although<00:02:12.840> i<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
although i think that there's a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.870 
although i think that there's a
definite<00:02:14.230> pros<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.580> want<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
definite pros to that like you want to

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.420 
definite pros to that like you want to
have<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> lot<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.330> that's<00:02:16.960> too<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:17.410> maybe<00:02:18.160> too

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
have a lot of that's too much maybe too

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.640 
have a lot of that's too much maybe too
much<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.820> mean<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.450> talk<00:02:19.630> about<00:02:19.780> classrooms

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
much I mean we we talk about classrooms

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.270 
much I mean we we talk about classrooms
like<00:02:21.250> elementary<00:02:21.820> classrooms<00:02:22.480> having<00:02:22.980> 24<00:02:23.980> 30

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
like elementary classrooms having 24 30

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.910 
like elementary classrooms having 24 30
students<00:02:24.760> per<00:02:25.300> teacher<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
students per teacher that on the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.430 
students per teacher that on the
opposite<00:02:27.520> extreme<00:02:27.610> but<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.450> college<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.410> know

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
opposite extreme but in college you know

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.650 
opposite extreme but in college you know
you<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.520> actually<00:02:30.850> get<00:02:31.060> away<00:02:31.360> with

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
you at you can actually get away with

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.090 
you at you can actually get away with
less<00:02:32.080> teachers<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.860> would<00:02:33.010> in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
less teachers and you would in

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.980 
less teachers and you would in
elementary<00:02:33.730> schools<00:02:34.060> because<00:02:34.570> we're<00:02:34.720> adults

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
elementary schools because we're adults

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.840 
elementary schools because we're adults
and<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.350> know<00:02:35.709> we're<00:02:35.890> there<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.070> learn<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.760> as

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
and we know we're there to learn and as

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.670 
and we know we're there to learn and as
long<00:02:37.030> as<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.480> are<00:02:37.900> eager<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.650> enthusiastic

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
long as you are eager and enthusiastic

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680 
long as you are eager and enthusiastic
like<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.640> should<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.150> little<00:02:40.360> bit<00:02:40.540> easier

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
like it should be a little bit easier

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.449 
like it should be a little bit easier
yeah<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.380> mean<00:02:41.440> I've<00:02:41.590> had<00:02:41.709> classes<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.130> three

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
yeah I mean I've had classes with three

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.460 
yeah I mean I've had classes with three
four<00:02:42.670> five<00:02:42.820> hundred<00:02:43.120> people<00:02:43.240> that's<00:02:43.810> insane

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
four five hundred people that's insane

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.199 
four five hundred people that's insane
yes<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.070> did<00:02:45.190> send<00:02:45.520> out<00:02:45.670> they<00:02:45.940> might<00:02:46.060> be

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
yes that did send out they might be

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.580 
yes that did send out they might be
spending<00:02:46.510> too<00:02:46.630> much<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:46.989> their<00:02:47.170> employees

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
spending too much on their employees

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.680 
spending too much on their employees
yeah<00:02:48.489> i<00:02:48.520> talked<00:02:49.000> about<00:02:49.030> they've<00:02:49.330> recently

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
yeah i talked about they've recently

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.570 
yeah i talked about they've recently
tried<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.230> make<00:02:50.440> their<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.800> dorms<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.459> their

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
tried to make their like dorms and their

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.920 
tried to make their like dorms and their
dining<00:02:51.850> halls<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.180> stuff<00:02:52.239> more<00:02:52.510> appealing<00:02:52.750> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
dining halls and stuff more appealing to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.970 
dining halls and stuff more appealing to
get<00:02:53.050> more<00:02:53.170> students<00:02:53.410> wanna<00:02:53.560> go<00:02:53.709> there<00:02:53.890> but

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
get more students wanna go there but

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.290 
get more students wanna go there but
obviously<00:02:54.310> those<00:02:54.459> costs<00:02:54.730> associated<00:02:55.030> with

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
obviously those costs associated with

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.420 
obviously those costs associated with
that<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:55.570> well<00:02:55.600> right<00:02:56.140> i<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.800> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
that as well right i think the the the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.090 
that as well right i think the the the
larger<00:02:57.880> problem<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.930> call<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.709> way<00:03:00.040> too

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
larger problem is that call just way too

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.520 
larger problem is that call just way too
expensive<00:03:00.459> it's<00:03:01.150> way<00:03:01.390> too<00:03:01.420> expensive<00:03:01.660> i<00:03:02.320> mean

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
expensive it's way too expensive i mean

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.440 
expensive it's way too expensive i mean
i<00:03:02.739> went<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> state<00:03:03.370> college<00:03:03.730> my<00:03:03.880> first<00:03:04.090> year

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
i went to a state college my first year

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.880 
i went to a state college my first year
I<00:03:04.510> thought<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.989> think<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.350> was<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.500> best

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
I thought I think that was the best

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.430 
I thought I think that was the best
decision<00:03:06.070> ever<00:03:06.550> because<00:03:07.239> my<00:03:07.510> loans<00:03:08.170> have<00:03:08.380> been

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
decision ever because my loans have been

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.590 
decision ever because my loans have been
reduced<00:03:08.950> by<00:03:09.160> intact<00:03:09.700> by<00:03:10.030> twenty<00:03:10.420> five<00:03:10.570> percent

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
reduced by intact by twenty five percent

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.190 
reduced by intact by twenty five percent
right<00:03:11.489> yes<00:03:12.489> well<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.180> mean<00:03:13.360> if<00:03:13.480> I'd<00:03:13.630> gone<00:03:13.810> for

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
right yes well I mean if I'd gone for

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.930 
right yes well I mean if I'd gone for
years<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.470> Emerson<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.280> would<00:03:15.459> have<00:03:15.550> been<00:03:15.700> a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
years to Emerson it would have been a

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.110 
years to Emerson it would have been a
lot<00:03:16.060> more<00:03:16.120> expensive<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.799> mean<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.430> get<00:03:19.090> it

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
lot more expensive so I I mean I get it

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.509 
lot more expensive so I I mean I get it
it's<00:03:19.540> it's<00:03:19.870> probably<00:03:20.320> more<00:03:20.650> for<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.220> black

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
it's it's probably more for the black

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.390 
it's it's probably more for the black
elite<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.450> can<00:03:22.600> afford<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.110> have<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:24.310> know

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
elite that can afford to have you know

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.120 
elite that can afford to have you know
25,000<00:03:25.299> 30,000<00:03:25.900> dollar<00:03:26.019> tuition<00:03:26.650> yeah<00:03:26.920> I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
25,000 30,000 dollar tuition yeah I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.620 
25,000 30,000 dollar tuition yeah I
don't<00:03:27.340> know<00:03:27.549> if<00:03:27.730> there's<00:03:27.940> much<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.330> can<00:03:28.390> do

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
don't know if there's much they can do

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.210 
don't know if there's much they can do
about<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.900> except<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.410> maybe<00:03:29.650> try<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.950> help

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
about that except for maybe try to help

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220 
about that except for maybe try to help
students<00:03:30.610> out<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:30.970> financial<00:03:31.450> aid<00:03:31.690> yeah

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
students out with financial aid yeah

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.860 
students out with financial aid yeah
maybe<00:03:32.500> um<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.580> obviously<00:03:34.299> did<00:03:34.570> not<00:03:34.600> go<00:03:34.810> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
maybe um I I obviously did not go to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.090 
maybe um I I obviously did not go to
historically<00:03:35.290> by<00:03:35.470> ecology<00:03:35.860> might<00:03:35.980> have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
historically by ecology might have

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.060 
historically by ecology might have
guessed<00:03:36.220> uh<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.239> i<00:03:37.510> got<00:03:37.690> i<00:03:37.720> heard<00:03:38.230> yet<00:03:38.500> but

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
guessed uh and I i got i heard yet but

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.229 
guessed uh and I i got i heard yet but
we've<00:03:39.190> gotten<00:03:39.459> videos<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.940> past<00:03:40.150> from

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
we've gotten videos the past from

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.250 
we've gotten videos the past from
students<00:03:40.660> who<00:03:40.690> talked<00:03:40.900> about<00:03:41.110> their

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
students who talked about their

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.539 
students who talked about their
experience<00:03:41.650> there<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.010> did<00:03:42.220> have<00:03:42.340> very

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
experience there and they did have very

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.620 
experience there and they did have very
good<00:03:42.700> experience<00:03:42.820> i<00:03:43.180> think<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:43.480> there's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
good experience i think that there's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.390 
good experience i think that there's
totally<00:03:43.989> value<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:44.860> especially

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
totally value to that and so especially

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.270 
totally value to that and so especially
on<00:03:46.150> uh<00:03:46.720> Howard<00:03:47.290> University<00:03:47.829> one<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.190> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
on uh Howard University one of the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.800 
on uh Howard University one of the
school's<00:03:48.670> been<00:03:48.850> around<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.239> long<00:03:49.269> it's<00:03:49.660> like<00:03:49.720> a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
school's been around so long it's like a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.380 
school's been around so long it's like a
hundred<00:03:49.989> fifty<00:03:50.440> years<00:03:50.709> old<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.130> think<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.430> 1867

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
hundred fifty years old I think I 1867

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.170 
hundred fifty years old I think I 1867
started<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.019> uh<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.950> from<00:03:54.340> its<00:03:54.610> up<00:03:54.880> from<00:03:55.060> its

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
started in uh and from its up from its

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.850 
started in uh and from its up from its
origin<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.870> allowed<00:03:56.079> people<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.500> all<00:03:56.650> races

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
origin it allowed people of all races

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.039 
origin it allowed people of all races
and<00:03:57.160> both<00:03:57.519> genders<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.180> it's<00:03:58.329> been<00:03:58.480> incredibly

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
and both genders so it's been incredibly

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.860 
and both genders so it's been incredibly
tolerant<00:03:59.350> open<00:03:59.920> since<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.519> began<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.390> long<00:04:01.810> time

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
tolerant open since it began a long time

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.600 
tolerant open since it began a long time
ago<00:04:02.260> we're<00:04:02.590> talking<00:04:02.829> about<00:04:03.010> like<00:04:03.190> shortly

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
ago we're talking about like shortly

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.539 
ago we're talking about like shortly
after<00:04:03.850> reconstruction<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.920> would<00:04:06.070> it

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
after reconstruction and so it would it

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.280 
after reconstruction and so it would it
would<00:04:06.610> be<00:04:06.790> extremely<00:04:07.120> unfortunate<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:08.019> lose

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
would be extremely unfortunate to lose

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.050 
would be extremely unfortunate to lose
that<00:04:08.320> in<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:08.890> modern<00:04:09.040> era<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.430> think<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.850> think

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
that in the modern era I think I think

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.370 
that in the modern era I think I think
that<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:10.239> some<00:04:10.660> students<00:04:10.959> would<00:04:11.049> be<00:04:11.110> losing

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
that that some students would be losing

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.110 
that that some students would be losing
out<00:04:11.440> on<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.590> great<00:04:11.799> experience<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.370> agree<00:04:12.790> now

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
out on a great experience I agree now

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.050 
out on a great experience I agree now
