00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.010
 always remember how much I remember myself 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.199
 treat what we do fast but 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.230
 balanced decision making 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.750
 so I understand this job 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.559
 that much depends on my decisions 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.559
 and it inspires 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.010
 every time after the change I feel 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.140
 fatigue but it is pleasant fatigue 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.920
 but the soul peace and joy of quality 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 work performed 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 dozens of employees 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.590
 do you have tens of thousands of trains 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.750
 passengers and thousands of tons of cargo and you 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340
 responsible for their safe traffic and 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.240
 timely arrival at point 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.310
 destination the fact is that for iron 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.799
 roads 5 over is not just a lot of it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.810
 global value if some kind of train 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.810
 seemingly only 5 minutes late 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.030
 before the approved scheme is necessary 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.149
 change the dispatcher is such a commander 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.130
 know how the movies show sits a 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.170
 over the card thinks different 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.310
 options when goals get here 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.310
 something like this and we have 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.900
 you need to be as moderate as possible if 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.820
 dispatcher at any level will give 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.000
 the team is inaccurate and uncertain then 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 subordinate 1 boss will also be 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.040
 doubt not to get lost 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.290
 dispatcher should inspire giving 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.060
 life of the whole structure 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:23.590
 turn rails station train sleepers 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:25.450
 into a single pulsating organism to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.129
 you need to become a dispatcher first 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.890
 work as they say in the field 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.599
 the station attendant for example and then 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.049
 do an internship near an experienced 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.049
 knitting needle 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.550
 minimum banners and maximum 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.420
 the result is the basic principle of work 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.260
 dispatcher 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.710
 but the most important thing is strict compliance 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.030
 train safety 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.800
 prompt adoption of the only true 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.850
 solutions is precisely this main principle 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.850
 work dispatcher 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.190
 go fuck 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.110
 simple situation and rustle to withstand 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.120
 free time to go 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.709
 can now hold the rest of the compositions 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.080
 The easiest solution is 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.160
 send the belt to the side path but before 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.170
 need to calculate 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.120
 more then the opportunity to release it 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.000
 back or the movement of other trains for 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.860
 its fruit is like a trap and what then 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.769
 get a mystery dispatcher started me 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.319
 at 59 on the ride and spent only 58 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.340
 but you could not bring such of course 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.920
 situations should not 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.700
 dispatcher or was a god checking and 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.950
 the detail is bad but exactly these thanks 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.410
 the work of the goods never leaves naked 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.110
 one simple but very important thought 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.600
 there is a way out of any situation and how 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.090
 the rule is not one the most difficult life 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.040
 problem you can find a solution to train 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.250
 dispatcher is so very big hat 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.000
 the relay moves after a year or two of care 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.000
 executive position 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.940
 I think that in retirement I will be surrounded 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.890
 from the dispatch service in this 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.870
 work there is one very important linen 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.380
 the moment you see the result boldly there 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.820
 every day of course this job requires 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.130
 maximum return 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.630
 but I get a decent salary from him 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.580
 cavity social package 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.010
 medical leave paid 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:25.330
 insurance I know what to expect from what 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.640
 are everything could be good 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.320
 dispatchers need to respect time always 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.270
 remember that every minute of yours 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.080
 work shifts are reflected throughout 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.960
 railways 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.420
 every minute and every word needs to be 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.730
 bold purposeful responsible 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.260
 resolute these qualities to you constantly 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.790
 raising need to be optimistic because 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.460
 what to do whatever 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.780
 important and big deal is possible only with 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.150
 positive attitude
