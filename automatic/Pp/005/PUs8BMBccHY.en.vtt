00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 There is cause for joy than mine 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.810
 study mate and knife or have 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.059
 now after a long search finally a job 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.809
 or a permanent position found that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.610
 is celebrated 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.019
 but I thought about it but I like it 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.759
 to defer him even as a canister 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 of course a bottle of prosecco 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.470
 but to trigger a little something 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 the maker of this I have me 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.189
 I think I'll do two videos once 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.269
 for her and others and what you do about it 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 I just needed you 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.580
 and I would suggest 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.439
 Let's just start with one 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.239
 sweet little thing for the nerves 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.309
 you need this first label that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.230
 could create in the computer or her 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.660
 to write next handwritten and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.710
 an empty medication bottle shortly 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.510
 rinse out first 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 I had tablets here before 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.469
 stomach complaints there but also known 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.780
 take a surfaces for cough syrup 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 as long as that plays well before and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.100
 After that, it really dries out well 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 No matter what's on it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 that little label was what they did before 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 printed or labeled and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.859
 then only the content counts for the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.719
 Content could never boot with small ones 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.460
 or you can take tecdax scores 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.090
 fresh breath is really complete 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 leave 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.689
 i take chocolate a girlfriend 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 Programming chocolate so get 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.040
 the two chocolate I have two 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 Small who made the lid on it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.619
 and already the first one would be finished 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.810
 I'm super simple and a total 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 funny gift idea is under advantage 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 also busy again and again 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 So stop your girlfriend or 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 Friend always quite right 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.200
 that means we always come with great 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.670
 busen continue in the job so I have 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.579
 I considered a second gift 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.350
 bausatz for a larger bosom the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.000
 You can create an envelope on the computer 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 or does the handwritten ride that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 It's up to you what each one does 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.840
 case required is the kit of two 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 Balloons insists you grab these two 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.979
 then either a transparent cover purely 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.590
 mapping or you can paper I take 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.990
 have this made her right in the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 background and I have the in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.020
 cut the middle and glue it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.509
 now simply mirrored 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490
 on top of each other the upper section where the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810
 pure balloons 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.880
 that I am free but the other three 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.310
 I just have you with each other 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.349
 the edges are now clearly off 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.720
 the top portion, for example, as 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.190
 a lot of paper just gets away and that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.200
 Edges also become neat 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.520
 isolated 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.800
 now the two balloons can do it 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.870
 pack and then we're done 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.640
 recognized the number balloons as I said 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.260
 but like purely in a transparent envelope 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.760
 do this if their paper is not reasonably 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.040
 have it out there 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.140
 the label or the one around black with fr 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 have tinkered easy to fold with it 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.400
 and the excess run easily 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.620
 cut away then take this one 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.230
 envelope and tackert go either on 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.910
 your transparent cover on it or on the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.430
 machine just tinkered together 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.709
 so it's looking for you and already 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.049
 the gift would be ready this is one 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.340
 she gets super funny gift idea 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.170
 A buddy seems to come too 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.640
 happy at men totally funny 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.630
 I just can not decide 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.310
 I'll probably do two 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.170
 kits and gives simply stay 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.459
 I am convinced the two were me 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.130
 I am also convinced with yours 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.959
 friends very well kubica was from that 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.340

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.420
