00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740 

it's<00:01:17.320> just<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.710> quick<00:01:17.950> heads-up<00:01:18.510> so<00:01:19.510> what's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
it's just a quick heads-up so what's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
it's just a quick heads-up so what's
happening<00:01:20.140> inside<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.740> riser<00:01:20.950> tube<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.590> is

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
happening inside the riser tube this is

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.230 
happening inside the riser tube this is
with<00:01:23.979> control<00:01:24.670> pieces<00:01:26.160> two<00:01:27.160> plates<00:01:27.580> that's<00:01:28.090> at

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
with control pieces two plates that's at

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.050 
with control pieces two plates that's at
an<00:01:28.390> angle<00:01:28.690> of<00:01:28.780> 45<00:01:29.320> degrees<00:01:29.770> inside<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.790> tube

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
an angle of 45 degrees inside the tube

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.800 
an angle of 45 degrees inside the tube
and<00:01:31.830> that's<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.160> vortex<00:01:33.760> effect<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.630> get

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
and that's the vortex effect you get

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.180 
and that's the vortex effect you get
which<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:36.460> powerful<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:37.240> have<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.690> admit

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
which is really powerful I have to admit

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.370 
which is really powerful I have to admit
when<00:01:39.190> I<00:01:39.310> first<00:01:39.580> saw<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.240> using<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:41.080> didn't

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
when I first saw and using this I didn't

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.030 
when I first saw and using this I didn't
think<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.860> felt<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.250> was<00:01:42.310> more<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:44.040> let's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
think I felt it was more of a and let's

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.690 
think I felt it was more of a and let's
say<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.580> swirl<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:47.830> actually<00:01:48.040> quite<00:01:48.280> a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
say a swirl but it is actually quite a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:04.859 
say a swirl but it is actually quite a
powerful<00:01:49.240> vortex<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:59.440> that's<00:01:59.649> it<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
powerful vortex so that's it that's the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.719 
powerful vortex so that's it that's the
extension<00:02:05.320> piece<00:02:05.770> I've<00:02:06.009> just<00:02:06.190> added<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
extension piece I've just added to the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.400 
extension piece I've just added to the
riser<00:02:06.940> tube<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.820> when<00:02:10.709> fit<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.860> next<00:02:12.160> bit

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
riser tube so that when fit the next bit

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.810 
riser tube so that when fit the next bit
it<00:02:14.410> will<00:02:14.590> all<00:02:14.709> work<00:02:19.950> okay<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.010> I've<00:02:21.430> got<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
it will all work okay so I've got to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.580 
it will all work okay so I've got to
where<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.299> wanted<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.320> be<00:02:23.620> with<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.010> thing<00:02:24.310> now

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
where I wanted to be with this thing now

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.180 
where I wanted to be with this thing now
took<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.950> original<00:02:27.670> top<00:02:27.910> off<00:02:28.739> I've<00:02:29.739> replaced

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
took the original top off I've replaced

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.270 
took the original top off I've replaced
it<00:02:30.519> with<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.239> boiler<00:02:32.019> bellboy<00:02:32.590> liability

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it with the boiler bellboy liability

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.130 
it with the boiler bellboy liability
which<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.330> again<00:02:35.019> two<00:02:35.530> bottles<00:02:36.540> welded<00:02:37.540> one

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
which is again two bottles welded one

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
which is again two bottles welded one
inside<00:02:38.560> piece<00:02:38.799> left<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> plate<00:02:39.549> around

the bottom and that's filled abortive is
about<00:02:42.820> an<00:02:43.000> inch<00:02:43.150> gap<00:02:43.590> around<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.860> inside<00:02:46.470> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
about an inch gap around the inside and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.009 
about an inch gap around the inside and
it's<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.980> started<00:02:48.519> boiling

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.949 

clean<00:02:53.019> burn<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.769> see<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.840> Falcom<00:02:55.840> all

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
clean burn you can see that Falcom all

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:05.030 
clean burn you can see that Falcom all
the<00:02:56.079> steam<00:02:56.349> coming<00:02:56.739> out<00:03:01.980> burns<00:03:02.980> very<00:03:03.250> clean

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the steam coming out burns very clean

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.670 
the steam coming out burns very clean
animals<00:03:06.040> very<00:03:06.459> little<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.200> way<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.379> heat

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
animals very little in the way of heat

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.449 
animals very little in the way of heat
coming<00:03:09.040> out<00:03:09.129> of<00:03:09.190> there<00:03:13.799> this<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:14.980> taken

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
coming out of there this is taken

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.460 
coming out of there this is taken
literally<00:03:15.909> five<00:03:16.629> minutes<00:03:16.859> start<00:03:17.859> boiling

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
literally five minutes start boiling

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:34.949 
literally five minutes start boiling
this<00:03:20.470> thing<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:32.049> all<00:03:32.200> its<00:03:32.470> fueled<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.519> was<00:03:34.269> two

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
this thing and all its fueled it was two

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.270 
this thing and all its fueled it was two
pieces<00:03:35.409> of<00:03:35.470> 3b<00:03:35.859> -<00:03:36.069> about<00:03:36.459> 18<00:03:36.940> inches<00:03:37.150> long<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
pieces of 3b - about 18 inches long and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.449 
pieces of 3b - about 18 inches long and
you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.670> see<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.209> they<00:03:40.680> actually<00:03:41.680> are<00:03:42.190> still

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
you can see that they actually are still

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.509 
you can see that they actually are still
a<00:03:42.489> lot<00:03:42.639> of<00:03:42.670> fear<00:03:43.180> where<00:03:43.980> they<00:03:44.980> literally

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
a lot of fear where they literally

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.390 
a lot of fear where they literally
started<00:03:46.359> 5<00:03:46.629> minutes<00:03:46.659> of<00:03:47.139> old<00:03:47.319> appeal<00:03:47.709> stick<00:03:48.159> I

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
started 5 minutes of old appeal stick I

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.379 
started 5 minutes of old appeal stick I
just<00:03:49.269> got<00:03:49.480> burning<00:03:50.519> water<00:03:51.519> got<00:03:51.879> up<00:03:51.909> to<00:03:52.150> jump

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
just got burning water got up to jump

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:58.830 
just got burning water got up to jump
into<00:03:52.569> your<00:03:52.840> really<00:03:53.170> quickly<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.840> quite

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840

into your really quickly so quite
pleased<00:03:59.199> the<00:03:59.440> way<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.739> Jackie<00:04:00.010> performed<00:04:00.639> on

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
pleased the way the Jackie performed on

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.939 
pleased the way the Jackie performed on
this<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:04.060> differences<00:04:04.629> are<00:04:04.750> made<00:04:04.959> up<00:04:05.139> I've

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
this the differences are made up I've

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:11.699 
this the differences are made up I've
put<00:04:06.280> two<00:04:06.609> of<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:08.730> plates<00:04:09.900> two<00:04:10.900> sets<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.410> plates

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
put two of the plates two sets of plates

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.599 
put two of the plates two sets of plates
inside<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.489> riser<00:04:12.730> tube<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:15.250> try<00:04:15.489> and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
inside the riser tube to try and

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.819 
inside the riser tube to try and
increase<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:15.970> vortex<00:04:16.660> port<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.229> really<00:04:17.709> all

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
increase the vortex port and really all

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.189 
increase the vortex port and really all
it<00:04:18.039> did<00:04:18.220> was<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.729> kind<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.239> slowed<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.810> gases

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
it did was it kind of slowed the gases

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.200 
it did was it kind of slowed the gases
down<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.799> was<00:04:20.889> too<00:04:21.099> much<00:04:21.220> restriction<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
down it was too much restriction in the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.510 
down it was too much restriction in the
riser<00:04:22.449> so<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.320> took<00:04:23.560> one<00:04:23.770> out<00:04:23.949> I<00:04:24.099> left<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.400> one

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
riser so I took one out I left the one

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.370 
riser so I took one out I left the one
at<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.699> bottom<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.270> it's<00:04:26.020> working

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
at the bottom and it's working

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.689 
at the bottom and it's working
beautifully<00:04:26.590> now<00:04:27.510> I've<00:04:28.510> got<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.840> two<00:04:29.699> there

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
beautifully now I've got the two there

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.890 
beautifully now I've got the two there
feeds<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.479> side<00:04:31.720> there<00:04:33.150> there's<00:04:34.150> one<00:04:34.750> on

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
feeds on the side there there's one on

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.570 

it's<00:05:12.280> work<00:05:12.720> fantastically<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:14.190> got<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.310> up<00:05:15.460> to

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
it's work fantastically I got it up to

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.720 
it's work fantastically I got it up to
600<00:05:18.580> degrees<00:05:18.940> last<00:05:19.510> night<00:05:20.010> with<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.160> changes

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
600 degrees last night with the changes

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.990 
600 degrees last night with the changes
with<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.120> vortex<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:23.370> with<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.520> secondary

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
with the vortex and with the secondary

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.650 
with the vortex and with the secondary
air<00:05:25.800> whereas<00:05:26.800> before<00:05:27.190> without<00:05:27.610> them<00:05:27.880> I've

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
air whereas before without them I've

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.420 
air whereas before without them I've
achieved<00:05:28.840> all<00:05:29.290> could<00:05:29.530> achieve<00:05:29.620> was<00:05:29.950> 400

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
achieved all could achieve was 400

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.960 
achieved all could achieve was 400
degrees

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.820 

so<00:05:35.510> there<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.870> is<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:35.990> know<00:05:36.170> that<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.620> now<00:05:36.800> know

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
so there it is I know that I now know

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.330 
so there it is I know that I now know
the<00:05:37.190> vial<00:05:37.430> is<00:05:37.610> successful<00:05:41.680> going<00:05:42.680> mental<00:05:42.920> now

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
the vial is successful going mental now

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.390 
the vial is successful going mental now
huh<00:05:47.290> if<00:05:48.290> that<00:05:48.470> was<00:05:48.620> connected<00:05:49.070> up<00:05:49.160> to<00:05:49.310> my

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
huh if that was connected up to my

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.290 
huh if that was connected up to my
little<00:05:49.640> tank<00:05:51.160> there'd<00:05:52.160> be<00:05:52.640> a<00:05:52.670> really<00:05:53.180> good

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
little tank there'd be a really good

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.510 
little tank there'd be a really good
flow<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:53.750> water<00:05:53.900> moving<00:05:54.350> through<00:05:54.470> that<00:05:54.740> now<00:05:55.100> it

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
flow of water moving through that now it

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.720 
flow of water moving through that now it
would<00:05:55.760> have<00:05:56.200> eaten<00:05:57.200> up<00:05:57.290> much<00:05:57.530> faster<00:05:57.830> in<00:05:58.580> the

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
would have eaten up much faster in the

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.500 
would have eaten up much faster in the
previous<00:05:59.240> set<00:05:59.930> up<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.670> think<00:06:01.670> because<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.300> boil

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
previous set up I think because the boil

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.380 
previous set up I think because the boil
is<00:06:02.720> now<00:06:02.900> contained<00:06:05.740> as<00:06:06.740> part<00:06:07.310> of<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.760> stalled

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
is now contained as part of the stalled

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.820 
is now contained as part of the stalled
body<00:06:08.660> that<00:06:09.170> heats<00:06:09.410> inside<00:06:09.890> is<00:06:10.100> much<00:06:10.400> greater

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
body that heats inside is much greater

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.970 
body that heats inside is much greater
and<00:06:12.830> obviously<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:14.000> outside<00:06:14.450> of<00:06:14.660> that<00:06:14.780> jacket

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.910

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
hot pepper oil intern pitcher yeah since

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.950 
hot pepper oil intern pitcher yeah since
I<00:06:25.040> when<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.370> put<00:06:25.580> the<00:06:25.670> rise<00:06:25.880> II<00:06:25.910> the<00:06:26.600> rise<00:06:26.780> of

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
I when I put the rise II the rise of

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.030 
I when I put the rise II the rise of
changes<00:06:27.440> in<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.860> vortex<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.550> secondary<00:06:29.090> air

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
changes in the vortex and secondary air

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.250 
changes in the vortex and secondary air
