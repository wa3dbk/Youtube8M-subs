it's whoops here we go
the<00:00:17.310> design<00:00:17.699> theory<00:00:18.150> paper<00:00:18.560> we<00:00:19.560> need<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> piece

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the design theory paper we need a piece

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.980 
the design theory paper we need a piece
it<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.270> nine<00:00:21.930> by<00:00:22.380> three<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> quarter<00:00:23.990> so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it is nine by three and a quarter so

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.490 
it is nine by three and a quarter so
nine<00:00:25.289> by<00:00:25.710> three<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> quarter<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:28.140> one

two and a half it doesn't matter really
and<00:00:39.300> remember<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.260> design<00:00:41.040> Theory<00:00:41.430> paper

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and remember with design Theory paper

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.690 
and remember with design Theory paper
I<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.840> heard<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.530> almost<00:00:43.710> went<00:00:44.129> through<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
after you fold it go at four and a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.569 
after you fold it go at four and a
quarter<00:00:53.719> very<00:00:54.719> soft

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
little pouch and then for the answer for

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.649 
little pouch and then for the answer for
this<00:01:25.939> your<00:01:26.939> piece<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.610> three<00:01:29.610> by<00:01:30.119> three

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
this your piece it's a three by three

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.130 
this your piece it's a three by three
and<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.890> remember<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.930> three<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and at if I remember right three and a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.590 
and at if I remember right three and a
half<00:01:34.369> by<00:01:35.369> three<00:01:35.400> correct

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
half by three correct

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530 
half by three correct
so<00:01:37.320> three<00:01:37.740> by<00:01:37.979> three<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.520> half<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:39.210> using

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so three by three and a half I'm using

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.620 
so three by three and a half I'm using
this<00:01:39.900> punch<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:41.060> it's<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.360> available

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
this punch here it's not available

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
this punch here it's not available
anymore<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.680> still<00:01:44.479> add<00:01:45.479> them<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.140> clearance

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
anymore I still add them on clearance

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.740 
anymore I still add them on clearance
rack<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.610> sure<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.329> still<00:01:48.509> there

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
rack I'm not sure if it's still there

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.929 
rack I'm not sure if it's still there
here<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.710> put<00:01:52.920> my<00:01:53.189> gift<00:01:53.820> card

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
here we go that's to put my gift card

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.950 
here we go that's to put my gift card
and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.710> use<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:57.619> pad<00:01:58.619> punch<00:01:59.009> put<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.119> top<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and then I use my pad punch put on top I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.800 
and then I use my pad punch put on top I
pre<00:02:01.860> punch<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.670> try<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> speed<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
pre punch that to try to speed up the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.219 
pre punch that to try to speed up the
process<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.719> I'm<00:02:06.719> gonna<00:02:06.930> put

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
process here a little bit I'm gonna put

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.160 
process here a little bit I'm gonna put
my<00:02:07.500> snail<00:02:09.530> put<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> side

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
my snail put this on the side

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.380 
my snail put this on the side
voila<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.360> part<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.290> done<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.250> then<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
voila this is part it's done and then I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.470 
voila this is part it's done and then I
use<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.349> green<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.950> put<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.640> ribbon<00:02:22.299> on

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
use the green just put like a ribbon on

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.140 
use the green just put like a ribbon on
the<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.519> card

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the the card

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.940 
the the card
I<00:02:26.610> better<00:02:27.610> speed<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.209> here<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.379> see

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
I better speed up here because I can see

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.119 
I better speed up here because I can see
the<00:02:30.250> times<00:02:30.610> when<00:02:30.940> you're<00:02:31.090> flying<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:32.129> don't

know if it's Center on that no time to

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.390 
know if it's Center on that no time to
measure<00:02:37.780> today<00:02:38.140> huh

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400
