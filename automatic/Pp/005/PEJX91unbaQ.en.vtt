00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
them for a week or so you kind of like
it<00:01:54.810> cuz<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.140> they're<00:01:55.439> good<00:01:55.619> fed<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.460> what

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it cuz I know they're good fed so what

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.610 
it cuz I know they're good fed so what
I'll<00:01:56.759> do<00:01:56.939> is

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
I'll do is

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.980 
I'll do is
to<00:01:58.770> fill<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> up<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.200> 60<00:02:01.860> cc's<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.510> 2<00:02:03.510> ounces

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to fill this up and 60 cc's is 2 ounces

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.980 
to fill this up and 60 cc's is 2 ounces
so<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.920> put<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.400> there<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:06.720> let's

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
so I just put it in there and now let's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.060 
so I just put it in there and now let's
give<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.740> squirt<00:02:08.570> real<00:02:09.570> easy<00:02:10.070> because

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
give it a squirt real easy because

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.360 
give it a squirt real easy because
that's<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.610> there's<00:02:12.450> two<00:02:12.690> little<00:02:13.040> deals<00:02:14.040> on

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
that's like there's two little deals on

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610 
that's like there's two little deals on
the<00:02:14.550> end<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.120> tube<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.500> it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the end of that tube and if you do it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.650 
the end of that tube and if you do it
too<00:02:16.770> fast<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.520> pressure<00:02:17.820> washer<00:02:18.360> so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
too fast it's like a pressure washer so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.390 
too fast it's like a pressure washer so
you<00:02:19.440> don't<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.740> want<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.100> go<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.370> really

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you don't you want to just go it really

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
you don't you want to just go it really
easy<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> new<00:02:21.540> land<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.230> I'll

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
easy in a new land like this I'll

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.680 
easy in a new land like this I'll
probably<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.740> give<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> 4<00:02:23.250> ounces<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.910> let's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
probably just give it 4 ounces so let's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.260 
probably just give it 4 ounces so let's
give<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.080> couple<00:02:25.290> tube<00:02:25.590> pulls<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.240> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
give it a couple tube pulls and so I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.830 
give it a couple tube pulls and so I
squirt<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.050> there<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.820> then<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.910> actually<00:02:30.150> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
squirt it in there and then I actually I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.900 
squirt it in there and then I actually I
pull<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.800> out<00:02:31.890> pretty<00:02:32.100> quick<00:02:32.430> because<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.730> don't

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
pull it out pretty quick because I don't

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.470 
pull it out pretty quick because I don't
want<00:02:33.060> any<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.650> liquid<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.830> come<00:02:35.100> out<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.550> get

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
want any that liquid to come out and get

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.930 
want any that liquid to come out and get
into<00:02:36.810> lungs<00:02:37.020> or<00:02:37.260> anywhere<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.370> here's<00:02:38.730> what<00:02:38.880> I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
