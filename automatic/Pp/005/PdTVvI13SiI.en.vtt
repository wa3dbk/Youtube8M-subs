00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
when I think about saying am i doing a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
when I think about saying am i doing a
fact<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.930> nothing<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
fact that this is nothing this is just

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.469 
fact that this is nothing this is just
the<00:01:25.950> beginning<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> work<00:01:27.119> actually

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the beginning of all the work actually

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.749 
the beginning of all the work actually
have<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.619> they're<00:01:28.920> both<00:01:29.130> equally

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
have to do so they're both equally

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
have to do so they're both equally
weighted<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.299> way<00:01:30.540> some<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.229> would<00:01:31.590> like

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
weighted some way some people would like

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
weighted some way some people would like
to<00:01:31.829> differentiate<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> two<00:01:32.939> late<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
to differentiate the two late that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
to differentiate the two late that
dichotomy<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.920> real<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.460> isn't

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
dichotomy of this is real and that isn't

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880 
dichotomy of this is real and that isn't
but<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.600> long<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.049> my<00:01:37.200> reality<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
but for as long as it's my reality and I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.609 
but for as long as it's my reality and I
believe<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.659> then<00:01:39.659> Israel<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.470> me

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
believe and I know then Israel to me

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.280 
believe and I know then Israel to me
that's<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.220> they're<00:01:41.430> both<00:01:41.610> equally<00:01:42.290> get

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that's it so they're both equally get

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.580 
that's it so they're both equally get
worried<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.060> such<00:01:45.320> factories<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.470> your
