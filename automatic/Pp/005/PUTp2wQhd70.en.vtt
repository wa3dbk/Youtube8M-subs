00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.360
 in 20 seconds it can be 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.010
 protagonists for me are people from 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.840
 hollywood hollywood movies 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.500
 so I do not know what they want to be 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.910
 protagonists but it is true yes without 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.050
 microorganisms of more than anything 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.699
 bacteria people will die to all 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:49.059
 all in a very short time can be 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.129
 weeks are months but during all the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.710
 history of life there were no people 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.230
 then very recent people had not 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.479
 mammals there were no fish there was 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.120
 vertebrates that means there was 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.510
 life six billion years before 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.240
 any animal that is very that we 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.460
 we knew very well in this regard are 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.200
 protagonists in a sense that all the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.159
 environment the environment of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.710
 point of view of soil air from 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.920
 food production 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.040
 that is a property of bacteria and not 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.390
 of people people are never productive the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:33.990
 truly productive life on earth 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 is life microbial microbial microbe 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.700
 symbiogenesis is can be said of all 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.580
 he sent them agents come from before a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.820
 Symbiosis Symbiogenesis is the change of 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.390
 for example the appearance of new 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.930
 new species and new fabrics 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.410
 organelles new organs anything 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 new that can be attributed to the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.910
 existence of the symbiosis here are 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.790
 termites we think he reported that those 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.530
 insect animals that eat wood in the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.480
 true but the truth if they can in English 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.060
 ingest wood but can not digest 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.970
 nothing because they have a very community 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.600
 complex community like weaving in its 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.460
 intestine that do all the digestion 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.090
 then that can be said that the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.730
 insect 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.700
 and it has evolved through steam 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.500
 biogenesis the cow has come unemployment 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.800
 genesis is obvious without its microorganisms 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.720
 without fermentation they can not eat you 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.080
 you can eat mine no none 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.060
 no mammal can eat them without 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.280
 symbiont communities that are 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.080
 within what you can say that the low 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.080
 it is a product of serious genesis 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.120
 of 10 seconds not yes good thing 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.330
 important to know that life is not a 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.750
 name is not is not something fixed life is 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.570
 a process is a verb always changes and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.210
 changes through sea flows of 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.420
 energy and matter and there is no video 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.180
 that you can live that can be alive 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.120
 without having this energy flow through 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.970
 light example or organic chemical energy 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.460
 burn granda and can survive I know 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.200
 impossible then people who seek 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.560
 to the origin of life in this 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.290
 transformation of energy and matter to me 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.390
 I think they have much more reason 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.360
 example that those who want to do the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.210
 mix of pastel amino acids vitamins 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.180
 and make a mixture that will come out a 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.010
 dog I do not know with a cell that's not 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.580
 correct in the point of view is 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.130
 philosophically to me it seems to me then 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.930
 sometimes we have not told ourselves that life 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.000
 it is matter but matter that can 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.240
 choose 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.240
 it is matter that chooses and it seems to me that 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.580
 there is some progress on this idea of 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.090
 where has it come from but it seems to me that everything 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.730
 the world we agree that 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.890
 has begun as bacterial life the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.260
 you have too small to have less than 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.359
 a micro but cellular 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.359
 I always ask cell phone
