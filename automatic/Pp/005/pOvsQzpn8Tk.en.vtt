00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
came out and pro 11 was pretty smart

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.570 
came out and pro 11 was pretty smart
because<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.650> actually<00:00:28.980> designed<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> one

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
because they actually designed the one

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
because they actually designed the one
shell<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.910> try<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.330> fit<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.720> many<00:00:31.050> trucks<00:00:31.529> as

blitz the slash the Losi XXX SCT and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.330 
blitz the slash the Losi XXX SCT and
then<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> course<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.989> SCT<00:00:52.440> II<00:00:52.620> which<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> see

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
then of course the SCT II which you see

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130 
then of course the SCT II which you see
it<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:54.000> here

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it right here

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.819 
it right here
now<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.789> being<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:58.050> size<00:00:58.350> fits<00:00:58.710> all

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
now with being a one size fits all

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
now with being a one size fits all
there's<00:00:59.579> always<00:00:59.640> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.750> bit

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
there's always going to be a little bit

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.060 
there's always going to be a little bit
of<00:01:01.129> manipulation<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.399> things<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.030> fit<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
of manipulation to get things to fit and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
of manipulation to get things to fit and
you<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.369> give<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.970> pretty<00:01:06.270> cool

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you know they give this this pretty cool

you know they give this this pretty cool
little<00:01:07.610> thing<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.000> actually<00:01:09.119> built

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
little thing here that's actually built

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
little thing here that's actually built
into<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> shell<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> worry

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
into this shell so you have to worry

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.200 
into this shell so you have to worry
about<00:01:10.920> looking<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.520> instructions<00:01:12.060> or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
about looking for instructions or

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
about looking for instructions or
anything<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.869> gonna<00:01:13.049> try<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.439> my<00:01:13.650> camera

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
anything I'm gonna try and get my camera

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.550 
anything I'm gonna try and get my camera
to<00:01:14.100> focus<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.760> although<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.750> clear

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to focus on this although it is a clear

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100 
to focus on this although it is a clear
plastic<00:01:16.860> deal<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> has<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
plastic deal but it has you know kind of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.749 
plastic deal but it has you know kind of
the<00:01:19.229> whole<00:01:19.409> pattern<00:01:19.650> where<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> drill<00:01:20.460> all

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the whole pattern where to drill all

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
the whole pattern where to drill all
that<00:01:20.939> good<00:01:21.119> stuff<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.689> lists<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that good stuff and it lists all the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.760 
that good stuff and it lists all the
different<00:01:22.380> vehicles<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> fits<00:01:23.670> well

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
different vehicles that it fits well

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.550 
different vehicles that it fits well
never<00:01:25.770> trust<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.540> way<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> basically<00:01:28.290> do

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
never trust that the way I basically do

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.210 
never trust that the way I basically do
my<00:01:28.740> shells<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.460> prior<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.090> painting<00:01:31.009> keep<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
my shells is prior to painting keep that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
my shells is prior to painting keep that
in<00:01:32.369> mind<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.759> cannot<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:34.350> you've

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
in mind you cannot do this if you've

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
in mind you cannot do this if you've
already<00:01:34.650> painted<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.130> shell<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.450> ahead

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
already painted your shell but go ahead

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
already painted your shell but go ahead
and<00:01:36.630> drop<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.990> clear<00:01:37.560> shell<00:01:38.060> after<00:01:39.060> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and drop that clear shell after it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.080 
and drop that clear shell after it's
been<00:01:39.479> trimmed<00:01:40.040> onto<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.340> body<00:01:41.520> posts<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
been trimmed onto the body posts and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.179 
been trimmed onto the body posts and
kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.450> where<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:42.689> lay<00:01:43.009> make<00:01:44.009> sure

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
kind of see where they lay make sure

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.149 
kind of see where they lay make sure
you're<00:01:44.399> centering<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.299> wheels<00:01:46.009> do<00:01:47.009> all

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
you're centering up your wheels do all

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.440 
you're centering up your wheels do all
that<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.549> stuff<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that kind of stuff and what I do is I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.980 
that kind of stuff and what I do is I
take<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.720> black<00:01:49.079> sharpie<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.579> top<00:01:50.990> where

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
take a black sharpie on the top where

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
take a black sharpie on the top where
the<00:01:52.020> protective<00:01:52.829> coating<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:54.000> of

the protective coating is and kind of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.380 
the protective coating is and kind of
dot<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:55.530> body<00:01:55.740> posts<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.240> way

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
dot where my body posts are so that way

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.109 
dot where my body posts are so that way
once<00:01:57.689> I'm<00:01:57.869> done<00:01:58.079> painting<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.369> inside<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.030> the

once I'm done painting the inside of the
shell<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:01.320> outside<00:02:01.799> still<00:02:02.040> has<00:02:02.189> those<00:02:02.369> little

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
shell the outside still has those little

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
shell the outside still has those little
black<00:02:02.790> dots<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.630> planning<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
black dots so now if you're planning a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.660 
black dots so now if you're planning a
black<00:02:04.320> shell<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:05.159> luck

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
black shell good luck

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.370 
black shell good luck
may<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> use<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> different<00:02:06.719> color<00:02:06.960> marker

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
may have to use a different color marker

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.020 
may have to use a different color marker
but<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.310> far<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:10.610> mounting<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.819> holes

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
but as far as the mounting up the holes

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
but as far as the mounting up the holes
the<00:02:12.780> next<00:02:13.050> thing<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.260> need<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.440> do

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the next thing you need to do

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.309 
the next thing you need to do
is<00:02:14.150> go<00:02:15.150> ahead<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.300> paint<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.569> your<00:02:15.720> show<00:02:15.900> and

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
is go ahead and paint up your show and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.089 
is go ahead and paint up your show and
then<00:02:16.910> test<00:02:17.910> fit<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.180> again<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:19.050> it's<00:02:19.890> gonna<00:02:20.010> be

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
then test fit it again now it's gonna be

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.000 
then test fit it again now it's gonna be
a<00:02:20.220> little<00:02:20.340> bit<00:02:20.489> difficult<00:02:20.640> because<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.650> black

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
a little bit difficult because the black

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.010 
a little bit difficult because the black
mark<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.489> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> outside<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.750> have<00:02:24.930> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
mark is on the outside so you have to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.570 
mark is on the outside so you have to
kind<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.230> look<00:02:25.470> through<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.459> know

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
kind of look through and you know

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.190 
kind of look through and you know
typically<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.209> shelves<00:02:27.540> are<00:02:27.660> somewhat

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
typically the shelves are somewhat

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
typically the shelves are somewhat
transparent<00:02:28.709> even<00:02:29.340> when<00:02:29.700> there's<00:02:29.880> paint<00:02:30.209> on

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
transparent even when there's paint on

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.750 
transparent even when there's paint on
them<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.160> see<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.430> little

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
them so you can still see that little

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
them so you can still see that little
black<00:02:32.910> mark<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> lines<00:02:34.020> up<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.500> then

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
black mark see if it lines up and then

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610 
black mark see if it lines up and then
start<00:02:35.430> drilling<00:02:35.840> body<00:02:36.840> reamer<00:02:37.230> works<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
start drilling body reamer works the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.870 
start drilling body reamer works the
best<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:38.130> way<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.400> keeps<00:02:38.580> everything

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
best that way it keeps everything

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.479 
best that way it keeps everything
centered<00:02:39.450> all<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.170> cuts<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:41.130> nice<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
centered all of the cuts are nice and

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.990 
centered all of the cuts are nice and
crisp<00:02:42.019> now<00:02:43.019> as<00:02:43.709> far<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.190> all<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> cutouts<00:02:44.700> on

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
crisp now as far as all the cutouts on

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.949 
crisp now as far as all the cutouts on
this<00:02:45.120> thing<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.450> I'm<00:02:45.510> gonna<00:02:45.599> go<00:02:45.750> ahead<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
this thing and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.390 
this thing and I'm gonna go ahead and
remove<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.350> thing<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.769> guys<00:02:46.980> can<00:02:47.160> see

remove this thing so you guys can see
all<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.330> cutouts<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.810> I've<00:02:49.110> done<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:49.560> far

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
all the cutouts that I've done so far

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.400 
all the cutouts that I've done so far
now<00:02:50.430> keep<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.150> mind<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.630> have<00:02:51.780> not<00:02:51.959> tested<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
now keep in mind I have not tested this

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.280 
now keep in mind I have not tested this
truck<00:02:52.769> at<00:02:52.950> all<00:02:53.010> yet<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.150> kind<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.780> did<00:02:54.989> just

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
truck at all yet so I kind of did just

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.100 
truck at all yet so I kind of did just
the<00:02:55.470> basic<00:02:56.100> ones<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.610> may<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.510> more<00:02:57.810> at<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the basic ones I may be more at the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.309 
the basic ones I may be more at the
track<00:02:58.350> depending<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.400> need<00:02:59.580> any<00:02:59.850> more

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
track depending on if I need any more

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.740 
track depending on if I need any more
airflow<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:02.160> let's<00:03:02.730> take<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> look<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.510> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
airflow so let's take a look here and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.110 
airflow so let's take a look here and
I'll<00:03:03.930> show<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> ones<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.739> cut<00:03:05.069> out

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
I'll show you the ones that I cut out

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.670 
I'll show you the ones that I cut out
initially<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.780> get<00:03:06.900> me<00:03:07.080> started

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
initially to get me started

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.400 
initially to get me started
so<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.430> far<00:03:08.670> as<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> back<00:03:09.060> ones<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.230> kind

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
so as far as the back ones you can kind

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.770 
so as far as the back ones you can kind
of<00:03:10.440> see<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:10.890> I've<00:03:11.069> cut<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:12.150> three<00:03:12.690> of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
of see there I've cut out all three of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.840 
of see there I've cut out all three of
the<00:03:12.840> back<00:03:12.989> ones<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> did<00:03:14.549> was<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the back ones and all I did was I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.640 
the back ones and all I did was I
started<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.420> body<00:03:15.660> reamer<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.290> each

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
started with the body reamer on each

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.509 
started with the body reamer on each
corner<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.799> scored<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.980> with<00:03:20.250> a

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
corner and then kind of scored it with a

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.120 
corner and then kind of scored it with a
straight<00:03:21.450> edged<00:03:21.600> knife<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.140> then<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.010> just

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
straight edged knife and then it just

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.920 
straight edged knife and then it just
pops<00:03:23.340> right<00:03:23.489> out<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:24.299> works<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.630> pretty<00:03:24.780> good

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
pops right out it works out pretty good

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.440 
pops right out it works out pretty good
for<00:03:25.230> me<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:25.350> um<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.519> other<00:03:26.609> one<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.820> did<00:03:27.060> was<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
for me so um the other one I did was the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.210 
for me so um the other one I did was the
hood<00:03:27.690> one<00:03:27.900> hopefully<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.590> guys<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.890> see<00:03:29.040> that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
hood one hopefully you guys and see that

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.460 
hood one hopefully you guys and see that
little<00:03:29.609> hood<00:03:29.910> scoop<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.510> that's<00:03:31.079> all<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> did

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
little hood scoop and that's all I did

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.500 
little hood scoop and that's all I did
so<00:03:31.650> far<00:03:31.859> there's<00:03:32.370> still<00:03:32.640> many<00:03:33.000> more<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.420> you

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
so far there's still many more that you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.319 
so far there's still many more that you
can<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:33.840> there's<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.320> two<00:03:34.850> scoops<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:36.030> here<00:03:36.239> at

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
can do there's the two scoops of here at

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.470 
can do there's the two scoops of here at
the<00:03:36.359> very<00:03:36.510> top<00:03:36.630> there's<00:03:37.620> these<00:03:37.769> little<00:03:38.480> deals

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the very top there's these little deals

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.729 
the very top there's these little deals
right<00:03:39.630> there<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.140> obviously<00:03:40.560> cut

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
right there that you can obviously cut
