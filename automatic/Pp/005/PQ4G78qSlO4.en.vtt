00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 That's the way it is, people, I'm Rodrigo. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 today presents you with a new picture 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.009
 here the channel on which I will talk about 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.130
 games less known around mr andrÃ© 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.410
 and how it is gameplay existence 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
 nor of analyzes that go like this the subject 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 in each video talking about more than one game 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.320
 which I tested clearly by taking advantage of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.150
 highlight some impressions I had 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.429
 about each one of them 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.450
 well today I'm going to talk about three games 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.200
 here we go 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.750
 the role is the same is the ecco the dolphin 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.969
 I could not tell you the exact gender 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.180
 of this rank of charque evolution 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.160
 but to describe in a very summarized way 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 in it you control the shark and you need 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.809
 survive inside the sea 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 for this you need to profile and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.480
 returns a number of companies as 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.129
 fish turtles crustacean birds and even 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.559
 humans that appear swimming 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.080
 diving and of course there are also 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.299
 dangers such as explosives inside the water 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.260
 fish larger than the living water and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 there are no phases and that is why 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 You need to keep yourself alive through 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 as long as possible as eating because 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 staying a long time without eating means 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.560
 starve 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.439
 as you go collecting pure 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 that same gold and making upgrades in the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.049
 your shark 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 you have the ability to unlock 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.570
 other larger ones that can eat more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.700
 things and swimming in deeper water 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.770
 the gameplay is very simple means 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 you move with accelerometer or 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 with a virtual and biodegradable analogue 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.560
 although it may be somewhat monotonous in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.299
 some moments, especially when 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.200
 Can you stay alive at intervals? 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200
 very large 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.789
 sling evolution that sells a product 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.310
 independent and already leave for a series of 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.859
 platforms that even includes a console 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.289
 and it's for me what we 're talking about 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.600
 of a fighting game a style of others 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.000
 famous as the wwf 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.450
 but it focuses on a niche even caricature 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.459
 and a half look for the graphics and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.330
 gameplay in relation to commands is 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.489
 quite complete 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.769
 you can use your team on the screen or 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.099
 virtual controls that seemed to me more 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.260
 suitable they can grab to punch kick 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.690
 can rise in the corner of the ring until leaving 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.700
 I also have that I am he grabs 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.780
 the chair and sticks to attack the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.599
 adversary 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.120
 returning the judge himself these meetings 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.010
 may occur in view mode but 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.200
 there is also a career mode that I 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.090
 I found it very cool and there is a great loss in this 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.280
 mobile version that there is no 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.540
 multiplayer which is a shame but it's 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.359
 understandable for those who enjoy games 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.910
 fast and dynamic the new year on the floor 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.299
 it is not a choice that has a good pace 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.940
 rhythm but for those who just want to 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.180
 distracting from the well- planned game is a 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.180
 good 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.450
 the zombie and kiros a good start to the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.099
 illegal gambling and that's what we 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.900
 find no dejt xote 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.169
 only from the perspective of a creator of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.180
 elite or a sniper when speaking English 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.400
 the mechanics are very simple you stay 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.310
 stopped in a window a zombie sven his 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.230
 direction you look but one and their daughter 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.690
 and the score given on the basis of a series 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.669
 criteria such as your hit rate of 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.680
 sure shots in headshot sequence 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:35.750
 In this way there are blocks of 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.340
 a free close to life and as 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.130
 You will progress, they will appear 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.389
 new weapons are faster but also 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.040
 we are stronger and smarter of course 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.230
 This is a game that has nothing to do with 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.299
 sensational but still does not stop 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.220
 be an interesting experience and that 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:59.950
 no doubt the hiring was illegal 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.720
 It's bitter, that's it, I hope you 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.570
