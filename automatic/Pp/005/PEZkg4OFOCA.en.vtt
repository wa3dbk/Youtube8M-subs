00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.689
 welcome here at a 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.060
 Cooking shows me what we have 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.040
 because today 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.189
 Today we are baking colorful cookies 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.599
 very good and what do we need for it 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.809
 Of course we need the dough for the first time 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.580
 times 240 packs is 100 grams 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:44.260
 sugar 1 packet hold a pinch of salt 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:50.400
 1 125 grams of butter or margarine one 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.400
 bag ten grams special package cacau 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.489
 Salzer 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:27.369
 Well, well , out here, if they are 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.890
 do not have any grated coconut then take it 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.719
 just here 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.399
 you do not always have a bounty 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.590
 Betrayed and then you share the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.959
 burglars please also and see in 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.369
 In the middle there is coconut and it scratches 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:44.979
 you then just get out they see that can 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.360
 you just use everything here again 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:55.890
 Add 200 grams to the world 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.179
 flour 100 200 would add up to a kilometer 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.099
 then comes a special cacau 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.239
 An alternative to this can be one 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.159
 of course, this santa claus 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:07.810
 Just take a little crumble 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.030
 to add three more to that 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.010
 wobble 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.140
 something we need now a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.010
 little bit until I got them 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.750
 do not know anymore 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.760
 that is probably because we at 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.109
 a lactose are in turn and each 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.900
 when we drink milk monsters 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.660
 big shit comes over yes we agree 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.790
 know yes I would say first 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.919
 line water but there what he did not 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.380
 Tastes thought we tastes 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.739
 water but taste what has yes and 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.739
 everyone out 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.150
 that's why it stands in ours 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.670
 I always frank a grapefruit bottle 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.110
 what a coincidence and the combase that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 Now we fill in a bubble on the whole 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.090
 best was full or half empty 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.980
 and then you put the hair on and on 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.159
 Finally, the grapefruit is added 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.620
 yes and with chrome cookie muffins 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.269
 here, of course, the glaze 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.830
 then we would be here who has 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.280
 now the whole thing has to be rough 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.209
 five minutes on sugar 600 what is the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.799
 plastic melts 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.280
 he did not care that the poisonous 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.280
 dampen 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:28.640
 And she actually gives craft 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:31.069
 good is liquid but that's alright 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.810
 Honestly, I do not know what we do 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.370
 we did wrong 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.219
 right ingredients and so on me 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.049
 think it was just the wrong one 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:42.530
 they can sometimes be wrong yes me 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.689
 believe and yes then I would say 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.280
 Hormann for tasting so the show 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.139

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.930
