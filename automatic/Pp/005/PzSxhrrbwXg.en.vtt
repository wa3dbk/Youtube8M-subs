00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.790
 very good guys welcome in addition to 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.960
 my channel and I bring you something that I think 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.970
 I had never brought that it is a mini game 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.350
 that I like quite a lot and good what 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.600
 I left so you could also 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.980
 when you call running flare and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.439
 now as you will see it is a pretty game 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 interesting good now commerce is a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.279
 game of trying to escape death 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 and it's a free game they 're minigames 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.910
 do not expect a great game either but 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.699
 nothing like entertaining mini games 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.199
 I teach you what this stress is 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.140
 and this one he said is the death that we 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.609
 is chasing during the levels and 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.250
 good as you can see this is the version of 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.130
 computer there are 10 levels but it is 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 quite interesting 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.600
 as you see, we have to take the 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.060
 coins and dodge obstacles and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 try to survive along the level 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.330
 and carefully we jump and just like you can 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.130
 see we have 10 levels and then there is a 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.620
 way that is for me is the best thing about 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.420
 game is better than this these well 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.740
 levels you will see that it is a level to go 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.270
 pulling until you get there and you 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.430
 different obstacles will come and there are 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.270
 different levels of difficulty to the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.220
 I will show you a beige we have finished 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.030
 perfect 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.640
 very well 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.000
 I'll show you the other option 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.100
 what is this 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.900
 that simply go doing and as you see 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.940
 we can also change the suit myself 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.620
 I have one of mario good if you also 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.140
 have prepared not to have rights but they 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.020
 see that it is mario but the normal front is 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.479
 this as it is we want normal when 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.830
 we reached a thousand meters in on easy when 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.810
 we reach a thousand meters it is easy we have 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.690
 normal when we reach a thousand meters 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.580
 we have difficult and already when we get to 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.530
 nightmare that nightmare is very difficult 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.180
 I'm going to start the normal so you can see 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.760
 like bach but I tell you it 's hard 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.320
 the nightmares are very cool and we 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.440
 Perez will show you how the first 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.360
 normal that is quite simple and os 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 I say you'll see here I can still go throw it 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.959
 but is that in the nightmare I am very bad 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.060
 because it is very difficult and we are seeing 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.739
 and well that there are some there are 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.480
 obstacles that directly kill you and 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.760
 you can not do anything projects that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.820
 they just hit you who we put there 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.290
 ok I just cut a leg I say 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.360
 there are some like this that kill you at 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.120
 moment but there are others that the only thing 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.120
 they do is hit you then the problem is 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.739
 that since death is following you and 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.690
 if you crash many times because you die 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.130
 for death because you get caught 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.070
 let's do one more in normal and then 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.510
 the nightmare level was taught and that's it and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.710
 good to remember that this more than anything is 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.180
 this more than for a gameplay was for 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.950
 show you the game in case you want 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.050
 play it so I'll leave the link in the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.330
 description that I do think you need 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.250
 have installed and only but good is a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.030
 Complement that nothing does not take up almost anything 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.360
 and it is not vivid or anything is quite safe 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.709
 very well today I am handicapped by them 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.569
 you have not seen the record that I have to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.480
 get to two thousand and one but I'm here today 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.560
 Manco, let's go with nightmare, it's very, very bad 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.170
 we walk with show with is 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.390
 fairly easy but here you see the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.040
 level that we have besides it is also 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.010
 a lot of luck 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.930
 let's go here yes 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.909
 and this sometimes I take advantage of as a 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.920
 kind of book you do like this and still 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.720
 you get out you do not have to cross those three 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.670
 platforms 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.670
 here as you can see, the thing gets complicated 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.099
 we go there to see here 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.629
 and that's it and we kill ourselves very well 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.180
 Well, you have already seen that the level 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.340
 I would weigh is pretty crappy and one thing 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.109
 more but this must be paid if not pay 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.810
 real money if not but during the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.549
 game you are winning coins and you can 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.170
 download as different missions that 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.880
 are levels has been a little bit dicey if 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.640
 for example let's try this 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.450
 for example more like this 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.459
 and I'm dead because they're so crazy and it's 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.280
 see are shorties here for example 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.800
 now let's go for the wall 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.470
 and I've gone back to kill I try it once 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.290
 more and if it does not work out I'll leave it to 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.000
 see that it does not jump anymore 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.150
 well now what I do think that if not then 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.710
 nothing good then guys, this body 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.210
 and Fred is a game that at first sight 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.610
 It does not seem very good but it has been 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.680
 very addictive and I've played a lot 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.419
 hours to this game I will leave the link in 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.970
 the description remember that you will need 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.080
 the complement of unity 3d and good 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.000
 guys, I hope you liked it 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.800

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.410
 been well share it with our friends 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.830
