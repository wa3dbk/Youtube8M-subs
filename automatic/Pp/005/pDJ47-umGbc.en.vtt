00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.790
 threeek runners start with the three and a half minute lead on it 

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:08.319
 peloton at the cross mountain we are then at a little less than 90 kilometers from the line 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.159
 they are visiting the Frenchman country with in our footsteps our fellow countryman Sander Armee 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.480
 and the brit 4 previous leaders have already been taken off course because they are the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.359
 red lights at a pole, however, referred to you 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.720
 when at stake it has been subdued under price, it starts gradually 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.779
 to organise 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.009
 to hunt for the leaders 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.600
 the two of them are still on the wooden kwaremont 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.040
 penn has had to let go, but late in joep and therefore a bad prosperity 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.160
 leading up to the kwaremont she increases nervousness in the peloton with 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.430
 a fall as a result stijn devolder is one of the victims the families 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.990
 to grope 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 camp sets the time 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.120
 difficult to meet that but to bite through a heavy second to it 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.880
 platoon 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.820
 in it pasture on the kwaremont takes the lead but it is another riders who 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 just like yesterday 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160
 very fresh 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.320
 that's something very bad 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.280
 jetset ireland is about suits with a slightly lighter resignment of what is almost occurring 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 and that also Tom Boonen noted he is not going to play flat so free 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.710
 to give 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.330
 along with two other beats, this year has a small gap on the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.370
 rest of the pack 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.470
 but they will soon be there again 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.350
 had a group of seven behind Armenia and something to do with them too 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.750
 two Belgians Maxime Vantomme and Jurgen Roelandts the seven councils in the front runners 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 and so we are at the front with 9 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 with only 34 kilometers to go, their turn can be given by the peloton 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.960
 in the last ten kilometers there are still some escape attempts on this one 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.009
 of competitions concert the least fell 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.009
 but a man was saved outside 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.310
 Toivonen even ran out to the rest at the end what is that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 quieter than I thought I'd fled 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.930
 that is, attracting the sprint for the international of wales that they have 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.260
 said Wednesday 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.910
 the punishment is that but not punishment enough because even this attempt will if you have one 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.780
 success 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.980
 were able to attend on the spot 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.539
 so they were against the beer quay 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.239
 health insurer 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.239
 and so it suddenly comes to the expected mass sprint 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.489
 take it or leave it 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.499
 bernanke 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.739
 furthermore, one more time I can still say about the content 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.289
 can still be released on Friday 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.419
 he is going to act 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.230
 free 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.809
 No 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.809
 costa 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.689
 plus the press that one takes the beat in the last meters 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.959
 hutarovich pineiro is third 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.119
 press officer 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.559
 the fight lasted for the outage after the last honor was proven 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.529
 recently a whole year was ahead and the hand 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.529
 most of the time during peak hours 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.489
 and the boruses the smelly wounds last terneuzen studio also for people 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.959
 that every moment 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:53.880
 and there 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.839
 if I can train again but myself 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:01.449
 and on the site were certainly up to now and for years there was a great player
