it<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> second<00:01:46.289> there<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
it a second there and then we can you

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.320 
it a second there and then we can you
know<00:01:49.770> move<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> around<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.030> linear

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
know move it around it is on the linear

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.540 
know move it around it is on the linear
right<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.660> so<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.319> can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.800> dropped

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
right now so as you can see I dropped

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.400 
right now so as you can see I dropped
down<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.239> to<00:01:54.300> show<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.289> let's

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
down it's going to show there so let's
