00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.030 
somewhere a good way to find it if you
see<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.650> don't<00:02:24.920> know

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
see it on here and you don't know

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.550 
see it on here and you don't know
exactly<00:02:25.550> where<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:25.880> well<00:02:26.300> down<00:02:26.450> shift<00:02:26.930> alt

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
exactly where it is well down shift alt

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.250 
exactly where it is well down shift alt
and<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.310> hover<00:02:28.550> over<00:02:28.940> there's<00:02:29.720> something<00:02:30.050> in

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
and then hover over there's something in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.890 
and then hover over there's something in
you<00:02:30.680> O<00:02:30.709> gradient<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.850> was<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.090> alt<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:32.750> now

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
you O gradient it was just alt but now

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.170 
you O gradient it was just alt but now
they<00:02:33.050> change<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.470> shift<00:02:33.739> alt<00:02:33.950> because<00:02:34.250> Alps

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
they change the shift alt because Alps

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.220 
they change the shift alt because Alps
know<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:38.120> course<00:02:38.300> kind<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.930> always<00:02:39.050> been

now I'm not exactly sure what the

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.960 
now I'm not exactly sure what the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
textures are for the telephone poles I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.300 
textures are for the telephone poles I
am<00:03:38.930> haven't<00:03:39.380> really<00:03:39.590> used<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:39.829> program<00:03:40.190> not

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
am haven't really used this program not

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.630 
am haven't really used this program not
much<00:03:40.519> just<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:42.040> call<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.130> duty<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.489> will

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
much just a call of duty you will

anyways<00:03:44.120> um<00:03:44.500> we're<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.709> make<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.160> into

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
anyways um we're going to make this into

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.810 
anyways um we're going to make this into
a<00:03:46.549> cylinder<00:03:47.440> not<00:03:48.440> using<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.430> physics

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
a cylinder not using the physics

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.220 
a cylinder not using the physics
cylinder<00:03:50.209> cuz<00:03:50.450> that's<00:03:51.190> bad<00:03:52.900> I'm<00:03:53.900> you're<00:03:54.109> going

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
to want to go into patch primitives I

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.500 
to want to go into patch primitives I
hope<00:03:58.459> they<00:03:58.579> didn't<00:03:58.760> say<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:59.000> wrong<00:03:59.180> pet

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
hope they didn't say that wrong pet

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.850 
okay now as you see telephone poles
they're<00:05:36.910> usually<00:05:38.020> mostly<00:05:39.020> connected<00:05:39.650> by

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
they're usually mostly connected by

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.280 
they're usually mostly connected by
something<00:05:40.100> and<00:05:40.400> they're<00:05:41.360> usually<00:05:41.510> rotating

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
something and they're usually rotating

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.130 
something and they're usually rotating
against<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:43.060> road<00:05:44.060> so<00:05:44.450> we<00:05:44.480> don't<00:05:44.840> really<00:05:44.900> have

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
against the road so we don't really have

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.420 
against the road so we don't really have
a<00:05:45.170> route<00:05:46.330> also<00:05:47.330> on<00:05:47.540> don't<00:05:47.990> rotate<00:05:48.200> these<00:05:48.650> these

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
a route also on don't rotate these these

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:57.130 
a route also on don't rotate these these
little<00:05:49.730> tips<00:05:55.450> it's<00:05:56.450> just<00:05:56.600> not<00:05:56.660> really<00:05:56.960> a<00:05:56.990> smart

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
little tips it's just not really a smart

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
now we all know it's not what a cell

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.100 
now we all know it's not what a cell
phone<00:07:01.750> pole<00:07:01.930> looks<00:07:02.200> like<00:07:03.870> that<00:07:04.870> doesn't

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110

phone pole looks like that doesn't
really<00:07:05.320> curve<00:07:05.770> outwards<00:07:06.190> it's<00:07:06.400> come<00:07:06.730> straight

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
really curve outwards it's come straight

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.719 
really curve outwards it's come straight
and<00:07:10.000> it<00:07:10.840> bends<00:07:11.110> down<00:07:14.160> all<00:07:15.160> right

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
and it bends down all right

and it bends down all right
copy<00:07:17.419> it<00:07:17.659> again<00:07:17.960> it's<00:07:18.680> baseball<00:07:20.319> take<00:07:21.319> control

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
copy it again it's baseball take control

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.059 
copy it again it's baseball take control
I<00:07:22.039> to<00:07:22.550> invert<00:07:22.819> it<00:07:22.879> and<00:07:24.430> select<00:07:25.430> all<00:07:25.669> phases<00:07:26.330> and

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:27.069 
I to invert it and select all phases and

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:36.209 
I to invert it and select all phases and
now<00:07:28.069> we<00:07:28.400> just<00:07:28.610> copy<00:07:28.909> it<00:07:29.029> for<00:07:30.219> all<00:07:31.219> these<00:07:31.370> sides
