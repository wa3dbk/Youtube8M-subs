one pole of bipolar disorders depression
and<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:07.880> know<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.060> serotonin<00:01:08.570> has<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> good

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
and we know that serotonin has a good

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.359 
and we know that serotonin has a good
bit<00:01:09.829> to<00:01:09.859> do<00:01:10.219> with<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.090> brain<00:01:11.329> mechanisms<00:01:12.079> of

also been implicated in bipolar disorder

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.520 
also been implicated in bipolar disorder
and<00:01:19.070> then<00:01:19.759> recently<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:20.810> been<00:01:20.899> more

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
and then recently there's been more

and then recently there's been more
interesting<00:01:22.189> glutamate<00:01:22.729> which<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.229> major

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
interesting glutamate which is the major

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.770 
interesting glutamate which is the major

excited excitatory neurotransmitter the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.300 
excited excitatory neurotransmitter the
one<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.170> makes<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.299> neurons<00:01:32.299> fire<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.439> for

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
one that makes the neurons fire and for

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.639 
one that makes the neurons fire and for
example<00:01:34.759> there's<00:01:34.969> some<00:01:35.179> preliminary<00:01:35.929> data

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
example there's some preliminary data

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.590 
example there's some preliminary data
using<00:01:37.340> really<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.819> all<00:01:38.060> which<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.569> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
using really is all which is a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.529 
using really is all which is a
medication<00:01:39.229> which<00:01:39.740> damps<00:01:40.340> down<00:01:40.670> glutamate

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
medication which damps down glutamate

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.319 
medication which damps down glutamate
using<00:01:42.499> that<00:01:42.679> to<00:01:43.009> try<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.340> treat<00:01:43.789> bipolar

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
using that to try to treat bipolar

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.160 
using that to try to treat bipolar
disorder<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:46.399> chances<00:01:47.359> are<00:01:47.539> that<00:01:47.600> there<00:01:48.020> are<00:01:48.109> a

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
disorder so chances are that there are a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.190 
disorder so chances are that there are a
number<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:49.539> neurotransmitter<00:01:50.539> systems<00:01:51.049> that

number of neurotransmitter systems that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
are involved in bipolar disorder it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.510 
are involved in bipolar disorder it
probably<00:01:54.049> ultimately<00:01:54.200> may<00:01:54.799> be<00:01:54.859> hard<00:01:55.219> to<00:01:55.369> find

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
probably ultimately may be hard to find

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.969 
probably ultimately may be hard to find
one<00:01:55.759> that's<00:01:55.999> not<00:01:56.270> we<00:01:57.109> would<00:01:57.319> say<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.799> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
one that's not we would say and the

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.919 
one that's not we would say and the
issue<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.579> putting<00:01:58.999> all<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.240> pieces<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.810> the
