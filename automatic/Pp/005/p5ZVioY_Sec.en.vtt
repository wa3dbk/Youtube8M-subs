can see what's compatible with now the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.030 
can see what's compatible with now the
case<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:39.989> very<00:00:40.320> similar<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:40.920> was

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
case is very similar to what was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.010 
case is very similar to what was
released<00:00:41.370> earlier<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> Lumia<00:00:42.239> 1520

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
which is a nice little folding case and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.200 
which is a nice little folding case and
you<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> hard<00:00:46.020> plastic<00:00:46.260> here

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
you see it's a hard plastic here

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.029

opening here for the camera and then
these<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.039> course<00:00:53.309> latch<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> corners

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
these of course latch on to the corners

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.049 
these of course latch on to the corners
let<00:00:55.020> me<00:00:55.110> show<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> works<00:00:56.070> pretty<00:00:56.550> easy

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
let me show you how it works pretty easy

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.180 
let me show you how it works pretty easy
obviously<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.930> clicks<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:59.039> pretty

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
obviously just clicks in it's pretty

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.119 
obviously just clicks in it's pretty
easy<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.030> well<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.469> what

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
easy to get out as well and that is what

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
easy to get out as well and that is what
the<00:01:02.250> case<00:01:02.399> looks<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.910> overall<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.439> nice

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the case looks like overall really nice

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
the case looks like overall really nice
design<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> gives<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> lot<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
design you know gives you a lot of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
design you know gives you a lot of
protection<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> device<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.640> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
protection on the device you can kind of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
protection on the device you can kind of
see<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> there<00:01:09.060> doesn't<00:01:10.020> add<00:01:10.170> much<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> way

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
see it there doesn't add much in the way

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
see it there doesn't add much in the way
a<00:01:10.979> thickness<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.820> does<00:01:12.030> offer<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
a thickness but does offer a lot of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
a thickness but does offer a lot of
support<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.560> case<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.280> drop<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
support in case you know you drop it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.460 
support in case you know you drop it
accidentally<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.290> nice

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
accidentally and you get that nice

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
accidentally and you get that nice
corner<00:01:16.979> protection<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
corner protection because all of this is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800 
corner protection because all of this is
metal<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.220> easy<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> dent<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
metal it's very easy to dent and if you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
metal it's very easy to dent and if you
were<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> drop<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> ground<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.040> would

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
were to drop on the ground it would

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
were to drop on the ground it would
definitely<00:01:23.310> either<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:24.780> least<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
definitely either the very least it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
definitely either the very least it
would<00:01:25.320> scoff<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> could<00:01:26.220> easily<00:01:26.340> dents<00:01:26.790> so

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
would scoff but it could easily dents so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
would scoff but it could easily dents so
you<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> corner<00:01:28.290> protection<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.310> go

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you want that corner protection now go

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.890 
you want that corner protection now go
over<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
over to the back here you can see the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.719 
over to the back here you can see the
camera<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.350> stuff<00:01:31.560> may<00:01:31.710> unique<00:01:32.100> design<00:01:32.460> they

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
camera at stuff may unique design they

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
camera at stuff may unique design they
obviously<00:01:32.970> made<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.540> pretty<00:01:34.170> large<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
obviously made this pretty large to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
obviously made this pretty large to
allow<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.189> flash<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> could

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
allow the flash in there and it could

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.609 
allow the flash in there and it could
have<00:01:36.360> done<00:01:36.450> different<00:01:36.810> design<00:01:37.079> choices<00:01:37.350> but

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
have done different design choices but

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.710 
have done different design choices but
they<00:01:37.710> went<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> full<00:01:38.369> circle<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they went with that full circle and it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.450 
they went with that full circle and it
does<00:01:40.079> give<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> distinctive<00:01:40.979> look<00:01:41.220> that's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
does give it a distinctive look that's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.840 
does give it a distinctive look that's
for<00:01:41.640> sure<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> quick<00:01:44.250> tour<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
for sure but that is a quick tour of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
for sure but that is a quick tour of
