00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
very scary concept this gun is probably

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
very scary concept this gun is probably
the<00:00:36.840> most<00:00:37.020> noob<00:00:37.590> friendly<00:00:37.890> weapon<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
game very very similar to I guess all

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.069 
game very very similar to I guess all
the<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:42.090> shotguns<00:00:42.390> even<00:00:42.840> though<00:00:42.930> it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the other shotguns even though it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
the other shotguns even though it's
semi-auto<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.890> span<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.610> if

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
semi-auto you can span this thing as if

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.569 
semi-auto you can span this thing as if
it<00:00:44.820> was<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> UCS<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.750> um<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> also<00:00:47.309> haves

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it was a UCS or um it kind of also haves

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.080 
it was a UCS or um it kind of also haves
that<00:00:47.789> feel<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> Saiga<00:00:48.899> from<00:00:49.260> bf3<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.879> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that feel of the Saiga from bf3 but this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.310 
that feel of the Saiga from bf3 but this
thing<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.360> quite<00:00:51.539> potent<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.079> pretty

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
thing is quite potent is pretty

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
thing is quite potent is pretty
dangerous<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.309> gameplay<00:00:53.520> I've

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
dangerous I think in this gameplay I've

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.430 
dangerous I think in this gameplay I've
got<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> few<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> quit<00:00:54.930> too<00:00:55.110> anything<00:00:55.379> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
got a few things to quit too anything I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.299

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
got the potato grip and the laser sight

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
got the potato grip and the laser sight
and<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.730> attached<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and want not attached to it there are a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
and want not attached to it there are a
few<00:01:01.469> amounts<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.460> attachments<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> cannot

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
few amounts of attachments that cannot

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
few amounts of attachments that cannot
somewhat<00:01:04.140> tweak<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.619> stuff<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.979> guys<00:01:05.100> think

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
somewhat tweak your stuff you guys think

somewhat tweak your stuff you guys think
it<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.119> slight

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it I think you got to take a slight

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960 
it I think you got to take a slight
sacrifice<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.100> rate<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.310> fire<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
sacrifice to your rate of fire if you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.550 
sacrifice to your rate of fire if you
want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.720> bit<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.049> accuracy

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
want to have a little bit more accuracy

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.399 
want to have a little bit more accuracy
I<00:01:10.950> find<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.210> sight<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.170> useful

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
I find a me down sight is quite a useful

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.010 
I find a me down sight is quite a useful
thing<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.310> weapon<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
thing to do with this weapon and at the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
thing to do with this weapon and at the
end<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> day<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> thing<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> pretty

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
end of the day the thing has a pretty

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
end of the day the thing has a pretty
bit<00:01:17.820> pretty<00:01:18.540> good<00:01:18.720> decent<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> range

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
bit pretty good decent bit of range

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.899 
bit pretty good decent bit of range
right<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.040> head<00:01:20.340> I've<00:01:20.490> been<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.729> bit

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
right there head I've been a little bit

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.740 
right there head I've been a little bit
more<00:01:21.060> accurate<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.420> would<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.630> been<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
more accurate that would have been a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.810 
more accurate that would have been a
three<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:22.049> four<00:01:22.200> shot<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> five<00:01:23.430> shot<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
three or four shot not a five shot it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
three or four shot not a five shot it
carries<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.119> six<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.439> one

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
carries about six in there and the one

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
carries about six in there and the one
good<00:01:25.830> drawback<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> weapon<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
good drawback of the weapon is that you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.410 
good drawback of the weapon is that you
have<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> manually<00:01:29.100> reload<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.150> like

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
have to manually reload so it's not like

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.840 
have to manually reload so it's not like
the<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> m26<00:01:31.590> mass<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.579> just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the the m26 mass where you have to just

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
the the m26 mass where you have to just
completely<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> clip<00:01:33.659> back<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.049> there

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
completely put a clip back in there

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
completely put a clip back in there
it's<00:01:34.829> nothing<00:01:35.220> along<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> lines<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it's nothing along the lines of that you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's nothing along the lines of that you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
just a little bit over 30,000 points

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.170 
just a little bit over 30,000 points
total<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> support<00:01:44.399> category<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
total in the support category so you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.569
