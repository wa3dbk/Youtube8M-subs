00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
seasons but I don't believe this was a

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.600 
seasons but I don't believe this was a
result<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.870> lack<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.170> effort<00:01:00.220> well<00:01:01.220> certainly

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610

I've given some thought to this and
tried<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.890> do<00:01:04.129> some<00:01:04.369> planning<00:01:05.119> around<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.570> but

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:05.889 
tried to do some planning around it but

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.289 
tried to do some planning around it but
knowing<00:01:06.889> that<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.159> decision<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.759> very<00:01:07.789> fresh

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299
