Network coming at you again the day
today<00:00:31.430> I<00:00:31.640> wanted<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:32.029> finish<00:00:32.330> a<00:00:32.360> series<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:33.380> I

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
today I wanted to finish a series that I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.380 
today I wanted to finish a series that I
started<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.340> just<00:00:34.400> didn't<00:00:34.820> have<00:00:34.940> enough<00:00:34.970> time

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
started and just didn't have enough time

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.470 
started and just didn't have enough time
to<00:00:35.690> get<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:37.280> series<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.120> foreign

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
to get to and the series is the foreign

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640 
to get to and the series is the foreign
one<00:00:38.840> stark<00:00:39.559> brick<00:00:40.370> it's<00:00:41.239> for<00:00:41.480> ket<00:00:41.690> brickmaker

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
one stark brick it's for ket brickmaker

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.950 
one stark brick it's for ket brickmaker
which<00:00:43.010> may<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:43.250> basically<00:00:43.610> makes<00:00:43.880> these<00:00:44.150> paper

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
which may it basically makes these paper

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.220 
which may it basically makes these paper
bricks<00:00:45.380> just<00:00:45.739> like<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.630> then<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:47.960> call

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
bricks just like this and then you call

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.049 
bricks just like this and then you call
it<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.470> paper<00:00:48.800> log<00:00:49.100> you<00:00:49.610> know<00:00:49.700> there's<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.910> lot<00:00:50.000> of

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
it a paper log you know there's a lot of

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.509 
it a paper log you know there's a lot of
different<00:00:50.360> variances<00:00:50.930> out<00:00:51.110> there<00:00:51.380> I<00:00:52.100> was

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
different variances out there I was

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.130 
different variances out there I was
gonna<00:00:52.640> do<00:00:52.760> something<00:00:53.000> fancy<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:53.930> was<00:00:54.019> going

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
gonna do something fancy and I was going

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.780 
gonna do something fancy and I was going
to<00:00:54.230> cut<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:54.620> know<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.949> same<00:00:55.160> size<00:00:55.430> piece<00:00:55.670> of

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
to cut you know the same size piece of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.910 
to cut you know the same size piece of
wood<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.210> do<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.449> burn<00:00:56.720> test<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:57.440> see<00:00:57.589> how<00:00:57.620> long

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
wood and do a burn test and see how long

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.950 
wood and do a burn test and see how long
it<00:00:58.100> took<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.850> bunch<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.510> different<00:00:59.629> you

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
it took and a bunch of different you

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.079 
it took and a bunch of different you
know<00:01:00.080> testing<00:01:00.589> but<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:01.519> know<00:01:01.640> going<00:01:01.940> through

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
know testing but you know going through

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.450 
know testing but you know going through
the<00:01:02.420> process<00:01:03.080> of<00:01:03.199> making<00:01:03.350> these<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:04.339> know

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
the process of making these you know

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.560 
the process of making these you know
some<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:04.850> different<00:01:05.180> compression

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
some have different compression

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.710 
some have different compression
different<00:01:06.260> density<00:01:06.770> different<00:01:07.520> paper<00:01:07.790> so

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
different density different paper so

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480 
different density different paper so
what<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:08.870> was<00:01:09.020> gonna<00:01:09.110> do<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.590> I<00:01:09.680> got<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:09.860> good<00:01:10.070> bed

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
what I was gonna do is I got a good bed

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.430 
what I was gonna do is I got a good bed
of<00:01:10.610> coals<00:01:10.820> going<00:01:11.120> here<00:01:11.480> in<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.630> wood<00:01:11.810> stove<00:01:12.080> I

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
of coals going here in the wood stove I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.230 
of coals going here in the wood stove I
was<00:01:12.860> gonna<00:01:12.950> throw<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.280> couple<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:13.730> there<00:01:14.000> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
was gonna throw a couple on there and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.450 
was gonna throw a couple on there and
just<00:01:14.300> see<00:01:15.050> how<00:01:15.080> they<00:01:15.290> burn<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.800> let<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:16.280> know

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
just see how they burn and let you know

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.790 
just see how they burn and let you know
and<00:01:16.930> this<00:01:17.930> probably<00:01:18.229> be<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.409> pretty<00:01:18.650> short

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
and this probably be a pretty short

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.520 
and this probably be a pretty short
video<00:01:19.010> but<00:01:19.909> I<00:01:20.240> want<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.720> finish<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:21.140> series

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
video but I want to finish the series

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.220 
video but I want to finish the series
and<00:01:21.920> do<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.400> burn<00:01:22.670> test<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.180> these<00:01:23.330> bricks<00:01:23.600> so

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
and do a burn test on these bricks so

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:51.980 
and do a burn test on these bricks so
here<00:01:24.380> we<00:01:24.500> go

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.999 

okay<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.049> they've<00:01:53.439> been<00:01:53.530> burning<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:53.979> about

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
okay so they've been burning for about

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.639 
okay so they've been burning for about
ten<00:01:54.490> minutes<00:01:54.700> or<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.720> they're<00:01:56.290> actually

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
ten minutes or so and they're actually

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.429 
ten minutes or so and they're actually
still<00:01:57.070> pretty<00:01:57.100> solid<00:01:57.759> in<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.000> center<00:01:58.299> so<00:01:58.600> I'm

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
still pretty solid in the center so I'm

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.830 
still pretty solid in the center so I'm
pretty<00:01:59.770> impressed<00:01:59.950> for<00:02:00.430> how<00:02:00.670> long<00:02:00.939> I<00:02:01.360> thought

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
pretty impressed for how long I thought

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.740 
pretty impressed for how long I thought
they<00:02:02.020> were<00:02:02.079> gonna<00:02:02.200> burn<00:02:02.860> up<00:02:03.070> pretty<00:02:03.280> quick<00:02:03.750> but

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
they were gonna burn up pretty quick but

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.389 
they were gonna burn up pretty quick but
it's<00:02:05.289> not<00:02:05.799> really<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:07.590> standalone<00:02:08.590> fuel<00:02:09.069> source

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it's not really a standalone fuel source

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.850 
it's not really a standalone fuel source
I<00:02:09.759> guess<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.840> could<00:02:11.050> if<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.260> had<00:02:11.380> some<00:02:11.590> sort

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
I guess you could if you had some sort

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.000 
I guess you could if you had some sort
of<00:02:12.390> propane<00:02:13.390> assist<00:02:13.989> but<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:14.440> again<00:02:14.590> it's

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
of propane assist but then again it's

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.120 
of propane assist but then again it's
not<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> standalone<00:02:15.989> feel<00:02:16.989> source<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.620> one<00:02:18.040> of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
not a standalone feel source and one of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.040 
not a standalone feel source and one of
the<00:02:18.190> biggest<00:02:18.489> reasons<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.360> know<00:02:19.720> like<00:02:19.900> any

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the biggest reasons is you know like any

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.590 
the biggest reasons is you know like any
fire<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.709> need<00:02:20.860> cold<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.970> know<00:02:22.060> coals<00:02:22.360> is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
fire you need cold you know coals is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600 
fire you need cold you know coals is
what<00:02:22.780> keeps<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.380> going<00:02:23.830> gives<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> heat

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
what keeps that going gives it the heat

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.250 
what keeps that going gives it the heat
and<00:02:24.819> then<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> oxygen<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.230> course

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
and then you have the oxygen of course

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.520 
and then you have the oxygen of course
field<00:02:26.799> source<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:28.330> these<00:02:28.569> bricks<00:02:29.049> I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
field source so with these bricks I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.199 
field source so with these bricks I
think<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.459> would<00:02:30.549> be<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.670> good<00:02:30.790> supplement

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
think that it would be a good supplement

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.500 
think that it would be a good supplement
to<00:02:32.160> whatever<00:02:33.160> you're<00:02:33.430> doing<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.849> like<00:02:34.239> in<00:02:34.390> my

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
to whatever you're doing like like in my

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.270 
to whatever you're doing like like in my
shop<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.989> use<00:02:35.140> them<00:02:35.290> as<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> supplement<00:02:36.010> or<00:02:36.190> I'm

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
shop I use them as a supplement or I'm

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.009 
shop I use them as a supplement or I'm
going<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:36.940> was<00:02:37.090> actually<00:02:37.269> my<00:02:37.540> first<00:02:37.569> burn

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
going to this was actually my first burn

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.920 
going to this was actually my first burn
test<00:02:38.380> with<00:02:38.620> these<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.610> I'll<00:02:40.209> probably<00:02:40.569> just

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
test with these so I'll probably just

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.620 
test with these so I'll probably just
Adam<00:02:41.739> as<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> supplement<00:02:42.489> they<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.150> take<00:02:43.599> a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
Adam as a supplement they do take a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.900 
Adam as a supplement they do take a
little<00:02:43.870> bit<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.170> time<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.560> dry<00:02:44.799> about<00:02:45.280> 30<00:02:45.700> days

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
little bit of time to dry about 30 days

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.479 
little bit of time to dry about 30 days
roughly<00:02:46.450> 45<00:02:46.930> days<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.410> actually<00:02:47.860> thoroughly

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
roughly 45 days to actually thoroughly

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.069 
roughly 45 days to actually thoroughly
cure<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:50.940> overall<00:02:51.940> seems<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> lot<00:02:53.049> of

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
cure so overall seems like a lot of

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.130 
cure so overall seems like a lot of
effort<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:55.090> know<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.510> an<00:02:55.630> alternative

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
effort for you know just an alternative

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.770 
effort for you know just an alternative
fuel<00:02:56.380> source<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.160> again<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.359> it's<00:02:58.660> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
fuel source but then again it's a it's a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.229 
fuel source but then again it's a it's a
free<00:02:59.019> fuel<00:02:59.320> source<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.430> know<00:03:00.549> get<00:03:00.760> scrap

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
free fuel source so you know get scrap

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.360 
free fuel source so you know get scrap
paper<00:03:01.510> from<00:03:01.810> all<00:03:01.930> over<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.290> place<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.769> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
paper from all over the place and you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.460 
paper from all over the place and you
can<00:03:03.400> make<00:03:03.670> your<00:03:03.820> own<00:03:03.880> bricks<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.569> pretty<00:03:05.350> much

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
can make your own bricks and pretty much

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.470 
can make your own bricks and pretty much
for<00:03:05.709> free<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.100> just<00:03:06.549> your<00:03:06.730> labor<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.209> time

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
for free it's just your labor your time
