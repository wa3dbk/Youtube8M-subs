 and today I bring you the second part of the review of marvel versus k with 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.759
 well this time the video will be more intense than the previous one so I do not know 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.369
 take off from the monitor screen because what is coming is one of the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.989
 best games in history because enough of so many blah blah blah and let's start 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.989
 once 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 young 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.560
 after the success that the country had versus falls against me I knew doubles to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.370
 early 2000 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.479
 He hunted men and to launch one of the best games of all 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 on your plate pts 3 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.960
 in the famous Piazza Navona 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440
 delivery of Tuesday versus cascon 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.000
 the novelties like for example a boy of characters scenarios 3d a system 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.659
 of better games from his predecessor madrid 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.380
 the trend in your hands of your lawyers 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.710
 brings together almost all the characters that have appeared since 2007 do not shoot 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 basket for French cac with playoffs superheroes apart from 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 new characters from both sides looking 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.290
 56 fighters 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.110
 in this new installment it was said that the characters would be in teams of three 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.110
 but still more fights in a row 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 well now we will see another novelty of the game 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.980
 and is that he would be born again 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.980
 the team characters 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.869
 pure up to the bed 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.869
 increase your energy and recover 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.479
 another new thing that this game was that they had confirmed 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.129
 it was ordered 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.359
 to change characters to tie 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.489
 the arcadia chorus 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.919
 and is that three characters and share debt 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.979
 the equipment that people already have 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:41.019
 efe at least has a super combo and the entire team shares only one hand 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.339
 the control scheme 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:46.999
 separate buttons for June 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.009
 'the parapapÃ¡' way 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.009
 to call a character while hitting his opponent 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.839
 the game's novelties that make it more spectacular and faster 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.229
 cancel a special move by another player's before one finishes 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:04.099
 you have a maximum of five bars to make special movements 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.099
 some characters require three to do it 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.190
 well, just like him 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.380
 marvel versus cascon still the game is still unbalanced so there 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.000
 yes they are more famous than in the previous one apart from the news that already 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.099
 I said 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.319
 I will talk about the background music that is handled by the game 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.839
 openuku kukoc with sauce and something carnival if good 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.839
 FillÃ³n made the game itself but the only one of its kind 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.529
 yes to Syria through 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.529

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 after the launch of mark webber their boxes 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.229
 the rights of marvel and that's why there was not a third part of the game 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.929
 but I will speak 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.299
