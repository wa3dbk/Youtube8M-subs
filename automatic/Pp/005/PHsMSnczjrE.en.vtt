00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
one OVA which the OVA is roughly the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.420 
one OVA which the OVA is roughly the
time<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.900> average<00:01:46.200> anime<00:01:46.650> episode<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.250> I

time of an average anime episode so I
was<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.000> bummed<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
was a little bit bummed about that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
was a little bit bummed about that
because<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:48.840> did<00:01:48.990> skip<00:01:49.260> out<00:01:49.410> on<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.590> couple<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
details and it kind of felt a little bit

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.570 
details and it kind of felt a little bit

anything<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.760> most<00:04:59.970> part<00:05:00.240> it's<00:05:00.480> very

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
anything for the most part it's very

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.840 
anything for the most part it's very
simple<00:05:01.139> eradicate<00:05:01.800> these<00:05:01.980> fucking<00:05:02.400> road<00:05:02.610> says

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
simple eradicate these fucking road says

simple eradicate these fucking road says
but<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.150> does<00:05:03.270> have<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.480> little<00:05:03.630> bit<00:05:03.750> depth<00:05:04.020> to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
but it does have a little bit depth to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.540 
but it does have a little bit depth to
it<00:05:04.169> as<00:05:04.320> well<00:05:04.500> because<00:05:04.620> if<00:05:04.919> you<00:05:05.010> look<00:05:05.190> at<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.430> it

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
it as well because if you look at it it

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.340 
it as well because if you look at it it
kind<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.790> goes<00:05:06.000> into<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.419> politics<00:05:06.930> of<00:05:07.110> things

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.500 
kind of goes into the politics of things
and<00:05:07.530> how<00:05:07.890> when<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.640> don't<00:05:08.910> have<00:05:09.090> money<00:05:09.390> you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
and how when you don't have money you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.970 
and how when you don't have money you
don't<00:05:09.840> have<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.050> say<00:05:10.260> so<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.470> lot<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.740> time
