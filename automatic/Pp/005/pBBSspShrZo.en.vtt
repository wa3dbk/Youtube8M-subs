to make it as real as possible was to

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.550 
to make it as real as possible was to
shake<00:01:26.650> everything<00:01:27.400> I<00:01:27.600> told<00:01:28.600> them<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:29.290> make<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
build all of these shaky decks who

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.890 
build all of these shaky decks who
basically<00:01:38.680> have<00:01:39.100> hydraulic<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.270> Aaron

basically have hydraulic and Aaron

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.450 
basically have hydraulic and Aaron
pneumatic<00:01:41.320> system<00:01:41.680> that<00:01:42.130> will<00:01:42.280> basically

pneumatic system that will basically

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.630 
pneumatic system that will basically
shakes<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.120> back<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.420> forth<00:01:44.280> probably<00:01:45.280> done

it<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.210> trucks<00:01:52.510> flames<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.830> we're<00:01:54.010> moving

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
it with trucks flames so we're moving

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.760 
it with trucks flames so we're moving
roughly<00:01:54.880> around<00:01:55.060> 60,000<00:01:56.050> pounds<00:01:56.170> back<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
roughly around 60,000 pounds back and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.020 
roughly around 60,000 pounds back and
forth<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.750> be<00:01:58.870> ready<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.530> still<00:02:00.340> remember<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.370 
first time we shot the big shaky floors
it<00:02:03.760> was<00:02:03.910> quite<00:02:04.330> frightening<00:02:04.720> for<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.200> whole

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380
