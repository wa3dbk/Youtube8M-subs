00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.260
 very good to all the players here 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.270
 we are in a new video and in this 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.400
 I come to bring you the dungeon of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.830
 the yew the cavern because in this case 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.630
 I come with Jada who is a friend of mine who 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 already open and I did an interview 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 recently on my channel and he helped me 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.930
 pass the cavern of the tubes of the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 yew we occupy here which is for level 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.039
 190 more is recommended the fangs 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.760
 of glass and the only thing we would have to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 to do would be to come to minus 61 minus 69 and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 talk to the teacher already to be able to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.540
 enter this dungeon this dungeon 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.969
 for me it is the most boring of not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.550
 complicated but a little annoying of cold 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 since good here we have four rooms and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 the fifth room would be necessary 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.680
 pass these four rooms to be able to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 move on to the fifth below 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
 I will explain how and why we enter the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.649
 first room and I'm going to explain a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.480
 little all the monsters above 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.840
 the test there will be a monster that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 will push and attract online and also if 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.199
 we beat him with a gun when he has a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 certain state will always lose m is everything 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.770
 the world so be careful with this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.199
 Badger was like the WHO was credited as 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.689
 will give sacrifice to his allies 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 and intercept the also the night 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 they are also can be somewhat annoying already 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 that a kind of illusion will be given but it is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 as an illusion exactly the same only 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.689
 that will become invisible by hitting that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 illusion well the return and the truth is 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.509
 that will not do much will be one of the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.220
 simpler monsters that we will have 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.950
 around here since it will be the most typical and the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.170
 easier to kill after we have here 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.110
 to the aunts weaves that are nothing 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 annoying they have land weakness and they are 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.200
 easy to kill and the pyro's are that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.880
 they would be the last enemies that have 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.189
 enough resistance to fire and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 Weakness of water take away from us like 200 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.380
 damage or more so be careful with 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.819
 these destructive bugs and good 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.289
 we have here in the mission minutes 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.329
 we will have got a relic of 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.039
 pearson one management one of badger or more 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.110
 and one of tiles that would be necessary 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.520
 to be able to talk to the process already and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.319
 to be able to give them the relics to be able to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.819
 go through the fifth door so good 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.920
 we have to follow this path that 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.509
 it would be the only way to be able to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.060
 get to the treasure that has no losses 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.500
 It's worth three or four maps and then 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.420
 if we have passed it, we will reach the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.539
 last room room 5 where we have the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.369
 earthy and the teacher already 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.629
 then obviously how is it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.579
 I will explain to you how 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.469
 take away the invulnerability to the test or 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.540
 if the teacher will no longer be in 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:20.000
 vulnerable so we can kill him from 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.439
 normal and practical way as with 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.659
 any other monster what will have 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.489
 a special spell is obviously already 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.319
 that is not a very common monster here 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.450
 I was not carrying a bit to the sacrum 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.890
 and you have to take into account the good 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.260
 first of all, the teacher already 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.150
 will attack online and will remove enough 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.829
 wait as we see here quito 4p the panda 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.780
 and 3p the scammer so be very careful 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.180
 with which we remove both and keep it 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.769
 away and hit him far away so that he does not 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.920
 have the opportunity to leave us are 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.560
 immobilized is highly recommended for not 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.930
 ie compulsory away and shuffleboard 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.280
 since when we hit an ally to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.989
 hit everyone else or for 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.480
 distribute the damage so to 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.150
 then you will see me because here 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.189
 we see the spell you have that attracts and 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.569
 then he pushes you and we should have 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.799
 Beware of not hitting him with a weapon when 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.750
 is in a certain state because if not 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.970
 we will remove 100 p.m. all and yes 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.220
 It can be quite harmful 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.590
 so monitor a little the state of the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.700
 roof so as not to hit him with weapons 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.379
 everything that with that we can always hit him 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.270
 we already see that here we are moving away a 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 little the weight since it can since not 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.150
 we want you to come to us 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.890
 because if it's not going to take away enough and 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.650
 Now you are going to see two things that the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.780
 weight that one would be to heal and here 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.790
 We see that when he hits, he distributed the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 damage as I take 500 to the panda then 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.200
 more or less the entire team lost about 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.180
 400 or 500 such a thing so this 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.790
 would be the disadvantage of the tesoso and always 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.380
 it is advisable to keep it well away 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.299
 here it is necessary to explain that the professor already 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.950
 gives a state every two shifts that when 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.080
 we hit an enemy will heal everyone 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 the allies to our allies who are 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.890
 five squares away as we saw 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.220
 here we cure the scammer enough 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.959
 we were a thousand and one things like that and it would be 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.420
 the only way to heal since as 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.010
 you will see below 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.170
 lan and typsa well I said good to the best 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.150
 I can heal I do not know what I lived and there they went 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.069
 cure them well but then I look at the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.170
 been and we had less than 10,000 cures 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.510
 so do not even think about curing him 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.209
 neither knows nor with any character that 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.829
 You can cure as we see here 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.959
 nocturnal conceived this allusion that 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.639
 makes invisible and only advanced one square 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.440
 so I already knew where I was and I 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.630
 I could hit but it would be 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.050
 that would be exactly an illusion 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.600
 exactly identical the only thing that will be 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.310
 invisible when we read and good as 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.560
 we see here to highlight the teacher is 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.090
 fix the enemies do not relive them with 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.410
 all of life but if it can be something 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.480
 annoyed and you have to be careful with him 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.340
 when we see that here the tea can be 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.470
 cure again and here I invented some 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.880
 plays to be able to move away from that 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.760
 site that was quite close to 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.250
 our characters I decided here to change 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.130
 with the vessel because as you know 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.780
 vessel back online and so power in the 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.700
 the vessel's turn away from a 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.260
 little bit of terror and here I wanted to teach 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.120
 as you take out with the twine that 10 thousand 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.380
 two is pretty good a bit of 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.969
 charged that you already see that I have three 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.639
 12-shift shifts d 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.110
 of equal intelligence and here the professor 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.849
 He was already dying and well I wanted to 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.199
 show you that if the 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.939
 critical toast because I would have 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.429
 killed but the truth is that only one 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.509
 and I did not have the opportunity but good 

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:16.149
 the teacher is no longer in a state 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.039
 invulnerable and girls and I do not know why in 

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.479
 this turn attacked me or nothing the one 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.909
 team that is called equilibri that does not 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.769
 I think it's hers to heal en masse 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.499
 when an ally attacks five squares 

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:28.989
 and all that and here the panda was 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.599
 a little clueless and it was a little 

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:33.699
 slow that would be nothing minimum nor doha and 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.469
 He pushed the yew here and he's going to kill the 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.739
 teacher and then you will see a 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.779
 bus that has to heals like 9000 of 

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:42.339
 life a super weird thing that we're going to 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:46.389
 see here that gives you a hangover and it ends 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:48.129
 dying and he gives eight thousand 838 work me 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.139
 put over 9,000 that lasts the teacher already 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.909
 just when he was dying but well yes 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.889
 you have to be careful with the 500's 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.319
 damage that the yew gives its that I do not know if 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.539
 that endured there but it can be 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.539
 quite bad enough to have those 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.099
 500 damages of such a strong enemy 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.380
 next I will explain how 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.240
 take away the invulnerability and well 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.030
 we will have to have a character that 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.100
 invoke something you see but something that sticks 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.100
 as one we know he has a dragon and 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.570
 when this invocation hits the yew 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.700
 his going to lose he is so vulnerable 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.080
 during the turn or it will be during a shift 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.300
 until the turn returns to the 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.160
 sword that would be in this case who 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.260
 has produced the damage because it could be 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.750
 some to fashions with his dragon with his hope 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.280
 all or any other invocation as 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.890
 a kitten from a furrow I do any 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.450
 little thing and since then we can 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.700
 hit all this your montero up 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.320
 to lower it enough life let's say that 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.690
 here he hit the sword again and again 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.730
 well, show you how we would have here 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.670
 we went down a bit of weaknesses and now 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.890
 we started hitting him again with a hangover 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.330
 of the panda and good already here no longer 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.490
 there was nothing of life he hit a hangover 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.230
 in miami and doha base because he dedicated himself to 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.570
 hesitate a little bit because he said 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.470
 come on, let's do it cool, well, I do not 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.030
 I had realized that I had 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.980
 reconstitution and he wanted to take the 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.780
 tongue it so as not to have to spend 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.700
 so much bread but good with water this one 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.960
 I said let me get reconstituted and nothing 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.470
 in the end it ends up killing and so 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.270
 we can do absolutely nothing 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.950
 or the dungeon you see that it does not have much 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.510
 complication here we finish it and talking 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.100
 with the teacher will be noted two options 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.690
 he told me that if he took the second 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.890
 option was going to kill me and I preferred not to 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.200
 do it but I know I was hesitating 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.820
 I still managed to get out of the dungeon and 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.280
 have already completed the necessary mission 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.050
 to be able to pass this dungeon and good 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.240
 this would be the video and I hope that I have 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.190
 liked if you want to like it 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.020
 it always helps me a lot to subscribe 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.270
 for more videos and good as I say 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.270
