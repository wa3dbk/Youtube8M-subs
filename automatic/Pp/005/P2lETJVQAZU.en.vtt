00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
should I think me more than that because

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.440 
should I think me more than that because

for<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> couple<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.280> times<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.580> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
for a couple of times in the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
each other and he's always been

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.000 
each other and he's always been
impressive<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> decent<00:03:40.830> player

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
impressive I think it's a decent player

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.930 
impressive I think it's a decent player
RAB<00:03:41.340> marez<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.000> rate<00:03:42.510> also<00:03:42.750> he<00:03:43.530> was<00:03:43.710> a<00:03:43.740> 65<00:03:44.520> rated

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
RAB marez I rate also he was a 65 rated

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.190 
RAB marez I rate also he was a 65 rated
player<00:03:45.090> last<00:03:45.300> year<00:03:45.420> which<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.690> thought<00:03:45.810> was<00:03:45.930> so

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
player last year which I thought was so

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.620 
player last year which I thought was so
low<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:47.250> player<00:03:47.490> of<00:03:47.580> his<00:03:47.640> quality<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.510> I've

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
low for a player of his quality so I've

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.800 
low for a player of his quality so I've
given<00:03:48.900> him<00:03:49.020> a<00:03:49.230> 72<00:03:50.160> he<00:03:50.700> could<00:03:50.970> also<00:03:51.150> push<00:03:51.600> on

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
given him a 72 he could also push on

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.990 
given him a 72 he could also push on
higher<00:03:51.990> than<00:03:52.230> 72<00:03:52.800> because<00:03:53.280> as<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.550> said<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
higher than 72 because as I said in the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.850 
higher than 72 because as I said in the
previous<00:03:54.420> hour<00:03:54.840> before<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.380> faith<00:03:55.560> were

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
previous hour before the faith were

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.730 
previous hour before the faith were
people<00:03:56.340> even<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.760> UH<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.690> ratings<00:03:58.110> came<00:03:58.320> up<00:03:58.560> I

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
people even the UH the ratings came up I

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.950 
people even the UH the ratings came up I
didn't<00:03:59.280> say<00:03:59.400> he<00:03:59.610> was<00:03:59.790> starting<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.450> outshine

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
didn't say he was starting to outshine

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.910 
didn't say he was starting to outshine
kanaka<00:04:01.410> on<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.680> other<00:04:01.800> side<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.250> pitch<00:04:02.430> so

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
kanaka on the other side of the pitch so

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.200 
kanaka on the other side of the pitch so
the<00:04:04.920> only<00:04:05.130> reason<00:04:05.460> I've<00:04:05.550> given<00:04:05.910> knock<00:04:06.030> out<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
the only reason I've given knock out a

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.090 
the only reason I've given knock out a
higher<00:04:06.420> rating<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.900> because<00:04:07.200> he<00:04:07.440> was<00:04:08.070> a

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
higher rating is because he was a

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.660 
higher rating is because he was a
originally<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.300> higher<00:04:09.540> rating<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:10.230> 5th<00:04:11.010> 14<00:04:11.400> so

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
originally a higher rating in 5th 14 so

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.430 
originally a higher rating in 5th 14 so
the<00:04:12.240> increase<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.780> from<00:04:12.990> getting<00:04:13.200> into<00:04:13.320> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the increase is from getting into the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.960 
the increase is from getting into the
Premier<00:04:13.560> League<00:04:13.710> would<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.100> think<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:14.880> about

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
Premier League would I think just about

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.160 
Premier League would I think just about
keep<00:04:15.240> knock<00:04:15.420> out<00:04:15.540> her<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> wouldn't<00:04:16.109> be

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
keep knock out her but I wouldn't be

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.920 
keep knock out her but I wouldn't be
surprised<00:04:16.500> if<00:04:16.739> knockout<00:04:17.730> Amara's<00:04:18.210> were<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
surprised if knockout Amara's were the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.810 
surprised if knockout Amara's were the
same<00:04:19.080> rank<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.590> jar<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.160> said<00:04:20.370> proving
