hello how you doing everyone in this

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.290 
hello how you doing everyone in this
video<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.700> showing<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.120> to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
video I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.050 
video I'm going to be showing you how to
remove<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.750> oil<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.560> push<00:00:04.770> lawnmower<00:00:05.060> so

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
remove the oil in a push lawnmower so

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.849 
remove the oil in a push lawnmower so
most<00:00:06.299> engines<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.899> these<00:00:07.049> push<00:00:07.259> la<00:00:07.440> modes<00:00:07.710> are

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
most engines in these push la modes are

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.830 
most engines in these push la modes are
fairly<00:00:08.099> similar<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.730> it'll<00:00:09.450> be<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> fairly

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
fairly similar and it'll be a fairly

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.810 
fairly similar and it'll be a fairly
similar<00:00:10.260> procedure<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.250> draining<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.700> oil

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
similar procedure the draining the oil

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.930 
similar procedure the draining the oil
so<00:00:12.809> if<00:00:12.929> your<00:00:13.080> engine<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.650> runner<00:00:14.009> then<00:00:14.460> one

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
so if your engine is a runner then one

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.790 
so if your engine is a runner then one
good<00:00:15.210> thing<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.289> run<00:00:16.410> out<00:00:16.619> for

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
good thing to do is to just run out for

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.010 
good thing to do is to just run out for
a<00:00:16.859> bit<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.880> too<00:00:18.029> long<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.750> warm<00:00:18.930> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
a bit not for too long just to warm it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.200 
a bit not for too long just to warm it
up<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:20.189> will<00:00:20.340> thin<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> oil<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.090> make

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
up and this will thin the oil and make

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.640 
up and this will thin the oil and make
it<00:00:21.359> easy<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> drain<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.140> will<00:00:22.230> also<00:00:22.439> drain

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it easy to drain it will also drain

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980 
it easy to drain it will also drain
quicker<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:23.970> remember<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> sump

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
quicker but just remember that the sump

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
quicker but just remember that the sump
plug<00:00:25.109> will<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.560> hot<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.369> will<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> oil<00:00:26.760> so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
plug will be hot and so will the oil so

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.810 
plug will be hot and so will the oil so
don't<00:00:27.330> burn<00:00:27.510> yourself<00:00:28.010> first<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
don't burn yourself first of all you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.339 
don't burn yourself first of all you
need<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> remove<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> spark<00:00:30.570> plug<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
need to remove the spark plug this is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.870 
need to remove the spark plug this is
vital<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:32.009> working<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.610> small

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
vital when working on these small

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.819 
vital when working on these small
engines<00:00:35.690> next<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.930> need<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> tip<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.620> mower

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
engines next you need to tip your mower

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
engines next you need to tip your mower
back<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.420> pads<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> back<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
back now you can put pads on the back of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.190 
back now you can put pads on the back of
the<00:00:40.379> handle<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.890> doesn't<00:00:41.190> scratch<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
the handle so doesn't scratch them and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.569 
the handle so doesn't scratch them and
then<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.469> gain<00:00:43.620> access<00:00:43.829> underneath<00:00:44.370> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
then you can gain access underneath it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.479 
then you can gain access underneath it
and<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.750> underneath<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> mower<00:00:46.710> now

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and here we are underneath the mower now

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
and here we are underneath the mower now
because<00:00:47.850> we've<00:00:48.030> removed<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.510> bar<00:00:48.719> plug<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
because we've removed this bar plug it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
because we've removed this bar plug it's
safe<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.829> under<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:50.910> no

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
safe to be under here because there's no

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.869 
safe to be under here because there's no
chance<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.750> engine<00:00:52.110> starting<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.879> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
chance of this engine starting up so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
chance of this engine starting up so
this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> drain<00:00:54.719> plug<00:00:54.870> under<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.379> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
this is the drain plug under here this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
this is the drain plug under here this
is<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> bottom<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> sump<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is on the bottom of the sump which is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
is on the bottom of the sump which is
where<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> engine<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.980> attached<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
where the engine is attached to the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
where the engine is attached to the
chassis<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.320> deck<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> may<00:01:02.129> call<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
oil in now I've got one of these drain

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
oil in now I've got one of these drain
pans<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:07.619> cheap<00:01:07.860> wherever<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.460> in

the world and they're very handy for

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
the world and they're very handy for
putting<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.650> oil<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
putting your oil in so just put that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570 
putting your oil in so just put that
underneath<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.810> mower<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.400> then<00:01:14.400> get

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
underneath the mower like that then get

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
underneath the mower like that then get
your<00:01:14.729> socket<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.560> drain<00:01:16.799> your

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
your socket and then you can drain your

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.510 
your socket and then you can drain your
oil<00:01:17.119> now<00:01:18.200> once<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.380> sump<00:01:19.650> plug<00:01:19.770> comes<00:01:20.310> out

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
oil now once this sump plug comes out

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
oil now once this sump plug comes out
make<00:01:21.509> sure<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.750> holding<00:01:21.869> onto<00:01:22.110> its

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
make sure you're holding onto its

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.780 
make sure you're holding onto its
otherwise<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:22.890> fall<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> oil<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
otherwise it will fall into the oil and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
otherwise it will fall into the oil and
then<00:01:24.570> once<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> oil<00:01:25.350> starts<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> drain<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then once the oil starts to drain you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
then once the oil starts to drain you
can<00:01:26.549> lower<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> mower<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.799> just<00:01:28.799> leave<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
can lower it the mower and just leave it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:53.060 
can lower it the mower and just leave it
to<00:01:29.220> drain

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 

and<00:01:53.160> as<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> say<00:01:54.150> now<00:01:54.480> because<00:01:54.750> we've<00:01:54.870> removed

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and as I say now because we've removed

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.110 
and as I say now because we've removed
the<00:01:55.260> drain<00:01:55.500> plug<00:01:56.010> just<00:01:56.400> keep<00:01:56.580> your<00:01:56.670> drain<00:01:56.880> pan

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
the drain plug just keep your drain pan

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.180
