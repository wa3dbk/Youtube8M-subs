and<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> reason<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> if

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and this is the reason for this if

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.100 
and this is the reason for this if
they're<00:00:33.180> concentrating<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> lot<00:00:33.780> more<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
they're concentrating a lot more on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.979

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.330 

right<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.200> would<00:00:40.559> define<00:00:41.570> toddlers<00:00:42.649> like<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
right I would define toddlers like the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660 
right I would define toddlers like the
toddler<00:00:44.730> stage<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.120> life<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:46.399> core<00:00:47.399> gameplay

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
toddler stage of life as core gameplay

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.549 
toddler stage of life as core gameplay
right<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:48.840> being<00:00:49.170> called<00:00:49.410> games

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
right that that's being called games

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
right that that's being called games
like<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> last<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.190> games<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.850> stage<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.870> life

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
like the last two games a stage of life

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
like the last two games a stage of life
would<00:00:52.949> pretty<00:00:53.280> much<00:00:53.370> always<00:00:53.789> by<00:00:54.000> definition

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
would pretty much always by definition

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.799 
would pretty much always by definition
be<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> core<00:00:55.199> feature<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.600> they're<00:00:57.780> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
be a core feature and if they're just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.979 
be a core feature and if they're just
cutting<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.739> more<00:00:59.070> animations

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
cutting it for more animations

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
cutting it for more animations
priorities<00:01:00.989> also<00:01:01.850> project<00:01:02.850> mismanagement<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
priorities also project mismanagement I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
priorities also project mismanagement I
mean<00:01:03.480> seriously<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.010> competence

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
mean seriously that's just in competence

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.070

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
if you're saying oh we're cutting it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
if you're saying oh we're cutting it
because<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> more<00:01:08.070> animations<00:01:08.490> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
because we want the more animations in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.690 
because we want the more animations in
it's<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.820> well<00:01:09.000> why<00:01:09.750> did<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.140> both<00:01:10.320> I
