00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.990
 Change the pattern of the right-handed version using the four actions you learned in the first movie 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.880
 As for code that you remember well , for the time being it is good of major seventh as it is 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.780
 Let's practice by changing this arpeggio putter on the right hand 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.329
 If you say what kind of pattern, it is pulled a little once 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 Like this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.390
 The rhythm of a little here Rahen I feel that 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.450
 I this do you also but this set I have changed a little rhythm 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.450

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.440
 It is a rhythm like this 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.890
 I don't think that's really difficult 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:36.950
 The technique is not so difficult technically but this 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:43.380
 I think that wonder if a little hard to put this I wonder if I say relaxed atmosphere 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.970
 Looking at quite a few different forms and 8 common mistakes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:35.300
