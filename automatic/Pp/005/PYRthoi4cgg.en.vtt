hostile<00:02:26.900> mob<00:02:27.049> because<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.380> know<00:02:27.470> not<00:02:27.680> all

little<00:05:13.419> scaly<00:05:14.419> stripes<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.050> guess<00:05:15.200> could<00:05:15.380> call

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
little scaly stripes I guess could call

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.050 
little scaly stripes I guess could call
it<00:05:15.919> also<00:05:16.130> it<00:05:16.460> looks<00:05:16.610> like<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.729> Tyrannosaurus

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
it also it looks like a Tyrannosaurus

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.450 
it also it looks like a Tyrannosaurus
Rex<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.720> he<00:05:17.780> has<00:05:17.900> his<00:05:17.990> arms<00:05:18.320> short<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.250> up

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
Rex and he has his arms short and up

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.640 
Rex and he has his arms short and up
there<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:20.030> also<00:05:20.630> I'll<00:05:21.080> think<00:05:21.320> it's<00:05:21.410> a<00:05:21.470> pretty

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
there and also I'll think it's a pretty

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.350 
there and also I'll think it's a pretty
cool<00:05:21.770> idea<00:05:22.010> if<00:05:22.250> they<00:05:22.370> actually<00:05:22.729> bend<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.150> body

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
cool idea if they actually bend the body

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.600 
cool idea if they actually bend the body
a<00:05:23.479> little<00:05:23.539> it<00:05:23.900> looks<00:05:23.930> kind<00:05:24.350> of<00:05:24.410> they<00:05:25.160> look<00:05:25.310> too
