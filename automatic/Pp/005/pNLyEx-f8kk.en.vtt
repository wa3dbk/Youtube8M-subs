00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.630
 Today I 'm going to talk about the flash ttl 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.630
 welcome to 8 tv 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.180
 how about friends welcome to a new 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.710
 episode of luge or tv my name is 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.350
 luciano hipÃ³lito and today I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.090
 about the clan this l before starting 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.700
 I want to apologize for the delay 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.920
 in the publication of new lessons of 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.410
 tv fight has already been two months since 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.780
 that I published the last one and really what 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.390
 I am very sorry this has been due 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.360
 mainly to that I'm with enough 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.120
 work and I do not have enough time in 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.309
 Free time book to publish or 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.170
 prepare new lessons but 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.570
 I promise that as long as I go 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.940
 vacating I will go publishing new 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.680
 lessons please do not think of any 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.780
 moment that I abandoned the project 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.820
 because it is not like that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 when we talk about small flashes or 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.159
 battery flashes which are mounted 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.379
 just above the camera we have three 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.600
 modes or there are three work modes 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.370
 These modes are automatic and manual ttl 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 depending on the brand and model of your 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.520
 flash it can work in one or 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.510
 two of these modes for example here 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.350
 I have 430 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:30.100
 xd cano that works in tl and manual 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.380
 this which is the avoid 285 hb works in 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.820
 automatic and manual 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.399
 and this one is the ion 1 560 works 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 only in manual in this episode 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.810
 I will explain how the mode works 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.670
 ttl and the next two lessons are the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.310
 I will devote to manual mode and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.470
 automatic the particularity of the engine 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.049
 ttl is that the camera and the flash 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.210
 they share information between them 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.030
 in fact the measurement of light does not the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.679
 does the flash but the camera does not 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.390
 imports the exposure values â€‹â€‹that 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.850
 has defined the user when 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.979
 we work on tl the flash tries to achieve 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 a correct exposure for any 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.349
 diaphragm speed value x or that 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.660
 we have defined this means that 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.750
 working between tele is as easy as 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.580
 turn on the camera turn on the flash 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.069
 focus and shoot 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 that's all in fact between this one is the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.560
 working mode with flash easier than 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.560
 there is 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.430
 I want to invite you to subscribe to the classroom 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.860
 virtual fight tv from which we have 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.500
 live sessions every 15 days the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.689
 service is very economical and I offer 30 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.269
 Test days for you to attend one or 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.690
 two sessions and evaluate if you like it or not 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.390
 if you like you stay and if you do not cancel the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.250
 Subscription and nothing happened for more 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.660
 information about this service visit 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.370
 the link you see on the screen 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.170
 from this moment I am going to 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.000
 implement a new type of episode of 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.190
 fight tv that is going to be about criticism 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.690
 photographic so if you want that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.160
 evaluate your photographs 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.650
 please send me your 10 best 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.170
 images by mail to info at 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.180
 luciano hipÃ³lito dotcom and I will make a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.130
 choice with your photos the most 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.130
 soon possible thank you very much 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.239
 There are some situations where 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 measuring system of our camera is 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.590
 may confuse resulting 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.170
 photographs a bit clear or a little 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.120
 dark to remedy this we have the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.280
 exposure compensation mechanism 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.049
 of the flash the way to apply said 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.180
 compensation varies among the various 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.269
 flash models but in the case of 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.519
 this which is close 430 x is made of the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.159
 next way I have a button be a 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.709
 button plus and one button less when 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.930
 press the set button starts blinking 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.599
 the symbol of compensation of 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.970
 exposure of the flash with a +0 to the side 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.879
 if I want the next flash to be 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.099
 more powerful I have to go towards a 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.400
 positive value notice that there I have more 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.480
 one third plus two thirds plus one and 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.810
 I can continue 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.269
 3 if instead I want the next 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.799
 Flash flash is less powerful 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.989
 I have to go towards the negative values 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.540
 then I go through zero 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.359
 I keep pushing and look the least I 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:24.210
 minus two thirds minus one minus 11 with 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:29.560
 one third and I can get up to minus 3 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.290
 once we have reached the value that 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.350
 we wish we go back to press the button 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.120
 cited set and that's the compensation of 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.510
 Flash exposure that is going to 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.720
 apply to this next photograph as 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.669
 have seen this flash close 430 x 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.310
 allows a position compensation of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.620
 flash of plus or minus three steps but 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.110
 this value may vary depending on the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.150
 isolated model that you have what 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.760
 important here is that they know that everything 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.680
 flash ttl has compensation of 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.750
 exposure of the flash and that is important 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.210
 that they master it and that they use it 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.940
 and as a general culture it is important that 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.940
 know that the pop frax of the camera or 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.330
 be this little one that you see here also 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.120
 it works in ttl given its ease of use 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.190
 the TV mode is ideal for users 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.160
 both beginners and professionals 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.560
 in ttl we can photograph a wide 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.750
 range of photographic situations that go 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.120
 from family photograph through 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.450
 social events modeling photography 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.520
 parades etcetera one thing that I forgot 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.400
 tell them to work between tele 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.900
 they should use a dedicated flash this 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.330
 means that it must be 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.810
 manufactured specifically for the model 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.669
 or for the brand of your camera 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.010
 that's why we come to the end of this 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.580
 lesson I am luciano hipolito and now 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.889
 I leave 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.900
 thank you very much for having accompanied one 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.800
 great hug and see you in the next 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.800
 bye
