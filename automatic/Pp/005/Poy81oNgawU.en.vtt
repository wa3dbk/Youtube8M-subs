00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
end on but you take one end up and this

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.430 
end on but you take one end up and this
is<00:02:36.270> what<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.720> look<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.230> looks

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
so cool so anyway so then you take a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.360 
so cool so anyway so then you take a
bowl<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.840> put<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> rice<00:02:43.710> or<00:02:44.070> whatever

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
on the inside and then you slowly pour

00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:11.990 
on the inside and then you slowly pour
this<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.840> listen<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.610> put<00:03:11.760> one

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
this in and listen now you can put one

this in and listen now you can put one
cup<00:03:12.300> or<00:03:12.570> two<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.470> if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.880> test<00:03:15.239> out

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
cup or two and if you want to test out

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.170 
cup or two and if you want to test out
to<00:03:15.720> see<00:03:15.900> what<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.170> sounds<00:03:16.620> like<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.000> put

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
to see what it sounds like you can put

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.080 
to see what it sounds like you can put
the<00:03:18.300> top<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.140> one<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.590> made<00:03:20.090> has

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the top on now the one that I made has

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.790 
the top on now the one that I made has
two<00:03:21.480> cups<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> what<00:03:22.709> it

two cups in it and this is what it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.640 
two cups in it and this is what it
sounds<00:03:23.190> like

the amount of grain in your tube that
you<00:04:43.520> want<00:04:43.820> then<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.690> can<00:04:44.840> take<00:04:45.169> whatever

telling you they make all different
kinds<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.830> colors<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.930> secure<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.080> ends<00:04:51.410> of

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
kinds of colors and secure the ends of

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.770 
kinds of colors and secure the ends of
them<00:04:51.710> first<00:04:52.010> before<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.789> start<00:04:52.820> wrapping<00:04:54.099> the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
them first before you start wrapping the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.409 
them first before you start wrapping the
tube<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:58.160> we'll<00:04:58.310> show<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.580> how<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.880> do<00:04:59.120> that

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.490 

so<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.510> secure<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.410> end<00:05:03.650> with<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.729> duct<00:05:05.000> tape

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
so you secure the end with the duct tape

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.310 
so you secure the end with the duct tape
so<00:05:06.500> that<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.830> end<00:05:06.979> won't<00:05:07.190> fall<00:05:07.460> off<00:05:08.139> no<00:05:09.139> you

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
so that the end won't fall off no you

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.570 
so that the end won't fall off no you
got<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.710> do<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:09.979> this<00:05:10.099> way<00:05:10.280> q<00:05:10.490> yep

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
got to do it on this way q yep

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:21.610 
got to do it on this way q yep
and<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.960> can<00:05:15.169> be<00:05:15.289> the<00:05:15.410> tricky<00:05:15.740> part<00:05:15.949> so

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.770 

but<00:05:22.310> this<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.669> fun<00:05:22.880> because<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.240> mean<00:05:23.389> what<00:05:23.510> kid

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
but this is fun because I mean what kid

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:33.310 
but this is fun because I mean what kid
doesn't<00:05:24.020> love<00:05:24.350> tape<00:05:25.040> right<00:05:30.760> perfect<00:05:31.760> so<00:05:32.750> take

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
doesn't love tape right perfect so take

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.360 
doesn't love tape right perfect so take
both<00:05:33.590> ends<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.400> then<00:05:34.699> we'll<00:05:34.910> start<00:05:35.180> wrapping

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
both ends and then we'll start wrapping

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.850 
both ends and then we'll start wrapping
okay<00:05:37.370> once<00:05:37.760> both<00:05:38.479> ends<00:05:39.380> are<00:05:40.630> taped<00:05:41.630> then<00:05:42.560> you

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
okay once both ends are taped then you

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:51.070 
okay once both ends are taped then you
can<00:05:43.160> start<00:05:43.460> wrapping<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:49.690> that's<00:05:50.690> pretty<00:05:50.900> much

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
can start wrapping it that's pretty much

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.439 
can start wrapping it that's pretty much
it<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.350> keep<00:05:52.220> wrapping<00:05:52.790> and<00:05:52.940> wrapping<00:05:52.970> until

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
it you keep wrapping and wrapping until

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:05.920 
it you keep wrapping and wrapping until
you<00:05:53.840> get<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:54.560> end<00:06:02.590> and<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:05.150> beauty<00:06:05.570> with

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
you get to the end and the beauty with

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.500 
you get to the end and the beauty with
the<00:06:06.289> cool<00:06:06.830> colored<00:06:07.310> duct<00:06:07.580> tapes<00:06:07.910> is<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.360> you

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
the cool colored duct tapes is that you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.930 
the cool colored duct tapes is that you
can<00:06:08.720> do<00:06:08.870> all<00:06:09.080> different<00:06:10.690> designs<00:06:11.690> and

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
can do all different designs and

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:21.610 
can do all different designs and
patterns<00:06:13.940> and<00:06:14.660> whatnot<00:06:20.110> now<00:06:21.110> one<00:06:21.410> of<00:06:21.440> the

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
patterns and whatnot now one of the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.980 
patterns and whatnot now one of the
reasons<00:06:21.800> why<00:06:22.160> we<00:06:22.430> make<00:06:22.639> rain<00:06:23.030> sticks<00:06:23.600> at<00:06:23.840> this

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
reasons why we make rain sticks at this

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.390 
reasons why we make rain sticks at this
time<00:06:24.229> of<00:06:24.440> year<00:06:24.470> is<00:06:25.990> because<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.440> spring<00:06:27.950> rains

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
time of year is because the spring rains

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.430 
time of year is because the spring rains
help<00:06:29.389> melt<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:34.099> snow<00:06:34.490> and<00:06:35.030> it<00:06:35.990> nourishes

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
help melt the the snow and it nourishes

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.370 
help melt the the snow and it nourishes
and<00:06:37.099> quenches<00:06:38.060> the<00:06:38.419> seeds<00:06:38.750> that<00:06:38.990> are<00:06:39.169> down

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
and quenches the seeds that are down

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.140 
and quenches the seeds that are down
below<00:06:39.590> and<00:06:40.270> with<00:06:41.270> this<00:06:41.570> rain<00:06:42.020> and<00:06:42.050> water<00:06:43.150> that

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
below and with this rain and water that

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.680 
below and with this rain and water that
the<00:06:44.270> spring<00:06:44.630> rains<00:06:44.900> bring<00:06:45.320> that<00:06:46.220> helps<00:06:46.789> awaken

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
the spring rains bring that helps awaken

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.050 
the spring rains bring that helps awaken
the<00:06:48.229> seeds<00:06:48.650> that<00:06:48.950> are<00:06:49.010> deep<00:06:49.520> within<00:06:49.700> the<00:06:49.910> earth

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
the seeds that are deep within the earth

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:58.540 
the seeds that are deep within the earth
and<00:06:50.419> they'll<00:06:50.570> start<00:06:50.870> to<00:06:51.760> sprout<00:06:52.760> roots<00:06:53.150> yeah

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.820 

we're<00:06:59.550> almost<00:06:59.790> done<00:07:00.419> with<00:07:00.479> this<00:07:00.840> one<00:07:01.199> looks

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
we're almost done with this one looks

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:11.029 
we're almost done with this one looks
very<00:07:02.220> cool<00:07:05.690> yay<00:07:06.979> so<00:07:07.979> this<00:07:08.970> is<00:07:09.330> what<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:10.259> rain

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
very cool yay so this is what the rain

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.439 
very cool yay so this is what the rain
sticks<00:07:11.340> look<00:07:11.460> like<00:07:11.699> when<00:07:12.060> they're<00:07:12.330> finished

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.449 
sticks look like when they're finished

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.290 
sticks look like when they're finished
and<00:07:12.840> like<00:07:13.050> I<00:07:13.139> said<00:07:13.380> you<00:07:13.710> know<00:07:13.860> the<00:07:14.610> sky<00:07:14.850> is<00:07:14.910> the

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
and like I said you know the sky is the

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.620 
and like I said you know the sky is the
limit<00:07:15.690> for<00:07:16.610> the<00:07:17.610> colors<00:07:18.000> and<00:07:18.570> everything

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
limit for the colors and everything

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.150 
limit for the colors and everything
because<00:07:19.380> there<00:07:19.530> are<00:07:19.590> so<00:07:19.710> many<00:07:19.740> different

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
because there are so many different

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.909 
because there are so many different
colors<00:07:20.220> of<00:07:20.490> duct<00:07:20.699> tape

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.460 

and<00:07:23.300> these<00:07:24.300> really<00:07:24.539> are<00:07:24.780> a<00:07:24.810> lot<00:07:25.020> of<00:07:25.139> fun<00:07:25.289> to

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
and these really are a lot of fun to

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.219 
and these really are a lot of fun to
make<00:07:25.650> not<00:07:26.580> very<00:07:26.970> expensive<00:07:27.419> the<00:07:27.810> rolls<00:07:28.020> of

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:28.229 
make not very expensive the rolls of

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.659 
make not very expensive the rolls of
duct<00:07:28.410> tape<00:07:28.470> I<00:07:28.919> think<00:07:29.430> we're<00:07:29.550> the<00:07:29.639> most

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669 
duct tape I think we're the most

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.750 
duct tape I think we're the most
expensive<00:07:30.389> part<00:07:30.660> um<00:07:31.020> I<00:07:31.800> think<00:07:32.370> they<00:07:32.699> were

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.760 
expensive part um I think they were

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.710 
expensive part um I think they were
about<00:07:34.250> well<00:07:35.250> yeah<00:07:35.940> I<00:07:35.970> think<00:07:36.150> they<00:07:36.389> were<00:07:36.449> like

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 
about well yeah I think they were like

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.570 
about well yeah I think they were like
six<00:07:37.020> dollars<00:07:37.410> for<00:07:37.440> each<00:07:37.740> roll<00:07:38.190> so<00:07:40.340> they<00:07:41.340> didn't

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 
six dollars for each roll so they didn't

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.100 
six dollars for each roll so they didn't
have<00:07:41.699> any<00:07:41.880> generic<00:07:42.240> brands<00:07:42.449> so<00:07:42.630> we<00:07:42.750> had<00:07:42.870> to<00:07:42.990> get
