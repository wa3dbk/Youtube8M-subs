other videos you you know that it's made
vine<00:00:21.869> by<00:00:22.109> our<00:00:22.230> Texas<00:00:22.710> same<00:00:23.010> people<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.400> make

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
vine by our Texas same people that make

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.019 
vine by our Texas same people that make
the<00:00:23.730> easy<00:00:23.910> test<00:00:24.269> resin<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.849> what<00:00:26.849> we're<00:00:27.000> doing

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the easy test resin and what we're doing

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
the easy test resin and what we're doing
is<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> take<00:00:28.199> equal<00:00:28.710> parts<00:00:28.769> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
is we're going to take equal parts of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.069 
is we're going to take equal parts of
both<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.450> making<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> ring

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
both and we're going to be making a ring

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.510 
both and we're going to be making a ring
today<00:00:36.020> it's<00:00:37.020> pretty<00:00:37.290> equal<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> me<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.460> I'm

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
today it's pretty equal to me so I'm

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.170 
today it's pretty equal to me so I'm
going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.760> close<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> B<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
going to close the a and a B so all you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.160 
going to close the a and a B so all you
want<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.570> roll<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.020> into<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> ball

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
want to do is roll these into a ball

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.549 
want to do is roll these into a ball
make<00:00:46.170> sure<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:47.760> equal<00:00:48.120> parts

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
make sure you have pretty equal parts

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
make sure you have pretty equal parts
look<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:49.860> equal<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> me<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:51.270> you're

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
look pretty equal to me and then you're

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.119 
look pretty equal to me and then you're
just<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> mix<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:52.050> together<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.949> when

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just going to mix them together and when

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.529 
just going to mix them together and when
you<00:00:53.190> mix<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.460> together<00:00:53.610> there's<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.329> type

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you mix them together there's some type

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
you mix them together there's some type
of<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.840> chemical<00:00:55.350> reaction<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.070> happens<00:00:56.940> over

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of a chemical reaction that happens over

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
of a chemical reaction that happens over
the<00:00:57.300> next<00:00:57.800> 12<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> 24<00:00:58.980> hours<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:01.219> allows<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the next 12 to 24 hours that allows it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.719 
the next 12 to 24 hours that allows it
to<00:01:02.489> harden<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.920> anything<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.040> put<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to harden and anything you put into it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.750 
to harden and anything you put into it
will<00:01:06.210> stay<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.369> need<00:01:08.610> any

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
will stay there and you don't need any

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
will stay there and you don't need any
additional<00:01:09.030> adhesive<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.229> main<00:01:10.470> thing<00:01:10.680> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
additional adhesive the main thing you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
additional adhesive the main thing you
need<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.220> remember<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:13.460> when<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.820> mixing

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
need to remember is when you are mixing

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
need to remember is when you are mixing
it<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.600> need<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> make<00:01:16.080> sure<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it you need to make sure that it is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.120 
it you need to make sure that it is
fully<00:01:17.220> mixed<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.950> any

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
fully mixed and that you don't have any

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
fully mixed and that you don't have any
any<00:01:20.670> different<00:01:21.270> colors<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
any different colors it's got to be a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
any different colors it's got to be a
uniform<00:01:22.650> color<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.610> make<00:01:23.759> sure<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.090> fully

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
uniform color to make sure it's fully

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600 
uniform color to make sure it's fully
mixed<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> chemical

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
mixed so it will have that chemical

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.770 
mixed so it will have that chemical
reaction<00:01:27.979> that's<00:01:28.979> pretty<00:01:29.250> good<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.540> don't

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
reaction that's pretty good so I don't

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
reaction that's pretty good so I don't
need<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> ton<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.890> ring<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> I'm

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
need a ton of it for the ring that I'm

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.020 
need a ton of it for the ring that I'm
doing<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:34.290> ring<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.729> elastic<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
doing and it this ring is elastic so it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.800 
doing and it this ring is elastic so it
will<00:01:36.090> fit<00:01:36.420> any<00:01:36.840> finger<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.479> could<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:39.780> on

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
will fit any finger and I could put on

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.420 
will fit any finger and I could put on
your<00:01:40.020> thumb<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.740> put<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.159> wherever

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
your thumb you can put it on wherever

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.679 
your thumb you can put it on wherever
and<00:01:43.340> what<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> wanted<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
dress up the front and wasn't really

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.830 
dress up the front and wasn't really
sure<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.060

pearl<00:03:39.820> ish<00:03:42.120> pigment<00:03:43.120> powder<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:46.390> I'm

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
pearl ish pigment powder and then I'm

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.300 
pearl ish pigment powder and then I'm
going<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:48.690> brush<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:50.050> over<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:51.100> ring

going to just brush it all over the ring
and<00:03:51.720> what<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:52.990> will<00:03:53.200> do<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:54.490> ring<00:03:54.700> the

clay suppose to dry a pearly white or a
porcelain<00:04:00.880> white<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.120> guess<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.890> just<00:04:03.100> kind

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
porcelain white I guess and I just kind

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.010 
porcelain white I guess and I just kind
of<00:04:03.400> wanted<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.790> dress<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.240> up<00:04:04.360> maybe<00:04:04.510> just<00:04:04.870> that

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
of wanted to dress it up maybe just that

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.950 
of wanted to dress it up maybe just that
little<00:04:05.170> bit<00:04:05.350> more<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:07.090> I've<00:04:07.180> taken<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.600> pearl

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
little bit more so I've taken the pearl

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.400 
little bit more so I've taken the pearl
powder<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:08.890> put<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.340> all<00:04:09.550> over<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.940> ring

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
and this should be sticking to the clay

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.539 
and this should be sticking to the clay
and<00:04:15.630> in<00:04:16.630> about<00:04:16.900> 12<00:04:17.410> hours<00:04:17.620> we'll<00:04:18.010> brush<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.400> off

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
and we will see the reveal the brain has

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.980 
and we will see the reveal the brain has
cured<00:04:21.790> and<00:04:21.970> now<00:04:22.060> all<00:04:22.300> I'm<00:04:22.390> going<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.570> do<00:04:22.810> is
