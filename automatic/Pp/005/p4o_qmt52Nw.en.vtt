00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.350

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.900
 I have not told you how but I have 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.080
 managed to get it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.510
 we see here it's not him so here 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.820
 three two one 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.809
 So here I have the pokemon 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.989
 719 pokédex so she rock type 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.540
 is done then everything is a crazy the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.800
 all the censors him her size she 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.180
 is 70 cm tall 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 do not suck I'm wrong or seven 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.079
 matches it's not good it's fast with 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.840
 the 8 kg yeah I do not know and so that's it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 it's a pokemon jewel so its 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 description we can create a multitude 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 of diamond to the wandering instance and has me 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 simply that we press the molecules 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:13.340
 of carbon in the air so that's it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:20.939
 so unknown areas that then heard 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:31.520
 how good it is there are created 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 are rotten that's it so now 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.360
 good then ben ah good you can me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 pass amy's vocals 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.430
 if you want in the comments 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 because look at the number I have 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.229
 I have to 6 10 years so so four Japanese 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.600
 and two English 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.470
 so I do not have french quincy because 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.439
 that it is not possible 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.659
 so here is if an access interests 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.430
 I can give some 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.560
 so here I am soon a mathieu 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.460
 cited the site acca 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.130
 but I do not think we can 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.010
 change so here are the attacks 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.760
 that he has buses are 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.780
 and I have them all the time obvious that 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.750
 early I think there is offside 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.950
 especially term lunar power back 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.790
 and protection so that's then less 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.100
 that one I'm nice so so a 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.660
 so without talent these healthy body prevents 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.610
 the stages of pokémon to lower so that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.530
 it's good 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.450
 then it is very good in defense 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.960
 special defense pv it is not bad 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.330
 speed he's not good finally he was moving 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.940
 anyway and so his signature attack 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.690
 low and thunderstorms adamantine an attack 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.540
 of a rock type attack and so me 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.160
 I gave him look at this object so 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.680
 the weird trinket so I do not know to 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.660
 what's the point but in any case I'm going 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.190
 give so if you tell me in the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.920
 comments it serves for something not 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.780
 do not know and so that's what he has at 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.700
 start in the nature blizzard 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.550
 apparently encountered by the force of 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.170
 destiny level 50 provenance movie of 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.510
 pokemon 2014 so that's it so if you do not 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.130
 do not want to have it right away 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.070
 will have an event via an event in 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.450
 verb to huy around August or September so 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.480
 on an event you can receive 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.459
 dance he is holding stands bossuet street 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:45.110
 ribot ribbon supposed to grant wishes 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:52.220
 so here is after so so here you are 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:56.620
 will receive September I believe and then I 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.620
 will show you these attacks 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:06.380
 so his attack is mostly his 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:09.310
 attack fetish way I have not so 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.310
 I come across a kennel 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:18.940
 so so here I have also so 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.590
 so his attack is 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:47.879
 mental jada so that was me a lot 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.139
