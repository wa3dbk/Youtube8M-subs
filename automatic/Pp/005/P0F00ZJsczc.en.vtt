that<00:00:31.250> i<00:00:31.340> didn't<00:00:31.640> use<00:00:31.790> this<00:00:31.910> gameplay<00:00:32.150> a<00:00:32.419> long

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
that i didn't use this gameplay a long

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.200 
that i didn't use this gameplay a long
time<00:00:32.930> ago<00:00:33.079> when<00:00:33.650> i<00:00:33.710> first<00:00:33.770> got<00:00:34.130> it<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:34.670> i<00:00:35.030> got

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
time ago when i first got it and i got

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.090 
time ago when i first got it and i got
this<00:00:35.360> gameplay<00:00:35.600> about<00:00:36.020> four<00:00:36.320> months<00:00:36.500> ago<00:00:36.890> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
this gameplay about four months ago and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.580 
this gameplay about four months ago and
the<00:00:37.400> reason<00:00:37.730> for<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:38.000> is<00:00:38.180> because<00:00:38.390> dark<00:00:39.290> star

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
the reason for that is because dark star

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.560 
the reason for that is because dark star
2<00:00:39.890> or<00:00:40.070> nine<00:00:40.310> one<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.820> guys<00:00:40.969> we<00:00:41.180> play<00:00:41.420> with

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
2 or nine one of the guys we play with

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.510 
2 or nine one of the guys we play with
on<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> regular<00:00:41.870> basis<00:00:42.590> was<00:00:43.039> on<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.340> other<00:00:43.370> team

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
on a regular basis was on the other team

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.130 
on a regular basis was on the other team
but<00:00:44.300> then<00:00:44.390> i<00:00:44.449> looked<00:00:44.629> back<00:00:44.719> to<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.960> gameplay

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
but then i looked back to the gameplay

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.810 
but then i looked back to the gameplay
and<00:00:45.500> he<00:00:45.559> was<00:00:45.649> running<00:00:45.859> out<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.070> striker<00:00:46.430> trying

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
and he was running out to striker trying

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.000 
and he was running out to striker trying
to<00:00:46.879> kill<00:00:47.090> us<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.420> troll<00:00:47.690> us<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.440> i<00:00:48.469> don't

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
to kill us and troll us so i don't

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.009 
to kill us and troll us so i don't
really<00:00:49.129> think<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:49.489> this<00:00:49.969> gameplay<00:00:50.570> got<00:00:50.870> hurt

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
really think that this gameplay got hurt

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.810 
really think that this gameplay got hurt
by<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.980> just<00:00:52.250> because<00:00:52.519> i<00:00:52.550> didn't

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
by that it's just because i didn't

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.430 
by that it's just because i didn't
really<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.539> know<00:00:53.629> think<00:00:53.809> about<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.410> know

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
really you know think about you know

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.680 
really you know think about you know
counting<00:00:55.100> up<00:00:55.250> my<00:00:55.429> Mobe<00:00:55.699> or<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.210> know<00:00:56.300> timing

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
counting up my Mobe or you know timing

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.959 
counting up my Mobe or you know timing
my<00:00:56.780> moves<00:00:57.050> back<00:00:57.679> when<00:00:57.859> I<00:00:57.890> got<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.250> gameplay<00:00:58.519> I

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
my moves back when I got this gameplay I

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.299 
my moves back when I got this gameplay I
believe<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.809> Mobe<00:01:00.019> clocked<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.710> around<00:01:01.129> a

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
believe the Mobe clocked in around a

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.790 
believe the Mobe clocked in around a
minute<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:01.850> 40<00:01:02.179> seconds<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.500> was<00:01:03.679> about

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
minute and 40 seconds and this was about

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.320 
minute and 40 seconds and this was about
four<00:01:04.070> months<00:01:04.190> ago<00:01:04.370> before<00:01:04.519> all<00:01:04.850> those<00:01:05.000> quad

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
four months ago before all those quad

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.060 
four months ago before all those quad
modes<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.870> Pinta<00:01:06.140> mopes<00:01:06.350> came<00:01:06.590> out<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:06.920> this

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
modes and Pinta mopes came out so this

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.100 
modes and Pinta mopes came out so this
would<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.280> gun<00:01:07.550> or<00:01:07.940> done<00:01:08.390> really<00:01:08.810> good<00:01:08.840> on

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
would a gun or done really good on

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.440 
would a gun or done really good on
YouTube<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:09.710> anyways<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.760> is<00:01:10.820> my<00:01:11.000> fastest

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
YouTube but anyways this is my fastest

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.480 
YouTube but anyways this is my fastest
mo<00:01:11.630> better<00:01:11.870> and<00:01:12.260> playing<00:01:12.680> 66<00:01:13.250> Kill<00:01:13.460> Confirmed

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.640 
mo better and playing 66 Kill Confirmed
I<00:01:14.030> think<00:01:14.210> it's<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:14.360> pretty<00:01:14.600> damn<00:01:14.990> wall<00:01:15.229> time<00:01:15.500> to

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
I think it's a pretty damn wall time to

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.590 
I think it's a pretty damn wall time to
mope<00:01:15.829> playing<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.820> know<00:01:16.909> this<00:01:17.090> regular<00:01:17.450> Kill

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
mope playing you know this regular Kill

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.940 
mope playing you know this regular Kill
Confirmed<00:01:17.630> because<00:01:18.320> there<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.560> no<00:01:18.710> spawn

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
Confirmed because there is no spawn

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.249 
Confirmed because there is no spawn
trapped<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.549> kill<00:01:19.700> confirm<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.329> there's

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
trapped and kill confirm and there's

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.899

less<00:01:21.439> people<00:01:21.829> in<00:01:21.890> 6v6<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:22.549> I'd<00:01:22.640> really<00:01:22.790> think

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
less people in 6v6 so I'd really think

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.149
