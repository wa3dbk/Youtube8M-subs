appeal<00:03:19.510> thing<00:03:19.750> um<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.560> think<00:03:20.620> it's<00:03:20.889> a<00:03:21.010> little

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
appeal thing um I think it's a little

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.589 
appeal thing um I think it's a little
bit<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.810> he's<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.470> great<00:03:23.889> guy<00:03:24.310> he<00:03:25.030> is

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
bit of that he's a is a great guy he is

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.839 
bit of that he's a is a great guy he is
very<00:03:26.500> strict<00:03:26.980> with<00:03:27.069> his<00:03:27.220> morals<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.730> his

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
very strict with his morals and his

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.460 
very strict with his morals and his
beliefs<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.540> think<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.930> attracts<00:03:29.410> people

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
beliefs and I think that attracts people

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.589 
beliefs and I think that attracts people
it<00:03:29.889> definitely<00:03:30.370> does<00:03:30.579> he<00:03:30.970> definitely<00:03:31.389> is<00:03:31.480> but

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
it definitely does he definitely is but

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.089 
it definitely does he definitely is but
I<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.720> found<00:03:32.169> when<00:03:32.319> I've<00:03:32.410> met<00:03:32.590> him<00:03:32.739> before<00:03:32.829> he

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
I I found when I've met him before he

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.979 
I I found when I've met him before he
seems<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.880> guess<00:03:34.180> he's<00:03:34.329> kind<00:03:34.359> of<00:03:34.540> standoffish
