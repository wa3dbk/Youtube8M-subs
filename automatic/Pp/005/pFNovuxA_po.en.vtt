00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.870
 have seen friends who, as they say, 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.820
 comfort what a beautiful terrace 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.610

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.970
 it is clear the grass that I have in my 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.109
 terrace is natural or is artificial from 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.890
 then you have to touch it to realize 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.650
 that it's artificial that really 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 that we have on our feet is something without 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.150
 maintenance we do not need water no 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.430

 hydric this ecologically speaking is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 delicious and I think all all 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.500

 terrace have seen that good job what 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.040
 true is that we had 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.270

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.800
 first place in the park have extended 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.410
 the very long carpet strips 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.870
 artificial turf that as I was saying is 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.150
 very difficult to discern if 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.220
 natural or artificial so thick and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.650

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.500
 had to overlap the lips is to say 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.840
 the strips of grass have to be glued together 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.129

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.550

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:33.989
 body with it we have finished the work 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.409
