 product of the brand ryser in this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.380
 occasion is a country called by weaver the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 truth is that he is very father or music 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.740
 they go a little take out the possibilities of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.360
 the box so you can see them this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 person since he has an infrastructure 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.790
 of mechanical keys what is the option 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 to be able to rest the hand is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 fully adjustable what is very 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.180
 good and good we have we have 20 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.220
 fully programmable keys here 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.110
 the back we can dry that good 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.480
 we have a keyboard like I told you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 fully programmable mechanic and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.540
 apart it is backlit and good 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.829
 we have this option which is going to 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.420
 allow to make a switch between 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.550
 different types of configurations 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.050
 now be playing how good is the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 switch is immediate there we have here 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.739
 this little pair of eight directions the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 which is also good is mechanical and the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.229
 truth is that it works very well we are going to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.610
 see a little until the pressures that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.660
 come this part of here that as 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.310
 they can appreciate they have keys or 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.619
 totally mechanical with a force 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.800
 activation of 50 grams it seems to me that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 are ready to be without apps 2.0 20 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.460
 fully programmable keys the remote 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.040
 of thumb with 8 programmable directions 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.580
 what is the module resting thumb rests 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.790
 hands and resting 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.890
 It is adjustable for maximum comfort 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.540
 has an immediate change of between 8 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.950
 key maps what I was telling you about 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.690
 this function here and good has 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.700
 unlimited game profiles and a 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 Backlit keyboard for control 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.180
 total even in the dark good 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.680
 let's proceed at this time to not 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.230
 hat this video how good we will do it 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.360
 this part of here the top of 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.780
 a little tape we're just going to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 try 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.510
 to open it 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.160
 to see what includes us in the part 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.830
 inside equal where they make some 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.170
 tests to verify the operation 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.640
 and how useful it can be in the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 kind of peace for you at the time of 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.940
 play and see how you can measure this 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.630
 empathy very similar to what the mouse is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.840
 that we reviewed recently and we took the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.350
 cable and here at the bottom it has 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.110
 what are small papers that I suppose 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.610
 What are the manual guarantees? 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.170
 stickers and others that we saw in the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.120
 previous product and good as they can 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 seen in this part we have what 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.220
 the pad is completely unpacked 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.890
 which is a hug of quite 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.270
 Robust keys work 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.170
 excellently well we are not doing the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.810
 tests so that you can 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.570
 verify this equal a usb cable this 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.430
 very long with the terminal bathed in gold 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.500
 for better connectivity in the part of 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.730
 team where a small button which 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.220
 allows us to adjust what is the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 position of this one rests wrists and as 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.540
 I told you we can see here what it is 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.940
 the button the pack with eight positions 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.959
 another space key seems to me and 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.590
 here we have what are the options 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.390
 to 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.830
 changing keys the truth is a 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.140
 computer that presents robot feels 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.420
 very well very well done this time it 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.860
 The truth is very true and well, let's go 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.260
 to leave here this part of a box 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.640
 and we noticed a little review so that 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.709
 you can see how it works 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.810
 when they are playing with him and check 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.110
 see if it's useful for you or you 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.110
 We perform 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.500
 do not 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.090
 and we will see at this moment they are seeing 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:29.240
 on screen what is the proof of this 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.620
 pack playing league of legends that good 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.300
 They are automatically coming 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.699
 already configured the keys was not of 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.800
 third parties in a special configuration and 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.249
 well configured and all the keys 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.270
 for what is this game 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.009
 something important I have to say is that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.930
 today during only the day 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.449

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.490

 hashtag razer store mexico are going to see it 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.789

 incorporate luck on screen so that 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.189
 they qualify it and today in the 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.509
 night it seems to me to announce what is the 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.520
 winner of a product of the brand 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.560
