do is zoom the crap out of them it's as

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.450 
do is zoom the crap out of them it's as
simple<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.079> okay<00:00:58.079> fine<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.129> guess<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
simple as that okay fine I guess you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
simple as that okay fine I guess you
might<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.760> wondering<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.270> souping<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.079> well

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
might be wondering what souping is well

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
might be wondering what souping is well
unfortunately<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:03.149> has<00:01:03.300> nothing<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.960> with

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
unfortunately it has nothing to do with

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.940 
unfortunately it has nothing to do with
soup<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.710> hula<00:01:05.460> hoops<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:06.030> poop<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.409> instead

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
soup or hula hoops or poop but instead

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
soup or hula hoops or poop but instead
it's<00:01:08.220> basically<00:01:08.700> clearing<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> those

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's basically clearing one of those

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
it's basically clearing one of those
blocks<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.590> triangle<00:01:11.070> has<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
blocks when your triangle has the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.330 
blocks when your triangle has the
matching<00:01:11.700> color

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.640 

and<00:01:18.340> if<00:01:19.330> there's<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.600> few<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.140> same<00:01:20.350> color

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
and if there's a few of the same color

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.710 
and if there's a few of the same color
lined<00:01:21.010> up<00:01:21.160> in<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.370> row<00:01:21.400> you'll<00:01:21.880> zoom<00:01:21.910> em<00:01:22.390> all<00:01:22.570> at

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
lined up in a row you'll zoom em all at

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.080 
lined up in a row you'll zoom em all at
once<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.260> then<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.040> change<00:01:24.340> your<00:01:24.580> triangles

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
once and then to change your triangles

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.000 
once and then to change your triangles
color<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.690> can<00:01:25.840> swap<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.200> with<00:01:26.410> any<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
color you can swap it with any of the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.930 
color you can swap it with any of the
other<00:01:27.220> pieces

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
other pieces

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.030 
other pieces
so<00:01:28.420> after<00:01:28.840> you've<00:01:28.990> souped<00:01:29.350> enough<00:01:29.710> stuff

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
so after you've souped enough stuff

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.740 
so after you've souped enough stuff
you'll<00:01:30.340> move<00:01:30.550> on<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.850> higher<00:01:31.000> levels<00:01:31.479> with

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
you'll move on to higher levels with

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.570 
you'll move on to higher levels with
increased<00:01:32.200> speed<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.560> difficulty<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.550> you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
increased speed and difficulty and you

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.030 
increased speed and difficulty and you
might<00:01:34.300> even<00:01:34.330> see<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.750> few<00:01:35.050> special<00:01:35.500> items<00:01:35.590> that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
might even see a few special items that

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.070 
might even see a few special items that
start<00:01:36.250> popping<00:01:36.729> up<00:01:36.820> like<00:01:37.300> lion<00:01:37.630> clearing

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
start popping up like lion clearing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.530 
start popping up like lion clearing
bombs<00:01:38.350> stuff<00:01:38.950> like<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.270> game<00:01:40.420> will

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
bombs stuff like that so the game will

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.390 
bombs stuff like that so the game will
end<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:41.080> one<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.500> shapes<00:01:41.740> enters<00:01:42.250> your

obtain even higher scores by lining up

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.130 
obtain even higher scores by lining up
in<00:02:02.979> clearing<00:02:03.490> multiple<00:02:03.910> shapes<00:02:04.149> at<00:02:04.390> once<00:02:04.570> so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
in clearing multiple shapes at once so

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.380 
in clearing multiple shapes at once so
it<00:02:05.229> becomes<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.649> fairly<00:02:05.920> addictive<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.820> reflex

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
it becomes a fairly addictive and reflex

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.490 
it becomes a fairly addictive and reflex
intensive<00:02:08.050> puzzler

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.680 

the<00:02:14.280> art<00:02:14.460> style<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:15.030> also<00:02:15.270> pretty<00:02:15.600> interesting

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the art style is also pretty interesting

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.320 
the art style is also pretty interesting
