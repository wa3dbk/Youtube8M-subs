 Anger 6000 kilometers in operation at Home with her 35 hp 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.669

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:22.089
 Have decades and 2 of this rude wave is that and it's wave buffet too 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.529
 60% millimeter stroke 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.419
 yes, as you can see here recording new debt for Crescent Cry and also 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.120
 The bonus is absolutely fine here as well, sometimes saying Dürener is almost 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.560
 the new condition there is nothing to elicit as canceled or otherwise what 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 what did I do about the charge 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.330
 very easily 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.860
 in part, possibly even in almost all percent of Patron x 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.880
 The colossus Kauder is «Recording here at the Culture the Crankshaft too 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.160
 tight up here and although good 6 7 millimeters the vents one with the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.430
 Flashlight ranks maybe you can see that it rusted so easily 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.460
 granted 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.930
 I've got a good one and a half millimeter of work up there 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.580
 If you do not do that, Weimann puts a strain on the attractive Pohl Rades on the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.970
 injured as a percentage 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.740
 yes the entire load may only be on this upper area instead 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.110
 m total of the total exception 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.580
 more and as said after these workers around 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.620
 You could also see that quite well fit the fan 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.200
 wonderful on it 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.970
 and then I'm clear Peter Lischke 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.950
 because good three quarters of an hour 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.110
 to crawl in with ultimate goal did fit a lot of water with such movement though 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.360
 ground into the crankshaft 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.270
 then have the percent cleaned everything then was so synonymous 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.440
 expanded to it strangely 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.289
