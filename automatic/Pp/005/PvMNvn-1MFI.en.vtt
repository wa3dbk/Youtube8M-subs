just holding up like gangbusters so
extremely<00:00:58.500> absorptive<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> course<00:00:59.489> they

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
extremely absorptive of course they

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.130 
extremely absorptive of course they
really<00:01:00.210> work<00:01:00.390> great<00:01:01.350> acoustically<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.730> also

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140

what I like about these things in terms

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
what I like about these things in terms
of<00:01:23.640> their<00:01:23.790> size<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.479> they're<00:01:24.689> big<00:01:24.810> enough

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
of their size is that they're big enough

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
of their size is that they're big enough
to<00:01:25.080> cover<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> square<00:01:26.159> footage<00:01:26.369> 36

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to cover a lot of square footage 36

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.310 
to cover a lot of square footage 36
square<00:01:27.240> feet<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.600> four<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> half<00:01:27.930> by<00:01:28.140> eight

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
square feet is four and a half by eight
feet<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.280> they're<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.030> big<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

have these things pretty much encasing
my<00:01:37.590> drum<00:01:37.860> set<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.369> doing<00:01:38.610> recording<00:01:39.030> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
my drum set when I'm doing recording for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.149 
my drum set when I'm doing recording for
my<00:01:39.270> students<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.409> absorption<00:01:40.740> above

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
my students so I have absorption above

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
my students so I have absorption above
I'll<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:41.909> around<00:01:42.240> me<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> I've

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I'll have it all around me and I've

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'll have it all around me and I've
never<00:01:43.649> noticed<00:01:44.040> any<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.460> an<00:01:44.579> odor<00:01:44.729> that's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
never noticed any kind of an odor that's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
never noticed any kind of an odor that's
really<00:01:45.450> helpful<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.829> of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
really helpful because here that kind of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
really helpful because here that kind of
close<00:01:47.100> quarters<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.670> don't<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
close quarters you don't want to be you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530 
close quarters you don't want to be you
know<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.950> deal<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.540> they're

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
know have that to deal with they're

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.719 
know have that to deal with they're
they're<00:01:51.960> versatile<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.680> terms<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.189> actually

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
they're versatile in terms of actually

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370 
they're versatile in terms of actually
use<00:01:53.909> these<00:01:54.060> things<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.390> gobos<00:01:54.930> where<00:01:55.200> will

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
use these things for gobos where will

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
use these things for gobos where will
will<00:01:55.860> actually<00:01:55.950> drape<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:56.610> over<00:01:56.700> something

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
will actually drape them over something

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.420 
will actually drape them over something
maybe<00:01:57.630> double<00:01:57.960> them<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.590> few<00:01:59.070> feet<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.310> front

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
maybe double them up a few feet in front

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
maybe double them up a few feet in front
of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> guitar<00:01:59.880> amp<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> keyboard<00:02:00.780> amp<00:02:01.229> just

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
of a guitar amp or a keyboard amp just

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.940 
of a guitar amp or a keyboard amp just
to<00:02:01.530> pull<00:02:02.040> down<00:02:02.189> some<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.990> intensity<00:02:03.990> I've

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to pull down some of that intensity I've

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
to pull down some of that intensity I've
even<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.369> people<00:02:05.430> use<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.210> bass<00:02:06.450> traps

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
even had people use these as bass traps

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.550 
even had people use these as bass traps
a<00:02:06.990> few<00:02:07.170> times

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a few times

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
a few times
just<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.799> temporary<00:02:08.220> fix<00:02:09.060> where<00:02:09.270> they'll<00:02:09.450> fold

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
just a temporary fix where they'll fold

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
just a temporary fix where they'll fold
these<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:09.899> multiple<00:02:10.530> times<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.039> kind<00:02:11.340> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
these up multiple times and just kind of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.160 
these up multiple times and just kind of
stuff<00:02:11.640> them<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.209> corner<00:02:12.450> they've<00:02:12.989> been

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
stuff them in a corner they've been

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.020 
stuff them in a corner they've been
really<00:02:13.349> effective<00:02:13.650> because<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> absorption

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
really effective because the absorption

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.720 
really effective because the absorption
material<00:02:15.360> works<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.020> well<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.260> these<00:02:16.730> so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
material works so well for these so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.949 
material works so well for these so
there's<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.840> lot<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.260> great<00:02:20.959> advantages

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
there's just a lot of great advantages

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.410 
there's just a lot of great advantages
to<00:02:22.020> these<00:02:22.290> things<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.910> said<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.120> can't
