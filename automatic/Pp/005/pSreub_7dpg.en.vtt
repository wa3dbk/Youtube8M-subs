00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
things we really focused on when we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
things we really focused on when we
designed<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> console<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.430> making

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
designed this console is making

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.299 
designed this console is making
everything<00:00:54.210> faster<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.199> let's<00:00:55.770> imagine<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.190> was

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
everything faster so let's imagine I was

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.590 
everything faster so let's imagine I was
playing<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.699> game<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> were<00:00:57.270> talking

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
playing that game that you were talking

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
playing that game that you were talking
about<00:00:57.660> downloading<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:59.010> come<00:00:59.190> back<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
about downloading and I come back the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
about downloading and I come back the
next<00:00:59.489> day<00:00:59.730> you're<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.840> able<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> get

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
next day you're gonna be able to get

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
next day you're gonna be able to get
into<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.770> quickly<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.399> say<00:01:02.670> Xbox

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
into that really quickly so I say Xbox

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.539 
into that really quickly so I say Xbox
on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> system<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:03.960> turn<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.559> fast<00:01:04.860> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
on the system will turn on very fast so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
on the system will turn on very fast so
I<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.119> jump<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
I can just jump right back into that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
I can just jump right back into that
game<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> resumes<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.670> where<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.090> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
game and it resumes right where I was so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.969 
game and it resumes right where I was so
it's<00:01:10.110> really<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> change<00:01:10.680> how<00:01:10.920> people

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it's really going to change how people

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's really going to change how people
think<00:01:11.520> about<00:01:11.700> playing<00:01:12.060> games<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.439> makes

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
think about playing games now it makes

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
think about playing games now it makes
it<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:13.950> possible<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.549> drop<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.119> play<00:01:15.390> a

right there at your content actually
think<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> gets<00:01:55.979> even<00:01:56.280> cooler<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:56.729> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
think this gets even cooler when you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.789 
think this gets even cooler when you
have<00:01:56.909> multiple<00:01:57.149> people<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.079> room<00:01:58.259> too<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
have multiple people in the room too so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
have multiple people in the room too so
if<00:01:59.369> Emily<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> were<00:01:59.969> together<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.509> could

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
if Emily and I were together I could

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.440 
if Emily and I were together I could
have<00:02:00.840> xbox<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.530> show<00:02:01.829> me<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.130> home<00:02:02.310> screen<00:02:02.549> she

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
have xbox one show me my home screen she

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.179 
have xbox one show me my home screen she
could<00:02:03.630> tell<00:02:03.659> Xbox<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.649> switch<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.009> her

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
could tell Xbox one to switch to her

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
could tell Xbox one to switch to her
home<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:05.729> we'd<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.479> her<00:02:06.689> home<00:02:06.899> screen

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
home and then we'd see her home screen

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.380 
home and then we'd see her home screen
and<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.770> her<00:02:07.920> personalized<00:02:08.520> content

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
put it right there on the first level of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.490 
put it right there on the first level of
the<00:02:24.000> user<00:02:24.150> interface<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:25.110> example<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the user interface so for example you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.620 
the user interface so for example you
can<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.980> musicians<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.450> can

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
can have musicians that you like you can

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.350 
can have musicians that you like you can
have<00:02:27.870> TV<00:02:28.440> shows<00:02:28.740> or<00:02:29.070> movies<00:02:29.100> pinned<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.240> can

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
have TV shows or movies pinned you can

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.970 
have TV shows or movies pinned you can
have<00:02:30.480> your<00:02:30.600> favorite<00:02:30.810> games<00:02:31.140> pinned<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
have your favorite games pinned and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.460 
have your favorite games pinned and
websites<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.030> go<00:02:33.150> too<00:02:33.209> often<00:02:33.720> yeah<00:02:34.350> and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
websites that you go too often yeah and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.650 
websites that you go too often yeah and
I<00:02:34.530> think<00:02:34.590> bringing<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.430> into<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.239> world

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
I think bringing that into the world

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
I think bringing that into the world
where<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.050> have<00:02:37.230> multitasking<00:02:37.739> makes<00:02:38.220> this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
where we have multitasking makes this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.460 
where we have multitasking makes this
even<00:02:38.550> cooler<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:40.110> open<00:02:40.380> up

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
even cooler right like I can open up

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.650 
even cooler right like I can open up
Internet<00:02:40.920> Explorer<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.270> music

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
Internet Explorer and then have music

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.000 
Internet Explorer and then have music
sitting<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> side<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.650> playing<00:02:43.890> in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
sitting there on the side be playing in

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.110 
sitting there on the side be playing in
the<00:02:44.070> background<00:02:44.250> while<00:02:44.489> I'm<00:02:44.700> browsing<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the background while I'm browsing the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.729 
the background while I'm browsing the
web<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.570> then<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.230> switch<00:02:46.410> over<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
web and then I can switch over to

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.009 
web and then I can switch over to
