more than actual science but anyway if

the moon's been up there billions of
years<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.550> formed<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> Pacific

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
years and was formed from the Pacific

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
years and was formed from the Pacific
Ocean<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:43.829> formed<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> earth<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> form

like<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:46.160> was<00:00:47.160> told<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.670> school<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.360> where<00:00:48.600> are

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
like I was told in school then where are

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.700 
like I was told in school then where are
the<00:00:48.899> moon<00:00:49.079> meteorites<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.640> would<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the moon meteorites you would think that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.930 
the moon meteorites you would think that
the<00:00:52.710> earth<00:00:52.890> would<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.219> covered<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.760> moon

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the earth would be covered with moon

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
the earth would be covered with moon
meteorites<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.840> mainstream<00:00:55.110> science<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
meteorites but mainstream science is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.020 
meteorites but mainstream science is
only<00:00:56.309> found<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:57.289> 13.2<00:00:58.289> pounds<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.789> kilograms

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
only found of 13.2 pounds to kilograms

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.139 
only found of 13.2 pounds to kilograms
and<00:01:00.690> wound<00:01:00.870> meteorites<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> earth<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
and wound meteorites on the earth and

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.690 
and wound meteorites on the earth and
the<00:01:03.149> Mars<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> same<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.589> Mars<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.280> Mars

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the Mars about the same as Mars now Mars

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.539 
the Mars about the same as Mars now Mars
is<00:01:05.939> much<00:01:06.240> further<00:01:06.570> away<00:01:06.780> from<00:01:07.080> Earth<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
is much further away from Earth and the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
is much further away from Earth and the
moon<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.689> atmosphere<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
moon and it's got an atmosphere and a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.660 
moon and it's got an atmosphere and a
stronger<00:01:10.950> gravity<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.760> why<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
stronger gravity so why the is there the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
stronger gravity so why the is there the
same<00:01:14.880> amount<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> Mars<00:01:15.840> meteorites<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.680> earth

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
same amount of Mars meteorites on earth

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
same amount of Mars meteorites on earth
as<00:01:17.159> moon<00:01:17.400> meteorite<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
as moon meteorite you would think that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.410 
as moon meteorite you would think that
there<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.670> great<00:01:20.670> deal<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
there would be a great deal more you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
there would be a great deal more you
should<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.750> able<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> desert

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
should be able to go out on the desert

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
should be able to go out on the desert
there<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> pick<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.720> meteorites<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
there and pick up little meteorites and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
there and pick up little meteorites and
build<00:01:25.470> houses<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.310> them<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.580> there's<00:01:26.820> no

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
build houses out of them but there's no

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.539 
build houses out of them but there's no
moon<00:01:27.270> meteorites<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.049> earth<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.220> what's<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
moon meteorites on earth so what's the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
moon meteorites on earth so what's the
deal<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.659> searched<00:01:31.020> all

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.690 
and check out my hmm actual hydrographic
information<00:06:09.210> of<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.480> Arctic<00:06:09.780> Ocean<00:06:09.960> there

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
information of the Arctic Ocean there

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.780 
information of the Arctic Ocean there
you'll<00:06:11.700> see<00:06:12.090> that<00:06:12.360> there's<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.110> large<00:06:13.410> hole<00:06:14.400> in

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
you'll see that there's a large hole in

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.870 
you'll see that there's a large hole in
the<00:06:15.060> top<00:06:15.300> of<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.630> globe<00:06:17.120> hmm<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.480> I<00:06:18.810> use<00:06:19.050> them

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
the top of the globe hmm and I use them

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.800 
the top of the globe hmm and I use them
something<00:06:20.880> that<00:06:21.030> looks<00:06:21.390> like<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.840> moon<00:06:22.080> there

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
something that looks like the moon there

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.680 
something that looks like the moon there
and<00:06:25.790> ricocheted<00:06:26.790> off<00:06:26.820> the<00:06:27.030> earth<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.540> went

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
and ricocheted off the earth and went

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.720 
and ricocheted off the earth and went
into<00:06:27.840> orbit<00:06:28.110> eleven<00:06:28.710> thousand<00:06:29.280> seven<00:06:29.610> hundred

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
into orbit eleven thousand seven hundred

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.060 
into orbit eleven thousand seven hundred
and<00:06:30.000> twelve<00:06:30.270> years<00:06:30.390> ago<00:06:30.690> I<00:06:31.140> know<00:06:31.740> this<00:06:31.920> is

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
and twelve years ago I know this is

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.460 
and twelve years ago I know this is
really<00:06:32.310> hard<00:06:32.670> for<00:06:32.760> people<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:33.210> accept<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:34.350> I

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
really hard for people to accept and I

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.380 
really hard for people to accept and I
couldn't<00:06:34.770> accept<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.190> myself<00:06:35.430> but<00:06:36.000> after<00:06:36.360> I

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
couldn't accept it myself but after I

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.399 
couldn't accept it myself but after I
did<00:06:36.510> the<00:06:36.870> research<00:06:37.050> and<00:06:37.590> really

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
did the research and really

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.529 
did the research and really
did<00:06:39.099> the<00:06:39.249> studying<00:06:39.699> on<00:06:39.849> it<00:06:39.999> put<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:40.210> math

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
did the studying on it put the math

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.510 
did the studying on it put the math
together<00:06:40.809> I<00:06:41.349> had<00:06:41.559> a<00:06:41.589> lot<00:06:41.740> of<00:06:41.770> help<00:06:42.009> doing<00:06:42.249> this

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
could have happened to double arable

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.309 
could have happened to double arable
land<00:06:51.759> on<00:06:51.969> the<00:06:52.119> earth<00:06:52.479> and<00:06:52.869> double<00:06:53.199> the
