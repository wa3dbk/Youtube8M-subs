00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.990 

so<00:00:21.740> we'll<00:00:21.859> show<00:00:22.039> you<00:00:22.070> how<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.430> image<00:00:22.850> the

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
so we'll show you how to image the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.160 
so we'll show you how to image the
tricuspid<00:00:23.420> valve

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
tricuspid valve

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.990 
tricuspid valve
there<00:00:24.560> are<00:00:24.650> several<00:00:24.890> views<00:00:25.250> where<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:25.789> can

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
there are several views where you can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.249 
there are several views where you can
get<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.420> good<00:00:26.900> image<00:00:27.230> quality<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:29.720> first<00:00:29.990> view

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
get a good image quality the first view

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.060 
get a good image quality the first view
is<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.160> parasternal<00:00:32.050> long<00:00:33.050> axis<00:00:33.620> view<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:33.980> the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
is the parasternal long axis view of the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.830 
is the parasternal long axis view of the
right<00:00:34.250> ventricle<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:34.970> this<00:00:35.120> is<00:00:35.270> not<00:00:35.449> the<00:00:35.660> view

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
right ventricle so this is not the view

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.960 
right ventricle so this is not the view
that<00:00:35.960> I'm<00:00:36.110> showing<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.470> right<00:00:36.559> now<00:00:36.980> but<00:00:37.820> it's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
that I'm showing you right now but it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.450 
that I'm showing you right now but it's
a<00:00:38.120> view<00:00:38.390> where<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:39.080> tilt<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.620> transducer

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
a view where you tilt the transducer

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.360 
a view where you tilt the transducer
downwards<00:00:41.030> from<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.900> view<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.410> then<00:00:43.190> all<00:00:43.339> of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
downwards from this view and then all of

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.799 
downwards from this view and then all of
a<00:00:43.519> sudden<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:43.850> will<00:00:43.940> get<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.360> tricuspid

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
a sudden you will get the tricuspid

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.820 
a sudden you will get the tricuspid
valve<00:00:45.339> so<00:00:46.339> this<00:00:46.519> is<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:48.110> right<00:00:48.320> ventricle

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
valve so this is the right ventricle

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.829 
valve so this is the right ventricle
here<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:50.510> is<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.750> right<00:00:50.900> atrium<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.839> this

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
here this is the right atrium and this

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.530 
here this is the right atrium and this
is<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.080> tricuspid<00:00:54.500> valve<00:00:55.119> this<00:00:56.119> would<00:00:56.299> be<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
is the tricuspid valve this would be the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.689 
is the tricuspid valve this would be the
anterior<00:00:57.170> leaflet<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.799> this<00:00:57.979> is<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.250> septal

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
anterior leaflet and this is the septal

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.539 
anterior leaflet and this is the septal
leaflet<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:01.659> from<00:01:02.659> this<00:01:02.809> view<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.140> is<00:01:03.260> often

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
leaflet and from this view it is often

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.880 
leaflet and from this view it is often
possible<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.820> even<00:01:05.089> quantify<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:06.140> maximal<00:01:06.590> tr

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
possible to even quantify the maximal tr

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.170 
possible to even quantify the maximal tr
velocity<00:01:07.460> especially<00:01:07.909> if<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.060> have

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
velocity especially if you have

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.590 
velocity especially if you have
eccentric<00:01:08.540> TR<00:01:09.020> Jets<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.820> second<00:01:11.210> view<00:01:11.330> which

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
eccentric TR Jets the second view which

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.270 
eccentric TR Jets the second view which
is<00:01:11.780> also<00:01:12.850> good<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:15.049> use<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.920> Paris

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
is also good to use is the Paris

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.969 
is also good to use is the Paris

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
have the tricuspid valve and and this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.760 
have the tricuspid valve and and this
view<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:24.980> often<00:01:25.280> very<00:01:26.110> nice<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.350> see<00:01:27.560> the

view it is often very nice to see the
sub<00:01:28.010> valvular<00:01:28.420> apparatus<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.660> see<00:01:29.840> here<00:01:30.400> this

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
sub valvular apparatus you see here this

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.100 
sub valvular apparatus you see here this
would<00:01:31.610> be<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:31.850> sub<00:01:32.060> valve<00:01:32.270> apparatus<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.050> the

much better deal in iation of a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.630 
much better deal in iation of a
tricuspid<00:01:56.840> valve<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.530> way<00:01:57.710> try<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.430> also

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
tricuspid valve that way try to also

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.600 
tricuspid valve that way try to also
bring<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.659> transducer<00:02:00.380> as<00:02:00.770> far<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.370> can

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
bring the transducer as far as you can

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.300 
bring the transducer as far as you can
in<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.150> middle<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.750> sector<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.350> then<00:02:04.190> you

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
in the middle of the sector and then you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.130 
in the middle of the sector and then you
have<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.700> ante<00:02:05.150> relief<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.780> septal

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
have the ante relief of the septal

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.440 
have the ante relief of the septal
leaflet<00:02:06.530> here<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.880> would<00:02:08.090> be<00:02:08.239> either

you cannot tell simply because it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.820 
you cannot tell simply because it
