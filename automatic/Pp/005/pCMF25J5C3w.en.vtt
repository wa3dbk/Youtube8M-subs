00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hey welcome as we are I am many 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.830
 here as always and today I bring you one 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.469
 Small story is short but at the same 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.150
 time considered that very intense and has 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 a message is beautiful you will love it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 I assure you see me I was 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.180
 playing on a lovely day of course 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.490
 on channels not to use all together 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 all by teams this shit is that already 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 we've seen it a million times for 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.170
 course but you see he was playing 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.930
 with the support class effectively 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.060
 I was trying to get clips for the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.640
 analysis of weapons of the kind of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 I support them let's say light machine guns 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.450
 so I was trying to play with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.710
 those weapons in particular to get me the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.200
 clips that is something that you have asked me 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 Pretty cool fucking bitch all and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.700
 then this happens which is a scene 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 pretty typical on do not use channels 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 effectively as a sniper I 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 Kills from the crane 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 it's something we've seen a million 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 times and it's not uncommon who we 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 we go with one of these types of and good 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.590
 nothing happens either , nothing has nothing 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.210
 yes decided not to change my style of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 game because I was taking out clips and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 in fact he started firing the crane 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.489
 but it turns out that there are two there are two 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 good snipers 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's see is a little more unnerving not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.939
 we are going to deny it, touch a little more 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.830
 fuck that there are two guys really 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.049
 up but good eh look besides they were 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.090
 bad did not get shipped quickly and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.039
 nothing is happening either we will continue when 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.390
 with the support weapons that are with the 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.570
 that I'm going to bring you the clips 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.789
 after all truth and in the end more 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240
 forward to time they kill me is not 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.180
 I reappear and well happens this happens 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.490
 this happens 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.960
 is that there are things that we are going to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.270
 put the slow motion let's put the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.400
 camera is free is very large and the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.830
 slow motion to see it is great 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.060
 well then congratulations to both of 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 the tower has not seen all the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.160
 balls, you already have me 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.720
 fucked and decided to change from here and 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.700
 change play style despite 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.220
 I did not want to because I wanted to get rid of 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.320
 fucking clips for the weapons of the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.630
 support house so good decided 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.979
 catch a sniper I take my time 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.979
 I see the opportunity 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.160
 whenever you want 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.599
 and the truth is that I'm happy 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.290
 I'm happy I'm not going to deny it 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.739
 So here is a moral here 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.250
 a lesson that I consider that there is 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.489
 learn in elections from my 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.930
 point of view the elections can 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.870
 play a little bit the balls from time to time 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.430
 when from time to time it rubs against 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.680
 other people's eggs even though 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.590
 it bothered a little look nothing happens but 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.870
 too touched of eggs you know when 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.540
 already several hands are touching the eggs and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.790
 sometimes there are pinches and punches there is 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.000
 when not there is when you're passing 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.439
 and you were looking for problems and in short 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 that address for today dear ones 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.120

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.220
