it's<00:04:44.610> what<00:04:44.760> kind<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.000> average<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.720> do<00:04:46.080> you

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
it's what kind of average you do you

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.450 
it's what kind of average you do you
want<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.500> reach

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.790 

but<00:04:53.000> there<00:04:53.180> were<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.480> many<00:04:53.660> there<00:04:54.140> are<00:04:54.230> so<00:04:54.440> few

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
but there were so many there are so few

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.700 
but there were so many there are so few
tournaments<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:56.240> that's<00:04:56.450> it's<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:57.020> pity<00:04:57.200> only

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
tournaments and that's it's a pity only

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.990 
tournaments and that's it's a pity only
three<00:04:57.920> cushon<00:04:58.280> there<00:04:58.490> were<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.760> lot<00:04:58.970> of

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000
