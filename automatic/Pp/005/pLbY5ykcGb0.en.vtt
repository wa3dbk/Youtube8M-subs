00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 today I'm going to teach what might be a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.350
 smaller engine and simpler one of the engine 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.000
 or popular 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.269
 I already made a video that uses the same 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.549
 here is the video 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.279
 here below and this is a version that is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 different and perhaps simpler it is still 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.449
 accurate will need a stack a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.039
 common stack will need a higher 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.560
 that has more or less the same format 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.029
 Cell I will use three here is 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 but you can buy it by 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.099
 internet is not very expensive and will need 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 of a thread a film of these that pass 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.700
 inside the wall you buy in 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.489
 any building material store 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 if you are going to use a tiny piece and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.230
 maybe a duct tape 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.940
 to start you will have to cut 15 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 centimeters of this blue cable here and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:59.390
 then strip the car there you have to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 separate 5 threads from these fine serve 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 and roll up the shape only 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.409
 You get five more wire and you do. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.869
 plus a field joining 5 when you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.250
 finish you can cut the tip of the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.710
 wires to stay more uniform and now 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.299
 You'll have to put these two together. 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.950
 children in a very 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.890
 special and for this he presented a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.990
 paper prototype 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 pretend that this is the wires 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 this is the format that will have to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.950
 to do this here is the pile here is the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 positive pole of the pile and they 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.290
 here are mills 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.229
 so go 11 but the pile on top and you 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 will put it around here and if 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.630
 of the threads will lean against the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.670
 battery and this wheel underneath 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 go to the movies 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.439
 it is important that the wheel is larger 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.350
 which plants because they can not be 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.220
 all the time, leaning against it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.160
 result in bullshit 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.070
 Slack first I'll wind a wire in the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.290
 another about one centimeter 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.450
 this part has to look good clip 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 very cute not to escape 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.300
 Then with that done I'll give a space 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:35.850
 about one centimeter of each 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:37.830
 side and dobin now has to get 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.690
 the track with 11 but touch that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.840
 here on the positive side of the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.410
 stack calculate a fold down here 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.300
 exactly where it is located. 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:58.800
 in the middle of the magnets that will give more or 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:01.380
 except here and now, we have these 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.730
 two works here that will 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.340
 cinemas and we'll have to make a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.890
 here I am going to cut a 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.800
 little this is how I go 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.630
 find a little this here is so already 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.140
 It's almost the ball made only that I 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.790
 I have to come here with this tip in 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.530
 get a wink 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:29.120
 this side the same or any other 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.120
 point to get the tip of the other side 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.920
 [Music] 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.170
 has formed a ball which has a 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.660
 diameter a little larger than the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.660
 diameter of the upper 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.420
 if you were able to make the object of this 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.640
 here perfectly symmetrical the motor 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.489
 It is ready but as I can not 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.680
 do you will see that the motor goes almost 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.100
 and then we'll make a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.009
 Gambiarra line that helps a lot 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.009
 [Music] 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.130
 to prevent the motor from escaping 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.709
 I'm going to make a wall of protection here in 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.690
 back using duct tape 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.720
 so I'll wrap duct tape around 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.100
 and I'm going to wrap the tape sometimes 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.959
 because the other half of the tape will stay 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.800
 half out in a kind of 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.800
 wall that will hold the tip of the copper 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:46.480
 [Music] 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.560
 and if you can format 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.450
 different copper to put on top 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.120
 from the stack you can make a 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:15.129
 little engine a little bit different 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:17.930
 [Music] 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.189
 and how is the engine so simple? 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.240
 that's how it works 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.909
 the first thing we have to do is 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.699
 consider that this set of more 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.039
 here ends up being a continuation of the pole 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.020
 negative cell and the time the 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.969
 people place copper by linking pole 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.849
 positive to the negative pole is created one 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.940
 current and a magnetic field 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.360
 created by the magnet interacts with the electrons 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.289
 are passing there resulting in this 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.819
 movement 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.379
 And you can ask me but you deserve it. 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.389
 connecting positive pole to negative pole 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.150
 making a short circuit and going 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.490
 spoil pile're giving circuit course 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.699
 longer than the motor begins to turn 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.409
 copper is already taken off the magnet 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.520
 then back take off again around 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.939
 school again then you are giving 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.870
 short or short 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:07.580
 how much short circuits 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.830
 they are not enough for you 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.229
 discharge the battery at one time 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.139
 the engine will still spin for quite a while 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:20.469
 time but it starts here you find 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.469
 next Tuesday in the blog ru 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:34.100
 and ah ah ah ah a geron 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.100
