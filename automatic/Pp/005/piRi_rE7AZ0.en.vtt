00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.710
 or tell carlota such that 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.060
 what are the new models of the web 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.990
 family biota this season though 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.790
 several more 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.189
 these are for example one of the models 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.400
 more at the moment they are more successful than 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.599
 all that is the rhythm is gorgeous 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.599
 very Cantabrian 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.930
 move as very practical because even 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.420
 in the city I think that this time 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 designers have wanted a little bit not the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.860
 you are watching but have wanted to do 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.020
 designs where they are very wearable in 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.610
 the city you can not put back in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.920
 all the places but not that that wants 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.720
 to say that he has always had but that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.210
 can carry in different hours in what 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.150
 that we can of course then then 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.100
 go these are the ones also is a 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.290
 bag is much smaller that does not weigh 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.240
 it's a lot that's very easy when you have 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.240
 to travel when you go against 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.250
 Yes Yes Yes Yes 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.540
 it took me a short time to get down in euro 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.750
 they go and I also find it very nice 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.299
 It is very wearable If you doubt mental 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.180
 you see that it goes with the same ones to oranges 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.230
 you will be good I am the most putting 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.650
 name always 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.840
 very familiar muniain 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.550
 this is a bag more at night we have 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.550
 thought something that you can place more 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.470
 something easier faster here too 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.270
 you have another color if these boots 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.510
 contains one pass 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.420
 these two these boots but these boots 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.130
 they sold out not since they ran out they have 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.980
 done again and they are also 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.980
 exhausting so that my mother my mother 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.840
 in purses are very practical 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.350
 prima fills with an accordion inside 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.350
 the little coins 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.850
 also always with which you can carry 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.460
 and how is it possible that they run out so 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.710
 fast our products explain it to me 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.590
 for example what of the boots is 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.270
 which is an incredible phenomenon good in 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.320
 woman's footwear good tracing 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.140
 the bags 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.780
 the complement the woman loves 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.170
 mainly and separately because it is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.710
 a super wearable design although they have 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.560
 its point or curing Frontel bellows 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.120
 yes but I think it is very very adipose I 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.280
 I think it 's something so fast because 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.130
 they are are products that have are points 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.770
 of difference and that they put you style 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.990
 that differentiates you in many others and 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.320
 apart also that clear of the pieces 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.320
 They are unique
