electricity Scott you want to show us

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.530 
electricity Scott you want to show us
around<00:00:14.630> the<00:00:14.870> bike<00:00:15.050> yeah<00:00:15.620> sure<00:00:15.889> let's<00:00:16.160> go<00:00:16.280> in<00:00:16.340> a

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
around the bike yeah sure let's go in a

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.320 
around the bike yeah sure let's go in a
speedo<00:00:17.540> here<00:00:17.810> and<00:00:18.730> slightly<00:00:19.730> modified<00:00:20.090> and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
speedo here and slightly modified and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.700 
speedo here and slightly modified and
we've<00:00:20.420> got<00:00:20.600> an<00:00:20.689> air<00:00:20.810> meter<00:00:20.990> which<00:00:21.320> tells<00:00:21.560> us

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
we've got an air meter which tells us

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.170 
we've got an air meter which tells us
how<00:00:21.740> much<00:00:22.010> current<00:00:22.369> we're<00:00:22.490> drawing<00:00:22.670> as<00:00:23.000> we're

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
how much current we're drawing as we're

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.240 
how much current we're drawing as we're
cruising<00:00:23.900> along<00:00:24.020> if<00:00:24.770> we<00:00:24.919> have<00:00:25.040> in<00:00:25.160> the

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
cruising along if we have in the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.589 
cruising along if we have in the
throttle<00:00:25.460> that's<00:00:25.669> going<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:25.939> go<00:00:26.029> up<00:00:26.240> if<00:00:26.450> we

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
throttle that's going to go up if we

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.330 
throttle that's going to go up if we
back<00:00:26.779> off<00:00:26.930> it's<00:00:27.050> going<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.230> come<00:00:27.349> down<00:00:27.529> so

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
back off it's going to come down so

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.240 
back off it's going to come down so
basically<00:00:28.790> it<00:00:29.029> tells<00:00:29.360> us<00:00:29.509> you<00:00:30.410> know<00:00:30.529> if<00:00:30.829> we<00:00:31.070> try

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
basically it tells us you know if we try

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.409 
basically it tells us you know if we try
and<00:00:31.279> keep<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.640> answers<00:00:31.849> as<00:00:31.939> low<00:00:32.029> as<00:00:32.150> we<00:00:32.239> can

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
and keep the answers as low as we can

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.300 
and keep the answers as low as we can
doing<00:00:32.720> get<00:00:33.050> as<00:00:33.140> longer-range<00:00:33.680> as<00:00:33.890> possible

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310

motor and the amount that we require

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.320 
motor and the amount that we require
when<00:01:59.240> we<00:01:59.360> turn<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.810> throttle<00:02:00.800> up<00:02:01.040> here<00:02:01.220> as<00:02:02.210> you

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
when we turn the throttle up here as you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.000 
when we turn the throttle up here as you
turn<00:02:02.510> this<00:02:02.630> followed<00:02:02.930> you'll<00:02:03.110> hear<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.740> bit<00:02:03.920> of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
turn this followed you'll hear a bit of

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.860 
turn this followed you'll hear a bit of
a<00:02:04.070> whistle<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.520> little<00:02:05.000> bit<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.180> noise<00:02:05.360> at<00:02:05.690> least

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
a whistle a little bit of noise at least

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.330 
a whistle a little bit of noise at least
you<00:02:05.990> know<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.110> powers<00:02:06.500> coming<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.160> that

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
you know the powers coming on so that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.949 
you know the powers coming on so that
you<00:02:07.400> don't<00:02:07.580> know<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:08.119> don't<00:02:08.239> just<00:02:08.330> take<00:02:08.810> off

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
you don't know you don't just take off

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.619 
you don't know you don't just take off
without<00:02:09.110> any<00:02:09.500> kind<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.830> noise<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:11.150> charging

full fully charge takes about probably

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.690 
full fully charge takes about probably
takes<00:02:29.510> about<00:02:29.600> eight<00:02:30.410> hours<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.550> you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
takes about eight hours really but you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.780 
takes about eight hours really but you
can<00:02:31.820> get<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.150> get<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.500> 50%<00:02:33.500> charge<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.370> less

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
can get you can get a 50% charge in less

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.500 
can get you can get a 50% charge in less
probably<00:02:35.180> two<00:02:35.390> or<00:02:35.450> three<00:02:35.630> hours<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:38.120> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
probably two or three hours but it's to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.120 
probably two or three hours but it's to
fully<00:02:38.690> charge<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.140> which<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.530> because<00:02:39.800> it's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
fully charge it which is because it's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.410 
fully charge it which is because it's
good<00:02:40.340> for<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.520> battery's<00:02:40.819> life<00:02:40.970> into

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
good for the battery's life into

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
a pre charge to the motor controller so

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.910 
a pre charge to the motor controller so
that<00:03:28.280> when<00:03:28.430> if<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.090> were<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.270> turn<00:03:29.450> off<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
that when if you were to turn off the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.750 
that when if you were to turn off the
emergency<00:03:30.920> disconnect<00:03:31.100> switch<00:03:31.520> like<00:03:31.730> that

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
emergency disconnect switch like that

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.330 
emergency disconnect switch like that
when<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.750> turn<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.050> back<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.230> again<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:34.099> don't

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
when you turn it back on again you don't

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.070 
when you turn it back on again you don't
want<00:03:34.520> a<00:03:34.580> big<00:03:34.819> in<00:03:35.000> rush<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.330> current<00:03:35.690> going<00:03:35.840> into

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
want a big in rush of current going into

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.360 
want a big in rush of current going into
the<00:03:36.200> motor<00:03:36.380> controller<00:03:36.800> because<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.220> blow

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
the motor controller because it can blow

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.809 
the motor controller because it can blow
it<00:03:37.520> up

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
it up

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.720 
it up
eventually<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:39.050> these<00:03:39.230> these<00:03:39.680> are<00:03:39.950> large

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
eventually so these these are large

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.420 
eventually so these these are large
