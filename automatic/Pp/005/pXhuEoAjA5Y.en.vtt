that's<00:01:13.090> fine<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:13.450> my<00:01:13.540> ninja<00:01:13.720> monkey<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.170> I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
that's fine with my ninja monkey so I

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.480 
that's fine with my ninja monkey so I
guess<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:14.560> what<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.770> ninja<00:01:15.010> monkeys<00:01:15.340> will

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
guess that's what the ninja monkeys will

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.600 
guess that's what the ninja monkeys will
for<00:01:15.970> them<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:17.320> special<00:01:17.560> agents<00:01:18.100> do<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:18.460> guess

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
for them what special agents do I guess

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.499 
for them what special agents do I guess
that's<00:01:18.760> my<00:01:18.880> in-game<00:01:19.030> money<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:20.530> use<00:01:20.830> for

camo<00:03:30.180> types<00:03:30.540> i<00:03:30.660> guess<00:03:30.840> got<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.290> he<00:03:31.380> can

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
camo types i guess got that he can

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.620 
camo types i guess got that he can
register<00:03:31.709> though<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.370> that's<00:03:32.549> wow<00:03:34.580> ok<00:03:35.630> that

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
register though so that's wow ok that

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.710 
register though so that's wow ok that
was<00:03:36.750> easy<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.670> he<00:03:38.790> doesn't<00:03:38.880> gain<00:03:39.180> experience

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
was easy so he doesn't gain experience

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.819 
was easy so he doesn't gain experience
points<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.140> looks<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.320> unless<00:03:40.709> you

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
points and it looks like unless you

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.530 
points and it looks like unless you
actually<00:03:41.010> buy<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> upgrade<00:03:42.000> which<00:03:42.209> kind<00:03:42.450> of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
actually buy the upgrade which kind of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.930 
actually buy the upgrade which kind of
is<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> fail<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.280> don't<00:03:44.280> really<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.820> all

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
is a fail I don't really like that all

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.160 
is a fail I don't really like that all
that<00:03:45.060> well<00:03:45.209> maybe<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:45.510> only<00:03:45.660> upgrading<00:03:46.049> one

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that well maybe it's only upgrading one

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.460 
that well maybe it's only upgrading one
at<00:03:46.290> once<00:03:46.440> will<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.799> able<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.950> tell<00:03:47.130> after<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.070 

so<00:03:54.470> glue<00:03:54.770> monkeys<00:03:55.190> are<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.780> yes<00:03:56.959> I

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
so glue monkeys are in this so yes I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.660 
so glue monkeys are in this so yes I
guess<00:03:57.200> it's<00:03:57.349> only<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.620> one<00:03:57.650> upgrade<00:03:58.069> at<00:03:58.400> once

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
guess it's only on one upgrade at once

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.370 
guess it's only on one upgrade at once
then<00:03:58.940> okay<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.420> it's<00:03:59.690> only<00:03:59.750> one<00:03:59.989> upgrade<00:04:00.140> at

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
then okay so it's only one upgrade at

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.839 
then okay so it's only one upgrade at
once<00:04:00.560> they<00:04:00.800> change<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.160> lot<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.400> shit<00:04:01.610> in<00:04:01.640> this

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
once they change a lot of shit in this

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.809 
once they change a lot of shit in this
man<00:04:02.620> blue<00:04:03.620> monkeys<00:04:03.980> are<00:04:04.190> basically<00:04:04.520> slowed

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
man blue monkeys are basically slowed

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.760 
man blue monkeys are basically slowed
down<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.630> like<00:04:05.840> those<00:04:06.020> two<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.590> holy

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
down and I like those two and a holy

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.790 
down and I like those two and a holy
fuck<00:04:07.310> at<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.640> range<00:04:08.440> I'm<00:04:09.440> going<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.620> put

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
fuck at that range I'm going to put

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.500 
fuck at that range I'm going to put
these<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.950> little<00:04:10.130> bit<00:04:10.370> lower<00:04:10.700> here<00:04:10.819> because<00:04:11.480> I

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
these a little bit lower here because I

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.150 
these a little bit lower here because I
think<00:04:11.810> glue<00:04:12.230> actually<00:04:12.349> interferes<00:04:12.950> with

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
think glue actually interferes with

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.150 
think glue actually interferes with
freezing<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:14.300> I'm<00:04:14.390> going<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.630> put<00:04:14.720> them<00:04:15.160> yeah

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
freezing so I'm going to put them yeah

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.530 
freezing so I'm going to put them yeah
it<00:04:16.280> should<00:04:16.459> be<00:04:16.489> good<00:04:16.669> right<00:04:16.880> there<00:04:17.120> because

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
it should be good right there because

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.759 
it should be good right there because
he's<00:04:17.690> not<00:04:17.840> going<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:17.989> be<00:04:18.079> needed<00:04:18.380> too<00:04:18.470> much<00:04:18.500> at

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
he's not going to be needed too much at

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.620
