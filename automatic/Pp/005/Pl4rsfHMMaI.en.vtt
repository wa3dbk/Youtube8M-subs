these<00:00:25.660> new<00:00:25.960> engines<00:00:26.520> are<00:00:27.520> still<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.970> two<00:00:28.450> liter

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
these new engines are still a two liter

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.420 
these new engines are still a two liter
displacement<00:00:28.810> limit<00:00:29.500> which<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:29.830> class<00:00:30.100> rules

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
displacement limit which is class rules

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.850 
displacement limit which is class rules
in<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.880> 45<00:00:31.300> millimeter<00:00:31.750> restrictor<00:00:32.230> these

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
in the 45 millimeter restrictor these

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.730 
in the 45 millimeter restrictor these
are<00:00:33.010> making<00:00:33.310> closer<00:00:33.490> to<00:00:33.700> 580

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
are making closer to 580

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.480 
are making closer to 580
Oh

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.410 

in<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.780> way<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.890> overcome<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.670> inherent<00:00:42.060> lag<00:00:42.240> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in a way to overcome the inherent lag in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
in a way to overcome the inherent lag in
the<00:00:42.450> turbocharger<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.880> lift

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the turbocharger so that when they lift

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
the turbocharger so that when they lift
out<00:00:45.240> of<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.420> throttle<00:00:45.630> to<00:00:45.990> you<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> break<00:00:46.470> into

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
out of the throttle to you to break into

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.530 
out of the throttle to you to break into
a<00:00:46.800> corner<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:47.400> just<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.090> slightly<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
a corner or just back off slightly to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.140 
a corner or just back off slightly to
change<00:00:49.230> line<00:00:49.560> when<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.580> come<00:00:50.610> back<00:00:50.790> on<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
change line when they come back on the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.090 
change line when they come back on the
power<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.660> need<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.960> instant<00:00:52.410> power<00:00:52.560> so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
power we need that instant power so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
power we need that instant power so
another<00:00:53.490> new<00:00:53.700> thing<00:00:53.730> we've<00:00:54.060> done<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.530> what

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
another new thing we've done is what

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.140 
another new thing we've done is what
added<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.950> called<00:00:56.220> their<00:00:56.370> response<00:00:56.820> valve

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
added was called their response valve

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.590 
added was called their response valve
and<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.200> response<00:00:58.590> valve<00:00:58.890> takes<00:00:59.310> air<00:00:59.700> that's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and the response valve takes air that's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
and the response valve takes air that's
charged<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> turbocharger<00:01:02.280> bypasses

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
charged from the turbocharger bypasses

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.430 
charged from the turbocharger bypasses
the<00:01:03.150> throttle<00:01:03.600> body<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.990> you're<00:01:04.110> off<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
the throttle body when you're off the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160 
the throttle body when you're off the
throttle<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:05.790> goes<00:01:06.000> back<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.690> valve<00:01:06.960> on

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
throttle it goes back to this valve on

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.170 
throttle it goes back to this valve on
the<00:01:07.200> bulkhead<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.190> stand<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> controlled

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the bulkhead which stand is controlled

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.830 
the bulkhead which stand is controlled
by<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> ECU<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.610> engine<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.090> sends<00:01:12.660> air

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
by the ECU for the engine and sends air

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
by the ECU for the engine and sends air
back<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.470> lower<00:01:13.650> hoses<00:01:14.070> back<00:01:14.280> into<00:01:14.580> intake

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
back these lower hoses back into intake

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
back these lower hoses back into intake
manifold<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.229> even<00:01:16.500> though<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> drivers<00:01:17.070> told

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
manifold so even though the drivers told

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
manifold so even though the drivers told
the<00:01:17.460> throttle<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.820> close<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> still<00:01:19.650> keep

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the throttle to close we can still keep

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.460 
the throttle to close we can still keep
the<00:01:20.070> engine<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.729> full<00:01:20.910> power<00:01:21.470> until

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the engine going at full power until

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.930 
the engine going at full power until
they<00:01:22.619> come<00:01:22.830> back<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> throttle<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
they come back into the throttle and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.030 
they come back into the throttle and
there's<00:01:24.570> absolutely<00:01:25.020> no<00:01:25.229> lag<00:01:25.440> at<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
there's absolutely no lag at all and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
there's absolutely no lag at all and
when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> hear<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> cars<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.510> running

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
when you hear the cars out there running

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.930 
when you hear the cars out there running
you<00:01:28.830> hear<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.010> lot<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.220> popping<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> banging

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
you hear a lot of popping and banging

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.780 
you hear a lot of popping and banging
and<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.260> whole<00:01:31.470> system<00:01:32.040> working<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and that is that whole system working to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
and that is that whole system working to
keep<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.420> power<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.770> those<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.220> areas

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
keep the power up so those are the areas

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.180 
keep the power up so those are the areas
we've<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.000> been<00:01:36.090> focusing<00:01:36.660> on<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.190> not

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
we've really been focusing on to not

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.920 
we've really been focusing on to not
only<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.880> power<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.390> being<00:01:39.540> usable

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
only have that power but being usable

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.870 
only have that power but being usable
make<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> drivable<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:41.040> can't<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
make it drivable it can't come on like a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700 
make it drivable it can't come on like a
switch<00:01:42.180> because<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.929> just<00:01:43.080> get<00:01:43.289> massive

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
switch because then you just get massive

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.900 
switch because then you just get massive
amounts<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:43.979> wheel<00:01:44.190> spin<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.580> car<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
amounts of wheel spin in the car is

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:54.570 
amounts of wheel spin in the car is
really<00:01:45.149> difficult<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.750> drive

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.710 

after<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.729> engine<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.180> next<00:01:56.450> thing<00:01:56.600> that

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
after the engine the next thing that

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.469 
after the engine the next thing that
we've<00:01:56.870> done<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.290> transmission<00:01:58.330> when<00:01:59.330> these

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
we've done is transmission when these

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.680 
we've done is transmission when these
cars<00:01:59.750> started<00:02:00.290> they<00:02:00.680> were<00:02:00.740> an<00:02:01.729> H<00:02:01.940> pattern<00:02:02.450> just

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
cars started they were an H pattern just

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.200 
cars started they were an H pattern just
like<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.990> would<00:02:03.080> have<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.410> road<00:02:03.620> car<00:02:04.210> they

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
like you would have in the road car they

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.000 
like you would have in the road car they
were<00:02:05.240> dog<00:02:05.600> engagement<00:02:06.229> which<00:02:06.590> meant<00:02:06.860> instead

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
were dog engagement which meant instead

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.370 
were dog engagement which meant instead
of<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.369> having<00:02:07.520> synchros<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.450> rings<00:02:08.660> you

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
of just having synchros and rings you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.960 
of just having synchros and rings you
actually<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.890> dogs<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.459> each<00:02:10.580> gear<00:02:10.820> that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
actually have dogs on each gear that

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
actually have dogs on each gear that
grabbed<00:02:11.150> each<00:02:11.180> other<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.840> pull<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.590> into<00:02:12.770> gear

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
grabbed each other and pull it into gear

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.850 
grabbed each other and pull it into gear
these<00:02:13.850> are<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.240> sequentially<00:02:14.990> shifted<00:02:15.440> no

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
these are now sequentially shifted no

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.610 
these are now sequentially shifted no
more<00:02:16.040> H<00:02:16.190> pattern<00:02:16.610> there's<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.750> load<00:02:17.990> cell<00:02:18.290> the

more H pattern there's a load cell the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.190 
more H pattern there's a load cell the
shifter<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.370> tells<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.970> engine<00:02:20.300> ECU<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.930> cut
