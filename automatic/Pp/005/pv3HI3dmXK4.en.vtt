00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:03.080
 and 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.020
 such creativity onolbaeva such she 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.859
 sometimes very gentle etc 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.940
 know how the percentage is supersaturated 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.730
 the solution is such a chemical metaphor 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.869
 came to my mind 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.799
 yes that's just but if the salt is dissolved 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.539
 solvent stand win 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.710
 audi transparent 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 and then suddenly something fell to the date of the puppy 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 and bang begins the process 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.589
 crystallization this time 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.279
 her internal flow thats absolutely everything 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.099
 equal to what topic to start the dirt and 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.609
 weighs what about well because here it is 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.869
 state of itself 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.530
 oversaturation don't have to do something and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.570
 then one day I had a girl 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.260
 seminars we did all kinds of exit 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.370
 summer 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.600
 on the sea 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.010
 and she mare hairdresser came to 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.340
 I said Tanya here 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.060
 You know, I really want to cut my hair 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.350
 I now do not know how to this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 treat because so demolition i'm so bad 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.340
 I look 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.620
 she said not just me mentally high 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.860
 qualifications and not inspiring you can 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.890
 may be my models, I agreed 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.350
 and she really is not very beautiful 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.990
 cut it then 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
 and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.490
 Yes, I easily said and forgot about it 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.320
 then suddenly on the promise you need something 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.630
 change 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.190
 and once even I was driving to work and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.120
 suddenly me here 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.960
 the songs themselves come completely 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.740
 not carrying sit down and write a song 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.700
 I now can not be such a start succeed 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 what the second time in the performance wants 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.200
 you can immediately give rise to the sake of giving 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.170

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.550

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.250
 help to change from all sides and about 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.530
