taking a limb off of one branch or a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.380 
taking a limb off of one branch or a
tree<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.550> might<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.239> its

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tree that like this that might be on its

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
tree that like this that might be on its
way<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.570> another<00:00:40.469> big<00:00:40.739> thing<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.460> don't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
way out another big thing is we don't

way out another big thing is we don't
want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> wring<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> tree<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
want to wring the tree if you go all the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
want to wring the tree if you go all the
way<00:00:43.739> around<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.309> tree<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.879> you've

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
way around a tree like this you've

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
way around a tree like this you've
essentially<00:00:46.079> cut<00:00:46.469> off<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.100> its<00:00:47.219> blood

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
essentially cut off all of its blood

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
essentially cut off all of its blood
flow<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> no<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.129> you're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
flow and there is no way in which you're

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.580 
flow and there is no way in which you're
gonna<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.640> able<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.780> tree<00:00:52.050> live<00:00:52.260> if

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
gonna be able to see this tree live if

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
gonna be able to see this tree live if
we<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> save<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> life<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:53.820> trees

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
we want to save the life of these trees

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
we want to save the life of these trees
so<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.079> maybe<00:00:55.199> come<00:00:55.410> back<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
so that we could maybe come back and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.369 
so that we could maybe come back and
harvest<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> summer<00:00:57.449> time<00:00:57.539> get

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
harvest more and in the summer time get

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.950 
harvest more and in the summer time get
some<00:00:58.410> cherries<00:00:59.510> alright<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.629> first<00:01:00.780> thing

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.990 
the tree up and you're ripping strips
out<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> tree<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> Elks<00:01:26.880> and

gonna do is we're gonna cut a strip down
this<00:01:38.460> tree<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.570> gonna<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:39.979> blade

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
this tree I'm just gonna use my blade

this so what we're gonna do we could
have<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> make<00:03:13.650> medicine<00:03:13.920> are<00:03:14.130> we<00:03:16.100> based<00:03:17.100> on

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
have to make medicine are we based on

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.440 
have to make medicine are we based on
the<00:03:17.489> chemistry<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.000> here<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> would<00:03:18.420> say

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the chemistry in here I would say

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.850 
the chemistry in here I would say
tincture<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.260> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.620> your<00:03:19.770> most

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
tincture is going to be your most

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.280 
tincture is going to be your most

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
effective medicine we've got some like

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.680 
effective medicine we've got some like
glycosides<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.430> saponin<00:03:23.910> kind<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.270> groupings

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
glycosides and saponin kind of groupings

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.870 
glycosides and saponin kind of groupings
that<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:25.050> taste<00:03:25.260> for<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> sort<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.459> soapy

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
that can taste for the sort of soapy

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.850 
that can taste for the sort of soapy
compounds<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.690> fill<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.440> other<00:03:28.650> medicinal

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
compounds and fill that other medicinal

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.830 
compounds and fill that other medicinal
stuff<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:29.790> also<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.090> astringent<00:03:30.390> see<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
stuff but also the astringent see the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690 
stuff but also the astringent see the
tannins<00:03:31.260> that'll<00:03:31.890> come<00:03:32.040> out<00:03:32.070> nice<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.400> hot
