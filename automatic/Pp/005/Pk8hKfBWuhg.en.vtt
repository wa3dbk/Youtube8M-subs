pull off this little tab at the top just
like<00:01:27.620> that<00:01:27.920> then<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.090> can<00:01:29.210> go<00:01:29.360> ahead<00:01:29.480> and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
like that then you can go ahead and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.150 
like that then you can go ahead and
squeeze<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.260> into<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.500> molds<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:30.920> want<00:01:31.070> to

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
squeeze it into the molds you want to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.180 
squeeze it into the molds you want to
put<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.400> in<00:01:32.080> be<00:01:33.080> careful<00:01:33.560> as<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.830> chocolate

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
put it in be careful as the chocolate

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.460 
put it in be careful as the chocolate
might<00:01:34.400> be<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> little<00:01:34.940> bit<00:01:35.090> warm<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:38.170> go<00:01:39.170> ahead

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
might be a little bit warm and go ahead

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.900 
might be a little bit warm and go ahead
and<00:01:39.710> be<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> little<00:01:40.070> bit<00:01:40.280> quick<00:01:40.550> during<00:01:40.820> this

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
and be a little bit quick during this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.400 
and be a little bit quick during this
process<00:01:41.360> because<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.780> chocolate<00:01:42.020> will

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
process because the chocolate will

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:50.320 
process because the chocolate will
harden<00:01:42.890> quite<00:01:43.130> quickly<00:01:48.400> like<00:01:49.400> that<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.970> then

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
harden quite quickly like that and then

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.080 
harden quite quickly like that and then
I'm<00:01:50.510> going<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.750> take<00:01:51.020> my<00:01:51.200> pink<00:01:51.680> one<00:01:51.920> now<00:01:52.130> twist

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
I'm going to take my pink one now twist

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.860 
I'm going to take my pink one now twist
the<00:01:53.270> top<00:01:53.420> off<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:55.250> go<00:01:56.210> ahead<00:01:56.540> and

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
the top off of this one and go ahead and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:06.720
