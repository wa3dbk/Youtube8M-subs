okay<00:02:00.799> now<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.759> would<00:02:02.090> also<00:02:02.329> be<00:02:02.539> intensity

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
okay now that would also be intensity

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.349 
okay now that would also be intensity
but<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.530> wouldn't<00:02:03.770> be<00:02:03.920> as<00:02:04.039> effective<00:02:04.359> because

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
but it wouldn't be as effective because

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.719 
but it wouldn't be as effective because
the<00:02:05.659> fear<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.049> death<00:02:06.530> will<00:02:07.009> impede<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
the fear of death will impede the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.500 
the fear of death will impede the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.470 
learning I could also take that 200
repetitions<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.819> instead<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.879> doing<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.330> over

repetitions and instead of doing it over

repetitions and instead of doing it over
three<00:02:17.870> weeks<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.590> could<00:02:19.160> stretch<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.760> over

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
three weeks I could stretch it out over

three weeks I could stretch it out over
three<00:02:20.599> years<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.459> instead<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.360> calling

three years right and instead of calling

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.680 
three years right and instead of calling
you<00:02:23.810> ten<00:02:24.049> times<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.470> day<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:25.489> three<00:02:25.519> weeks<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.299> I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you ten times a day for three weeks if I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.009 
you ten times a day for three weeks if I

a once a week for three years guess what

a once a week for three years guess what
you<00:02:34.370> remember<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> rest<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.239> your<00:02:35.329> life<00:02:35.680> right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you remember the rest of your life right

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.809 
you remember the rest of your life right
you'd<00:02:36.920> never<00:02:37.069> forget<00:02:37.430> that

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you'd never forget that

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.640 
you'd never forget that
whereas<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.269> could<00:02:38.540> squash<00:02:38.930> all<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.380> into

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
whereas I could squash all that into

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.350 
whereas I could squash all that into
frequency<00:02:40.160> into<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> narrow<00:02:40.700> period<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.180> time

frequency into a narrow period of time

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.420 
frequency into a narrow period of time
and<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.930> would<00:02:42.260> eventually<00:02:42.650> forget<00:02:43.160> if<00:02:43.340> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
and you would eventually forget if you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.949 
and you would eventually forget if you
didn't<00:02:43.700> have<00:02:43.760> reinforcement<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.630> with<00:02:44.750> me<00:02:44.840> on

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
didn't have reinforcement you with me on

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.410 
didn't have reinforcement you with me on
that<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.980> when<00:02:46.519> one<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.760> these<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.030> high<00:02:47.360> the
