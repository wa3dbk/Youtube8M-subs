00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
okay once you've got your big holes

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.810 
okay once you've got your big holes
drilled<00:00:27.020> now<00:00:27.740> you're<00:00:27.949> ready<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:28.189> feed<00:00:28.610> these

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
drilled now you're ready to feed these

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.810 
drilled now you're ready to feed these
wires<00:00:29.210> through<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.720> center<00:00:30.110> hole<00:00:30.320> and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
wires through the center hole and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.820 
wires through the center hole and
there's<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.880> grommet<00:00:32.480> that<00:00:32.660> you're<00:00:33.470> gonna<00:00:33.559> have

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
there's a grommet that you're gonna have

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.150 
there's a grommet that you're gonna have
to<00:00:34.150> get<00:00:35.150> into<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:36.050> hole<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.440> well<00:00:36.710> just<00:00:37.040> to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
to get into that hole as well just to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.580 
to get into that hole as well just to
kind<00:00:37.340> of<00:00:37.430> seal<00:00:37.700> it<00:00:37.879> you'll<00:00:38.059> see<00:00:38.329> it<00:00:38.480> it's<00:00:39.379> about

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
kind of seal it you'll see it it's about

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.439 
kind of seal it you'll see it it's about
halfway<00:00:39.890> up<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:40.220> wire<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.970> you'll<00:00:41.330> just

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
halfway up that wire and you'll just

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.780 
halfway up that wire and you'll just
have<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.690> work<00:00:41.930> that<00:00:42.199> in<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.650> get<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:42.920> flush<00:00:43.340> so

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
have to work that in to get it flush so

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.060 
have to work that in to get it flush so
that<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.150> seals<00:00:44.750> off<00:00:45.050> where<00:00:45.320> those<00:00:45.440> wires<00:00:45.739> go

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
that it seals off where those wires go

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.490 
that it seals off where those wires go
and<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.820> last<00:00:47.030> step<00:00:47.300> is<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:47.510> let's<00:00:48.110> bolt<00:00:48.350> it

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
and the last step is just let's bolt it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.610 
and the last step is just let's bolt it
down<00:00:48.699> get<00:00:49.699> your<00:00:49.760> hex<00:00:50.089> bolts<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.870> feed<00:00:51.500> them

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
down get your hex bolts and feed them

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:07.090 
down get your hex bolts and feed them
through<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.890> holes<00:01:05.289> well<00:01:06.289> it's<00:01:06.500> really<00:01:06.860> not

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
through the holes well it's really not

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.980 
through the holes well it's really not
the<00:01:07.280> last<00:01:07.550> step<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:08.180> still<00:01:08.420> have<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:08.690> hook<00:01:08.840> up

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
the last step you still have to hook up

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.900 
the last step you still have to hook up
the<00:01:09.080> wires<00:01:09.259> but<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.250> last<00:01:10.490> step<00:01:10.759> of

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
the wires but it's the last step of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.940 
the wires but it's the last step of
getting<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.649> spoiler<00:01:12.649> mounted<00:01:14.740> it's<00:01:15.740> also

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
getting the spoiler mounted it's also

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.249 
getting the spoiler mounted it's also
important<00:01:16.580> when<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.030> tighten<00:01:17.300> these<00:01:17.630> don't

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
important when you tighten these don't

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.279 
important when you tighten these don't
over<00:01:18.770> tighten<00:01:19.210> remember<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.899> is<00:01:21.080> actually

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
over tighten remember this is actually

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.980 
over tighten remember this is actually
being<00:01:21.740> held<00:01:21.979> in<00:01:22.160> place<00:01:22.310> by<00:01:22.429> plastic<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:23.600> you

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
being held in place by plastic if you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.960 
being held in place by plastic if you
over<00:01:24.470> torque<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:25.009> or<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.340> over<00:01:25.550> tighten<00:01:25.910> it

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
over torque it or you over tighten it

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.760 
over torque it or you over tighten it
you<00:01:26.090> can<00:01:26.270> actually<00:01:26.630> break<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.500> know<00:01:27.619> this

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
you can actually break you know this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.399 
you can actually break you know this
plastic<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.759> could<00:01:28.909> crack<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.689> just<00:01:30.200> be

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
plastic you could crack it so just be

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.109 
plastic you could crack it so just be
careful<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.159> don't<00:01:31.189> go<00:01:31.520> too<00:01:31.580> tight

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
careful that you don't go too tight

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.090 
careful that you don't go too tight
you'll<00:01:32.420> know<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.290> know<00:01:33.380> when<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.650> feel<00:01:33.920> it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
you'll know you know when you feel it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.190 
you'll know you know when you feel it
start<00:01:34.400> really<00:01:34.700> getting<00:01:34.820> firm<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.869> should<00:01:36.110> be

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
start really getting firm that should be

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.649 
start really getting firm that should be
tight<00:01:36.530> enough<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.580> could<00:01:38.000> use<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.240> torque

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
tight enough now you could use a torque

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.929 
tight enough now you could use a torque
wrench<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.290> don't<00:01:39.920> use<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> torque<00:01:40.460> wrench<00:01:40.700> for

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
wrench I don't use a torque wrench for

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.819 
wrench I don't use a torque wrench for
this<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:41.900> know<00:01:41.930> honda<00:01:42.409> recommends

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
with the brake light is a huge safety

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.000 
with the brake light is a huge safety
feature<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.810> think<00:03:32.900> everybody<00:03:33.530> with<00:03:33.740> a<00:03:33.800> gold

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
feature I think everybody with a gold

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.220 
feature I think everybody with a gold
wing<00:03:34.220> should<00:03:34.430> have<00:03:34.610> one<00:03:34.850> not<00:03:35.510> only<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:36.050> my

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
wing should have one not only in my

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.260 
wing should have one not only in my
opinion<00:03:36.380> does<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.040> improve<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.730> looks<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.150> the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
opinion does it improve the looks of the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.820 
opinion does it improve the looks of the
rear<00:03:38.510> end<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.840> bike<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.350> think<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.590> makes<00:03:39.710> a

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
rear end of the bike I think it makes a

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.320 
rear end of the bike I think it makes a
dramatic<00:03:39.980> difference<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.790> appearance<00:03:41.240> of

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
dramatic difference in the appearance of

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.510 
dramatic difference in the appearance of
the<00:03:41.420> bike<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:42.740> it's<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.920> big<00:03:43.130> safety

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
the bike but I think it's a big safety

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.880 
the bike but I think it's a big safety
