00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
preview of it and I thought this is a

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.060 
preview of it and I thought this is a
great<00:00:38.379> size<00:00:38.620> for<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:39.010> kit<00:00:40.769> so<00:00:41.769> let's<00:00:41.920> take<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
great size for a kit so let's take a

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.450 
great size for a kit so let's take a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
look at this is very similar to the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.119 
look at this is very similar to the
other<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.699> range<00:00:48.699> medic<00:00:49.089> bag<00:00:49.269> that<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.289> quite

other the range medic bag that is quite

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.130 
other the range medic bag that is quite
a<00:00:51.190> bit<00:00:51.309> thicker<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.969> has<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.179> room<00:00:52.600> for<00:00:52.899> his

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
a bit thicker that has a room for his
