00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.859 
obviously qualify for the Olympics and
and<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.490> had<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> contend<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.690> with

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and we had to contend with that with

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320 
and we had to contend with that with
their<00:00:19.050> feistiness<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.029> tempo<00:00:21.029> we

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
their feistiness with the tempo we

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.609 
their feistiness with the tempo we
really<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.779> had<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.080> get<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> grip<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
really just had to get a grip of the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.500 
really just had to get a grip of the
game<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.070> thought<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.730> did<00:00:23.760> cut<00:00:24.119> through<00:00:24.359> them

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
game I thought we did cut through them

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.029 
game I thought we did cut through them
quite<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.960> lot<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.619> did<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> lot<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
quite a lot and we did have a lot of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.439 
quite a lot and we did have a lot of
possession<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.580> was<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> little<00:00:27.210> bit

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
possession it was just got a little bit

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.929 
possession it was just got a little bit
hairy<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> end<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.099> mean<00:00:29.760> how

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
hairy at the end there I mean how

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.490 
hairy at the end there I mean how
important<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.539> knowing<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> they<00:00:31.320> would

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
important was it knowing that they would

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.959 
important was it knowing that they would
try<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.800> contain<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:32.520> important<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
try and contain you how important was it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.580 
try and contain you how important was it
to<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.270> your<00:00:33.450> noses<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.899> front<00:00:33.930> rather<00:00:34.469> than

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to get your noses in front rather than

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
to get your noses in front rather than
let<00:00:34.770> them<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> first<00:00:35.399> girl<00:00:35.670> yeah<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
let them have the first girl yeah I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
let them have the first girl yeah I
think<00:00:36.540> we've<00:00:36.780> seen<00:00:36.960> momentum<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.710> think<00:00:37.890> for

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
think we've seen momentum I think for

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
think we've seen momentum I think for
this<00:00:38.070> team<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.489> massive<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.390> can

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this team is massive I think if we can

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.150 
this team is massive I think if we can
get<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> upper<00:00:39.930> hand<00:00:39.960> even<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.070> don't

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
get the upper hand even if we don't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.830 
get the upper hand even if we don't
score<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.820> least<00:00:41.879> kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> build<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
score at least kind of build that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.389 
score at least kind of build that
strength<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> build<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:43.920> power<00:00:44.160> going

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
strength and build back power going

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.450 
strength and build back power going
forward<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.200> it's<00:00:46.200> its<00:00:46.620> massive<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.340> hope

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
forward and it's its massive and I hope

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.100 
forward and it's its massive and I hope
we<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.090> find<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.510> mean

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
we can do that going to find I mean

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
we can do that going to find I mean
you're<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> hell<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.579> winning<00:00:50.850> run<00:00:51.000> with

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you're a hell of a winning run with

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.600 
you're a hell of a winning run with
Great<00:00:51.750> Britain<00:00:51.780> man<00:00:52.590> England<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.219> mean<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Great Britain man England I mean is it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490 
Great Britain man England I mean is it
just<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.969> case<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> used<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just a case that the side is used to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
just a case that the side is used to
winning<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.309> expect<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> win<00:00:56.969> every

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
winning that you expect to win every

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
winning that you expect to win every
time<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> learn<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
time you go out I do think you learn to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
time you go out I do think you learn to
win<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.730> you've<00:00:59.850> seen<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> doctor<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
win I think you've seen the doctor a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
win I think you've seen the doctor a
very<00:01:00.899> good<00:01:01.020> example<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
very good example of that I think you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.709 
very good example of that I think you
know<00:01:02.520> even<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.120> they're<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.239> playing<00:01:03.480> very

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
know even when they're not playing very

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.509 
know even when they're not playing very
well<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.229> find<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.710> way<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> win<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
well they find a way to win and that's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.620 
well they find a way to win and that's
something<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.880> we've<00:01:06.030> talked<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
something that we've talked about as a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.210 
something that we've talked about as a
squad<00:01:06.869> finding<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> win<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.070> win

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
squad finding a way to win you got win

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
squad finding a way to win you got win
ugly<00:01:08.340> you'll<00:01:08.729> win<00:01:08.939> ugly<00:01:09.060> who<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.659> play

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
ugly you'll win ugly who can play

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
ugly you'll win ugly who can play
brilliantly<00:01:10.110> played<00:01:10.619> brilliantly<00:01:10.979> win<00:01:11.220> but

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
brilliantly played brilliantly win but

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.160 
brilliantly played brilliantly win but
it's<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.000> finding<00:01:12.240> away<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.869> building

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it's about finding away and I'm building

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's about finding away and I'm building
momentum<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.830> that's<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.040> we're<00:01:14.130> doing

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
momentum I think that's what we're doing

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
momentum I think that's what we're doing
really<00:01:14.430> well<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> our<00:01:15.540> Alex<00:01:16.140> dance<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
really well one of our Alex dance and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.020 
really well one of our Alex dance and
hit<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> foot<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.729> she<00:01:17.939> might

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

Antwerp<00:01:46.439> I'm<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> hear<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> great<00:01:47.579> side

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Antwerp I'm just to hear a great side

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
Antwerp I'm just to hear a great side
they've<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.450> great<00:01:48.600> players<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.170> we're

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
they've got some great players and we're

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.810 
they've got some great players and we're
going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> manage<00:01:50.220> those<00:01:50.549> but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to really have to manage those but

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120 
going to really have to manage those but
i<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.140> their<00:01:52.409> backline<00:01:52.770> we

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
i think if we can get their backline we

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280 
i think if we can get their backline we
use<00:01:53.460> our<00:01:53.610> transitions<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> intercept<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
use our transitions and intercept and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.719 
use our transitions and intercept and
really<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> go<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.040> them<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.610> why

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
really have a go at them I don't see why

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.999 
really have a go at them I don't see why
we<00:01:56.850> can't<00:01:56.880> win<00:01:57.149> we'll<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> made<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
we can't win we'll see I made the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.370 
we can't win we'll see I made the
decision<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> retire<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.719> change
