00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.299
 welcome again today we are of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.309
 come back and we just have to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 make small in boxing halo 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 master chief connection makes question of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
 minutes returned from the store 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.770
 get it and go I feel pretty 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.630
 excited to do this goes out in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.609
 this time I bought it obviously 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 in a physical way I decided not to buy it from 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 digitally because I went I had the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.180
 experience with advanced warfare that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.150
 the games are too heavy to remind you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.960
 by dayz durÃ¡n warfare I do not know almost 50 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.610
 gigabytes in the collection 60 gigabytes and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 what a crazy action 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510
 simply pass it by downloading everything 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.579
 already complete and unable to play so 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.379
 I decided on this occasion to buy from this 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.210
 way out I think it was a game a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.850
 little more special and that we should of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.440
 have it in a physical way so let's 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 try to move on to what is the little 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.300
 in boxing comes out pretty fast we're going to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 see how this is going around here I have 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.340
 a small cuter worth we will try to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.960
 remove this as quickly as we can 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 only to try to unpack 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.360
 so guys let's see how it is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.370
 this the truth was very 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 I say I'm excited about this the truth 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.300
 I do not know if you have already 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.280
 got it if they've already bought it from 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.260
 physical way digitally but it's 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.720
 that the theme of games and such and its 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.660
 weight is a complete reality is a 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.790
 true madness so just because 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.680
 that I decided I decided on this occasion to 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.150
 do this and you can be a box and not 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.280
 taking advantage of what was the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.630
 way the physical form can make a 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.390
 small a boxing for all of you 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.430
 but I do not know more or less seeing well and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.620
 all this so let's see we have 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.479

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.009

 over here the five beta guardians 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.070
 more or less there and nothing we will see how 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.110
 is that there's going to be going to try we're going to 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.970

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.119

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.800

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.590

 very good so this is really going to 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.720
 take a long time 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.280
 its installation I imagine update and 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.320
 so I'm going to switch to the console 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.910
 quickly to see how it is going and 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.400
 obviously depending on what we have 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.930
 maybe they'll tell you to finish this up 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.490
 that we are going to spend at the moment 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.490
 the console and see how it is going
