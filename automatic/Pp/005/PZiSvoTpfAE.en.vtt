 myself about it but well what 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.629
 It should be important for these for this 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.030
 look like he's a full one, so to speak 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 garage have you go your new one 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.699
 offline mode so to speak and launched 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.189
 a solo session solo online meeting 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.010
 looked for your car in an online 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.390
 Meeting is completely on no 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.920
 you need some money 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.189
 But I invest all the money 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.530
 out again one hundred percent the car 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 You are quite important if your car on the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.369
 the and no tracking installation altogether 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 important that you do it afterwards 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.340
 the car, so to speak 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.909
 go straight and then so is a display 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.049
 the garage is fully occupied 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.670
 which does not need me anymore 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.500

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 he does not go in offline mode then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.810
 The editor is an offline first 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.850
 mode when the offline meeting started 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.720

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.410
 or something else yes if that did 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.970
 you should start the mission and 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.100
 sitting as it were in the car in which there 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.860
