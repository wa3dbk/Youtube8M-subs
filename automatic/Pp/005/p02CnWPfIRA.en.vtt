00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.290
 sÃ£o paulo has just been stage of the national final 'in pan-american ward cyber 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.420
 games 2010 the biggest electronic games league in the world 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:17.250
 this was the eighth edition of the event and brought together true cyber athletes in a 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.789
 SÃ£o Paulo's shopping mall 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.639
 and lost and passed counter-strike tightening 'deadly kombat' 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.069
 to get along in this group is a lot of training and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.560
 and to ensure even more speed and performance and the machines 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.890
 many of these players bet on a practice already famous among users 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.600
 more advanced 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.610
 is the call there were contacts 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.449
 although the process is somewhat complicated 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.870
 the explanation for it is very simple 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.940
 is when the computer component is forced to work on a frequency 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 because it is specified by the manufacturer. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.230
 but this can cause problems with processor overheating 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.490
 system instability and even burn your machine 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.840
 so it goes strong is not for anyone 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.980
 ronaldo is one of the few in brazil who knows how to execute the process of the best 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.140
 way 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.440
 so much is that he is the number one in the ranking of the game is with those 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.340
 Brazilians 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.980
 No. 19 in the ranking 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.880
 there is no need to know who visited naldo showed how he can in some cases 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.700
 to double the rs frequency of a processor 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.920
 and tried to even break the world record in front of everyone will be that he 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.510
 can 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.640
 until the title to the team 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.930
 by the fourth press 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.590
 for having reached among the three powers 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.000
 dressed in black 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400
 I hope I can 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.050
 other sisters the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.230
 It's my daughter born two weeks ago. 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 When the trainer prepares, 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 while cutting the goal 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.549
 one of man's best friends with the earth 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.940
 plus a good processor in case occur in five car 655 models is one 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.959
 big subway reservation 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.209
 is a liquid that would receive the types of the whole system at lower temperatures 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.909
 to minus 6 degrees 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.879
 the first goal attempt at breaking the record was a test model 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.679
 of teeth a thesis has 11 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:33.039
 the three thousand and 200 mega-processor season was raised 6241 megahertz in 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.149
 less than five minutes 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.149
 South American record breaking 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.219
 but there is respect 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.380
 I agree with her 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.490
 alberto aquilani who is a world league he has to suit and properly 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.749
 validated by cpmf 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.939
 and the catheter in the head 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.399
 and we go from two to later afterwards on the other side of the curtain 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.539
 she responds we expect her rival 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.899
 think it's over 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:05.939
 when something with no back and back a new test of intimacy now three shots 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.769
 2006 not only stresses the processor but also the video card here. 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.069
 price peaked at more than 300 brakes per second 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.369
 the result could not be better 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:23.079
 twenty-nine thousand, six hundred and ninety-two points, world record for 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.979
 much higher than the previous number and did not even reach 24 thousand 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:28.979
 points 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.399
 and you know what it's like to be world champion developed all the technique uses 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.689
 the bodies 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.859
 click here 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.119
 that someone very advanced 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:44.180
 and you must participate and learn with the tricolor it remains open from 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.259
 richter 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.159
 if we have nothing to eat 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.089
 already that engine 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:54.149
 if you want to know a little more about the world of overclocking click on the 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:58.429
 link here underneath this video we give you the way to the forums of 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 sites that ronaldo commented on 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.229
 29 '- closed 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.389
 ah
