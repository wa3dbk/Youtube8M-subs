00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.740

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.820
 hello everyone and everyone and people 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.460
 we are here to talk about something that 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.390
 surely it will interest us and it will 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.669
 molar a lot good I wanted to teach it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.000
 these are unpublished images and images 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.339
 taken out of there efe and that you see then 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.080
 the achievements of the advanced game 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:39.710
 warfare but curiously these images 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.530
 are from the profile profile game of 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.219
 player of one of the creators of this 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.109
 game in this profile the achievements come out 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:53.780
 of advanced warfare, 50 achievements 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:59.930
 but see how curious that of the 50 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:02.600
 achievements there are 13 that are hidden achievements what 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.469
 you are watching you want same good then in 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.300
 those achievements 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.700
 Well, look what they put these 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.110
 secret files puts this file 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.100
 secret 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.950
 they will unlock while you play 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.230
 that is, what does this mean? 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.500
 Well, according to my point of view, 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.380
 say that if you spend the campaign or if you 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.659
 you pass certain levels of whatever 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.090
 in multiplayer or certain 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.819
 at certain levels of the campaign or 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.880
 missions is what now is 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.429
 will unlock that but if they are files 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.670
 secrets and the others if they look only 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:46.530
 you do not see those 13 files means 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.240
 that this surely belongs to that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.209
 game mode that we still do not know 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.799
 which is that they wear it both secretly and 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.500
 that it was not that cooperative mode that 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.159
 we see the other day it was a garbage 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.299
 this would be 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.170
 a possible and a possible track towards 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.030
 that secret game mode they do not want 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.150
 still to unveil it and have it so 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.910
 saved is a possible theory that I have 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.910
 okay these are secret files still 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.459
 they have not taken them out, the rest is there 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.390
 rest yes yes you can see what they are 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.910
 but these 13 still can not be seen 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.790
 they are hidden and they also put it 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.640
 The more you play it is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.000
 will unblock people here you have the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.970
 secret archives of achievements still 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.930
 and hope to give you like to subscribe and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.930
