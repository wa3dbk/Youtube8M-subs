00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.869

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.359
 forward they will change I will change my 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.089
 way to explain etc etc 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.279

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.839

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.690
 that all the credits are for him 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.840

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.460
 it is a link I received it from me 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.470
 mediafire to keep it saved I leave 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.330

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.310
 I send a great greeting and many 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.900
 congratulations for your almost one thousand 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.090
 subscribers are very few to 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.750
 get there so it's good to support it and 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.670
 we hope it continues like this 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.530
 ok then we're going to that since 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.360
 we have downloaded the mod we are going to enter 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.010
 to the blog launcher pro I know that it is already 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.720
 updated can serve for any 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.710
 version of the blog launcher but that is 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.180
 compatible with 0.50 points 7.5 ok 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.590
 So good we're going to give in 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.090
 little key here we are going to give 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.000
 in options the unter requires 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 reboot and we're going to give it down where 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.010
 says let's go down where it says activate 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.440
 support for mods and script we activate it 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.740
 and we give you mod script administrator and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.720
 that's how it says move mods and lean scripts in 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.100
 import and then as they have it 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.200
 downloaded also the motorcycle is in the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.740
 description of the video is a gesture a 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.210
 script mod 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.759
 so then we give it in storage 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.590
 local and we look for it where we have it in 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.229
 my case I have it in download and here is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.080
 let's open it and let's go so we 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.090
 charge now if we do not go out and go to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.710
 back still and it's worth 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.119
 there they are now I am going to show you more 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.310
 or less how it works and how it is activated 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.160
 all this we are going to enter a world 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.610
 let me deactivated the volume and well what 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.950
 I'm going to go down so much 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.600
 world if you realize I do not have much 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.760
 side is because well 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.530
 I have the tablet clean and it is 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.460
 excellent so good let's get 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.360
 first the bipac since I do not like it that way 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.920
 I want to ask you if you want 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.690
 start there is a series to start 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.820
 I will record now since I'm good 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.890
 is giving a bit of the I'm going to remove 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.440
 all the animations so that it is 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.940
 see almost no which is what 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.580
 we deactivate everything wait there is worth 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.710
 everything is deactivating now yes we are going 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.060
 to put the table of the crafter that then 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.550
 I'm going to use it and it's for something 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.890
 you will see we will put here and we will 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.230
 to tinker we very important that they have 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.700
 iron or diamond armor because 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 we will use it ok 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.990
 I put all of this on myself so I did not 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.630
 I got so they do not come to me to say 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.910
 it is clear to me I cheated because I 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.210
 trap to show the mod worth it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.980
 what we need is the rack 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.080
 blocks of gold lighter and then 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.760
 logically have a good armor 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.560
 to be able to fight against unemployment 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.510
 so good to activate it we have 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.040
 to do the following give here in the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.740
 gold blocks and put two blocks of 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.670
 gold as it is already assumed not the blocks 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.610
 of gold 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.480
 and then up to see 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.910
 there's one to see, let me go, I do not know 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.150
 because I put this but well anyway I'm 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.220
 bad is worth and we put another then the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.290
 good altar you can say that the altar 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.720
 it's going to stay like they're seeing it 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.190
 one side as you see is they are two blocks of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.050
 gold and two blocks after those of 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.690
 fridge is very easy to get it so 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.520
 well then finally let me put 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.800
 so that it looks nice and does not travel or 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.480
 came a pig is looking towards the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.100
 very beautiful sides but good 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.630
 good is also want to talk that already 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.080
 is going to follow the minecraft version the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.209
 new to good although I was going up here yes that 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.739
 will come out the 0 points 7.6 that then you 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.660
 I bring information if it does not come out in 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.340
 this week or for the next one so 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.900
 well, let's turn it on 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.910
 ignites with the lighter logically 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.200
 we turn it on and it's going to give me a bit of 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.480
 lag or a lot I do not know and 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.720
 already active it is worth listening to the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.180
 pop exploded stem being a little 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.430
 of the ex so that I disconnected a 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.310
 little and good ready as well says you 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.500
 do not you did something like that says there but 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.330
 well in the end this as they see did not appear 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.560
 nothing very important that they have to 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.630
 have is the full difficulty mode 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.030
 that is, if they are not regenerated 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.560
 life so good as they see 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.720
 we are here and good in any 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.710
 moment it may seem that they steal us 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.930
 appears with a steve skin nothing more 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.240
 that there are times that gives them an error and how 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.430
 that recognizes us they eat us says hello 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.590
 in fact it appeared only I did not write it 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.990
 if they are noticing and I appeared 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.000
 hello and look at the power he threw me towards 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.720
 up there is on the side and they saw it 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.370
 disappeared is here brain and it really is 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.440
 that this mod is very good you 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.850
 I recommend that you have one more device 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.190
 or less good so that I support you well 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.110
 this mode and it supports me perfectly 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.120
 but since I'm recording it gives me the 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.310
 as they see but they have many powers 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.900
 There are times when he invokes monsters and teaches you 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.520
 they begin to attack the ranking a sword 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.620
 by day 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.090
 and then you get off rather than low 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.590
 your sword and diamond so why do I 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.720
 I recommend you have an armor 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.669
 complete diamond when you activate this 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.259
 or it is already up to you that this 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.180
 can be used to make a series or not 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.680
 I know what you like but good 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.460
 in the end while you see walking by 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.530
 any side 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.810
 there is the altar and on you do not go 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.900
 to be able to stop until you kill him like that 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.889
 that good then while you see walking 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.330
 germain can come to appear in 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.539
 in front of you and you will start attacking 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.150
 but as they see how it burns that is 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.039
 because it is day but nothing happens and 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.229
 look they appeared there on the side and they're going to 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.599
 hit it ready you hit it actually sounds like 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.400
 a zombie pickman is because he is a 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.530
 shopping pickman only that changing 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.710
 he changed his skin but it's very good 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.729
 mod is very well made for minecraft 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.289
