00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.660 

use<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.870> carpenter<00:01:33.470> square<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.190> three-foot

use a carpenter square and a three-foot

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.490 
use a carpenter square and a three-foot
level<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.330> make<00:01:35.510> sure<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.020> bolts<00:01:36.380> are

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
level to make sure that the bolts are

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.810 
level to make sure that the bolts are
aligned<00:01:36.770> with<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.250> playing<00:01:37.580> surface

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
aligned with the playing surface

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.140 
aligned with the playing surface
properly<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> critical<00:01:40.250> step<00:01:40.370> because

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
properly this is a critical step because

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.420 
properly this is a critical step because
once<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.540> concrete<00:01:42.020> dries<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.070> no<00:01:43.280> way

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
once the concrete dries there is no way

00:01:43.430 --> 00:02:01.450 
once the concrete dries there is no way
to<00:01:43.460> make<00:01:43.700> changes<00:01:59.800> using<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.979> level<00:02:01.340> as<00:02:01.430> a

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
to make changes using the level as a

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.400 
to make changes using the level as a

guide in this picture we can see that
the<00:02:03.649> ground<00:02:03.890> kit<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:04.369> squared<00:02:04.790> on<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.420> playing

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
the ground kit is squared on the playing

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.220 
the ground kit is squared on the playing
