00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.460
 but the amusement parks that 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.090
 they are happy with constant evolution 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.850
 and that evolution must be qualified and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.420
 analyze it very well and we in this 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.900
 park where we have 17 activities today 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.759
 aquatic we had to know what it was 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 that we were missing that was what 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.220
 we were really looking for and what 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.890
 We were looking for the slides of the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 last generations and what we see today 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.020
 here really are the slides of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.769
 last generations the one who is at 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.350
 my back that is the return of the jaguar 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.420
 this is one of the newest slides 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 and modern ones in the world have been 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.160
 manufactured only 30 of those 30 had 2 in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.339
 latin america in some parks of mexico 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.519
 and today we have installed two more 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.579
 in the rest of Latin America not 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.690
 it exists that these corals that makes us 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.140
 that we maintain our expansion with 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.990
 Special slides and the roller coaster 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 we see that mountain on my left 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.750
 Russian is a special design 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.840
 what was made for this park with 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 modern technology to really be able to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 offer something that was different and so 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.880
 it's like we have this roller coaster that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.460
 the same technicians have told us that it is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.830
 the only one in the world is the first 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.590
 they are just building and they are already 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.500
 promoting this game so that it 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.860
 can learn openly in the world 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.200
 but that makes us see again to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 that our amusement park follows 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.830
 being a pioneer but something that is more 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.220
 important and that for us it is very 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.020
 satisfactory and I like to say it and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.929
 that I hope that you in the cable to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.390
 silo put the gentlemen who installed 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.039
 this game installed in the world 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.319
 around about 80 parks 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.960
 amusements and the technician told me 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.690
 main of them I have installed in 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.450
 everywhere and this park is the park 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.940
 cutest I know is the park 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.850
 better maintained and the park that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.430
 Really 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.760
 I see that it's going to be better enjoyed like that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 that guatemala has the best park them 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.230
 I make the invitation come and meet those 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.230
 slides and enjoy them
