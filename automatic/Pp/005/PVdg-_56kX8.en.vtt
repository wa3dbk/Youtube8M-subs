00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

we've<00:00:00.210> developed<00:00:00.659> one<00:00:00.810> of<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.930> first<00:00:00.989> fully

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
we've developed one of the first fully

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.210 
we've developed one of the first fully
mobile<00:00:02.340> grass<00:00:02.669> pellet<00:00:03.120> mills<00:00:03.300> in<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.600> world

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
mobile grass pellet mills in the world

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.619 
mobile grass pellet mills in the world
by<00:00:05.220> being<00:00:05.490> completely<00:00:05.879> mobile<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.450> go

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
by being completely mobile we go

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.540 
by being completely mobile we go
directly<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.259> farm<00:00:07.529> process<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> farm

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
directly to the farm process on the farm

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.580 
directly to the farm process on the farm
leave<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> pellets<00:00:09.719> at<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> farmer<00:00:10.230> or<00:00:10.380> help

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
leave the pellets at the farmer or help

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.370 
leave the pellets at the farmer or help
the<00:00:11.490> farmer<00:00:11.790> sell<00:00:12.000> them<00:00:12.150> locally<00:00:12.540> that's<00:00:13.139> when

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the farmer sell them locally that's when

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530 
the farmer sell them locally that's when
a<00:00:13.410> light<00:00:13.710> went<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.429> head<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.299> could

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a light went on in my head that I could

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.050 
a light went on in my head that I could
if<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.199> heat<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.800> own<00:00:16.980> home<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.760> grass

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
if I could heat my own home with grass

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.689 
if I could heat my own home with grass
that<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> grew<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> our<00:00:22.380> thought<00:00:22.590> process<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
that I grew so our thought process is to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.210 
that I grew so our thought process is to
take<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.150> big<00:00:24.689> hay<00:00:24.869> bales<00:00:27.890> compress<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.070> eight

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
take the big hay bales compress it eight

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.660 
take the big hay bales compress it eight
times<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:33.770> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.890> turn<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
times to one kind of turn it into the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.300 
times to one kind of turn it into the
smaller<00:00:35.910> pellets<00:00:36.360> right<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> farm

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.450 

it's<00:00:43.700> basically<00:00:44.680> palletization<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:46.100> a

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
it's basically palletization is a

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.910 
it's basically palletization is a
densification<00:00:47.060> process<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.200> we're<00:00:48.530> taking

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
densification process and we're taking

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.549 
densification process and we're taking
hay<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:49.670> bales<00:00:50.180> we're<00:00:50.540> chopping<00:00:50.720> it<00:00:50.989> up<00:00:51.080> we're

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
hay and bales we're chopping it up we're

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.130 
hay and bales we're chopping it up we're
grinding<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.220> finally<00:00:52.730> we're<00:00:53.420> adding<00:00:53.780> steam

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
grinding and finally we're adding steam

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.710 
grinding and finally we're adding steam
and<00:00:54.559> then<00:00:55.040> we're<00:00:55.520> pelletizing<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.480> through<00:00:56.690> a

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
and then we're pelletizing it through a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.660 
and then we're pelletizing it through a
pellet<00:00:57.050> mill<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.500> then<00:00:57.950> cooling<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.460> it's

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
pellet mill and then cooling it it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.549 
pellet mill and then cooling it it's
just<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.910> densification<00:00:59.330> process<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.410> just

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
just a densification process that just

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.200 
just a densification process that just
creates<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.070> higher<00:01:01.309> quality<00:01:01.940> higher

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
creates a higher quality higher

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.150 
creates a higher quality higher
efficiency<00:01:02.870> fuel<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.739> great<00:01:03.949> thing<00:01:04.100> about

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
efficiency fuel the great thing about

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.070 
efficiency fuel the great thing about
grass<00:01:04.550> is<00:01:04.790> if<00:01:04.879> they<00:01:04.970> have<00:01:05.119> natural<00:01:05.360> lignans

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
grass is if they have natural lignans

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.350 
grass is if they have natural lignans
which<00:01:06.410> are<00:01:06.920> act<00:01:07.190> as<00:01:07.369> natural<00:01:07.520> binders<00:01:08.150> in<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
which are act as natural binders in the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.630 
which are act as natural binders in the
peloton<00:01:08.690> pelleting<00:01:09.320> process<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.190> we<00:01:10.280> have<00:01:10.400> no

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
peloton pelleting process so we have no

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.430 
peloton pelleting process so we have no
additives<00:01:11.119> whatsoever<00:01:11.300> what<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:11.930> put<00:01:12.140> in<00:01:12.260> is

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
additives whatsoever what you put in is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.780 
additives whatsoever what you put in is
what<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.740> get<00:01:12.860> out<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.160> put<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.460> in<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> ton<00:01:13.760> of

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
what you get out you put it in a ton of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.490 
what you get out you put it in a ton of
grass<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.090> get<00:01:14.420> out<00:01:14.510> of<00:01:14.630> tonne<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.810> pellets<00:01:15.200> so

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
grass you get out of tonne of pellets so

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.200 
grass you get out of tonne of pellets so
that's<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.009> idea<00:01:16.130> behind<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.759> is<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's the idea behind it is that the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.999 
that's the idea behind it is that the
money<00:01:17.420> put<00:01:17.720> into<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.050> smell<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.830> money

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
money put into the smell and the money

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.790 
money put into the smell and the money
put<00:01:19.310> into<00:01:19.430> making<00:01:19.820> pellets<00:01:20.360> is<00:01:20.810> paid<00:01:21.200> back<00:01:21.500> and

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
put into making pellets is paid back and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.859 
put into making pellets is paid back and
more<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.000> fact<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.300> you<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.630> higher

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
more in the fact that you have a higher

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.940 
more in the fact that you have a higher
quality<00:01:24.410> fuel<00:01:25.420> 100<00:01:26.420> gallons<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.320> heating<00:01:27.500> oil

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
quality fuel 100 gallons of heating oil

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.310 
quality fuel 100 gallons of heating oil
is<00:01:28.190> equivalent<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.030> ton<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.390> grass<00:01:29.780> pellet

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
is equivalent to a ton of grass pellet

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920 
is equivalent to a ton of grass pellet
and<00:01:30.440> we<00:01:30.530> do<00:01:30.710> think<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.690> economically<00:01:32.690> it

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
and we do think that the economically it

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.560 
and we do think that the economically it
would<00:01:33.140> get<00:01:33.320> better<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.280> better<00:01:34.640> as<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.300> price

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
would get better and better as the price

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.760 
would get better and better as the price
of<00:01:35.780> oil

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
of oil

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.920 
of oil
we<00:01:37.250> start<00:01:37.580> out<00:01:37.760> with<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.000> concept<00:01:38.510> of<00:01:38.720> how<00:01:38.900> we

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
we start out with the concept of how we

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.590 
we start out with the concept of how we
could<00:01:39.229> get<00:01:39.409> farmers<00:01:40.400> involved<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.299> a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
could get farmers involved in a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.480 
could get farmers involved in a
renewable<00:01:42.170> energy<00:01:42.350> business<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.220> taking

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
renewable energy business and taking

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.730 
renewable energy business and taking
products<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.150> they<00:01:44.330> could<00:01:45.020> not<00:01:45.200> use<00:01:45.440> for

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
products that they could not use for

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.240 
products that they could not use for
anything<00:01:45.920> else<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.690> turning<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.810> into

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
anything else and turning it into

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.770 
anything else and turning it into
resource<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.490> use<00:01:49.640> on<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.940> farm<00:01:50.119> or<00:01:50.450> for<00:01:50.659> them

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
resource to use on the farm or for them

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.990 
resource to use on the farm or for them
to<00:01:50.990> sell<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.920> way<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.220> keeps<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.670> land<00:01:52.940> a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
to sell so this way it keeps the land a

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.880 
to sell so this way it keeps the land a
little<00:01:53.090> more<00:01:53.330> productive<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.170> take<00:01:54.710> your

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
little more productive you can take your

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.290 
little more productive you can take your
leftover<00:01:55.369> hey<00:01:55.490> at<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.700> end<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.940> year<00:01:56.149> and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
leftover hey at the end of the year and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.639 
leftover hey at the end of the year and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
couple of years of development so we

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.140 
couple of years of development so we
really<00:02:36.069> feel<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.430> we're<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.790> point<00:02:37.000> now

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150

where we are starting to actually

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.479 
where we are starting to actually
optimize<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.510> system<00:02:40.750> we've<00:02:41.200> made<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> ton<00:02:42.370> an

we're doing that in two three hours we

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.759

the idea of a local energy economy and
this<00:03:10.989> kind<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.260> goes<00:03:11.440> along<00:03:11.620> with<00:03:11.980> local<00:03:12.370> food

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
this kind of goes along with local food

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.809 
this kind of goes along with local food
too<00:03:13.420> which<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> big<00:03:14.170> thing<00:03:14.200> now<00:03:14.819> we're

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
too which is a big thing now we're

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.729 
too which is a big thing now we're

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the idea that a farmer might be able to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.380 
the idea that a farmer might be able to

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
people to develop other other pieces of

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.810 
people to develop other other pieces of
the<00:06:15.020> puzzle<00:06:15.470> to<00:06:15.650> where<00:06:15.830> when<00:06:16.130> they<00:06:16.280> all<00:06:16.490> start

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
the puzzle to where when they all start

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.660 
the puzzle to where when they all start
to<00:06:16.880> fit<00:06:17.150> together<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.800> know<00:06:18.920> lots<00:06:19.220> of<00:06:19.370> small

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
to fit together you know lots of small

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.790 
to fit together you know lots of small
pieces<00:06:19.970> make<00:06:20.420> up<00:06:20.630> make<00:06:20.870> a<00:06:20.900> big<00:06:21.200> dent<00:06:21.440> in<00:06:21.620> the

pieces make up make a big dent in the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.250 
pieces make up make a big dent in the
big<00:06:21.950> problem<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.760> hope<00:06:23.510> that<00:06:23.720> it<00:06:23.840> becomes<00:06:23.930> a

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
big problem I hope that it becomes a

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.290 
big problem I hope that it becomes a
