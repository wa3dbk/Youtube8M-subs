00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.790
 in the line-up of bert van marwijk rafael van dervaart starts in the base 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.160
 dirk kuyt in the rush hour and that means a place on the couch 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.439
 for klaas jan huntelaar 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.829
 The Netherlands starts the match strongly, this is a corner of Van der Vaart 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.749
 that is headed away 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.900
 then brought back again by van bommel 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.490
 with a van dervaart team who are always free to make good crosses 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.159
 in May the young 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.159
 The Netherlands is already up for 9 hours 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.649
 nijnsel de jong became father of the week and now there is the first international goal 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.290
 a great start for the Dutch national team 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 and therefore satisfaction with coach Bert van Marwijk 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 and orange it also goes after that a bump 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.480
 heitinga 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.130
 endurance went but the ball does play so it may be four of 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.430
 press with them earder fan page on mopeds that could have been the 2 0 but 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 Robben hits the outside of the pole 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.800
 this way the netherlands gets a lot of chances in the first phase of the match 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 good football here at a fast pace 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380
 another robot 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.020
 schuiteman's day with a nice heel there is bommel who has all the time and then 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.140
 is it hit again? 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.600
 after fifteen minutes there is 2 0 through a hit by mark van bommel 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.500
 And there is no dirt in the air for the Netherlands 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.210
 quiet in the corner 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 koen list without a goalkeeper from iceland is hopeless and all that 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 The Netherlands continues with Robert 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.670
 watch out with a change of gear with the right and the salvation of green 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.870
 stays sun 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.860
 that is one-way traffic 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.250
 and the Netherlands has no problem with iceland than here 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.290
 list sun 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.790
 everything is actually going well 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.790
 only the goals are missing then this attack with vanpersie 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.800
 van Bommel van Persie Van der Vaart van Persie Beautiful 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.600
 stands in the way of a goal 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 the most beautiful attack from the first half with a bowl of van dervaart 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.730
 van van persie on the pole 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.029
 hit it once 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.209
 well done and robben must then make the 3 0 but does 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.239
 the list to redo with the rescue 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.530
 so the only dissatisfaction at the bank is the number of hits in the first 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:18.269
 half 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.699
 the second half goes 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.419
 all a bit stiffer but one still gets a few chances with 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:23.969
 for example a walk 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.699
 but again it does not score 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.889
 for example, Germany was allowed to grab some balls for Iceland until its day 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.249
 every 88th minute 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 Iceland and STDs 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.479
 the second goal 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.219
 in the qualification series 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.349
 protoscar does not respond to the line 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.349
 disclaimer 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.209
 a nice free kick 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.359
 made on the bar 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.179
 no goal belongs to klaas jan huntelaar 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.079
 the final signal means that the netherlands is positioned 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.039
 for the world championship in south africa 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.509
 so happy faces 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:06.399
 because the Netherlands can be satisfied without problems to South Africa
