now<00:02:50.040> while<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.579> doing<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.090> let<00:02:51.390> me<00:02:51.480> remind

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
now while I'm doing this let me remind

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.140 
now while I'm doing this let me remind
you<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:55.349> electronic<00:02:55.920> items<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.519> prone

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
you that the electronic items are prone

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.750 
you that the electronic items are prone
to<00:02:57.180> electric<00:02:57.840> shock<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.370> you're<00:02:59.549> wearing

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
to electric shock so if you're wearing

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.479 
to electric shock so if you're wearing
socks<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.480> carpet<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.500> may<00:03:01.799> not<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.250> good

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
socks on carpet that may not be a good

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.180 
socks on carpet that may not be a good
idea<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.200> we're<00:03:04.410> putting<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.769> screws<00:03:05.099> back

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
idea so we're putting the screws back

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.150 
idea so we're putting the screws back
and<00:03:05.750> other<00:03:06.750> things<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.410> whenever<00:03:07.799> you're

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
and other things is whenever you're

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.920 
and other things is whenever you're
messing<00:03:08.549> with<00:03:08.579> any<00:03:08.970> kind<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.530> computer<00:03:10.530> part

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
messing with any kind of computer part

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.090 
messing with any kind of computer part
the<00:03:13.040> if<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.340> shot<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.750> item<00:03:16.110> because<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:16.980> is

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
the if you shot the item because it is

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.349 
the if you shot the item because it is
metal<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:18.389> may<00:03:18.720> damage<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.230> equipment<00:03:20.359> so

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
metal it may damage the equipment so

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:29.910 
metal it may damage the equipment so
let's<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.350> kind<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:23.030> remember<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:26.060> myself

insert it be careful not to bend or
break<00:03:37.989> any<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.739> metal<00:03:39.069> problems<00:03:39.489> just

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
break any of the metal problems just

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.350 
break any of the metal problems just
slide<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.790> not<00:03:42.940> going<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> be<00:03:43.239> an

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
slide it in and it's not going to be an

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.180 
slide it in and it's not going to be an
easy<00:03:43.510> slide<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.380> will<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.739> little<00:03:44.950> tough

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
easy slide in it will be a little tough

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.690 
easy slide in it will be a little tough
but<00:03:45.670> that's<00:03:46.600> okay<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.350> then<00:03:48.160> we<00:03:48.340> will<00:03:48.489> start

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
but that's okay and then we will start

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.059 
but that's okay and then we will start
screwing<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.300> everything<00:03:50.910> back<00:03:52.620> okay<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.890> we

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
screwing in everything back okay so we

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.650 
screwing in everything back okay so we
got<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.400> back<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:54.970> now<00:03:55.120> what<00:03:55.300> we<00:03:55.450> want<00:03:55.569> to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
got that back in and now what we want to

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.850 
got that back in and now what we want to
do<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:56.110> put<00:03:56.500> on<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.800> little<00:03:57.010> cover<00:03:58.680> should<00:03:59.680> go

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
do is put on this little cover should go

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.610 
do is put on this little cover should go
on<00:04:00.010> very<00:04:00.250> simple<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.930> then<00:04:01.930> we<00:04:02.080> screw<00:04:02.380> in<00:04:02.530> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
on very simple and then we screw in the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.530 
on very simple and then we screw in the
last<00:04:02.830> screw<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:06.190> is<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.430> we<00:04:06.880> are<00:04:07.030> done<00:04:07.209> as

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
last screw and that is it we are done as

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.000 
last screw and that is it we are done as
far<00:04:07.690> as<00:04:07.810> changing<00:04:08.019> out<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.560> hard<00:04:08.830> drive

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
far as changing out the hard drive

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.780 
far as changing out the hard drive
what's<00:04:09.970> left<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.360> do<00:04:10.660> now<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.670> you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
what's left to do now is that what you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.420 
what's left to do now is that what you
need<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.090> do<00:04:13.299> is<00:04:13.830> whenever<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:15.100> boot<00:04:15.280> up<00:04:15.370> your

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
need to do is whenever you boot up your
