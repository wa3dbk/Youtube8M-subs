overall<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.400> does<00:01:23.580> seem<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:23.970> fairly<00:01:24.390> well

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
overall it does seem to be fairly well

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
drops here and there it does the job

drops here and there it does the job
well<00:01:29.329> secondly<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.570> Crysis<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.320> use

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
well secondly like Crysis you can use

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
well secondly like Crysis you can use
your<00:01:31.560> binoculars<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.159> tag<00:01:32.369> enemies<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> the

from<00:01:47.460> point<00:01:47.670> A<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> point<00:01:48.119> B<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> game

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
from point A to point B and the game

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
from point A to point B and the game
will<00:01:49.259> allow<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.680> choose<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> manner<00:01:50.340> in

will allow you to choose the manner in
which<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> either<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.079> in

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
which you do so you can either go in

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080 
which you do so you can either go in
