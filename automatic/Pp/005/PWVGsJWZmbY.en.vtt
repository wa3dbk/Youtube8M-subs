00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.610
 and 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 so that's it's all good night and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.770
 welcome to this special video on 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.990
 the collectors of assinie Frieden Haiti 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060
 so how sogitec the special edition 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 that power right now that is at the price 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.240
 70 euros there will always be I 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.680
 always given the maximum price and he 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.210
 must know that on pc is always 10 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.750
 euros less but I always gave 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 a single price is the maximum price this 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.930
 edition actually includes a mission 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820
 extra 30 minutes of play 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.890
 additional ones called the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.730
 chemical revolution 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.200
 I find that for 70 euros 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.450
 all this to have a single mission 30 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.580
 minutes more is still seen 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.770
 qu'ubisoft likes to inflate the number 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.490
 of minutes I think it's rather 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.540
 a scam at the level of this edition 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.600
 second edition is the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.580
 bastille edition which is priced at 70 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.229
 euros 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.850
 so she understands a steelbook that has 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 still really class one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 artbook that looks pretty friendly 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 the original soundtrack and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 exclusive lithographs and as well as 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 two solo missions for nearly 45 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.840
 minutes of sas play is collector at the price 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 70 euros on pc at the price of 80 on 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.960
 others yes I was wrong 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
 for me that's okay it's a price that is 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 quite justified in relation to what is 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.530
 given in physical content then to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.319
 traditions it's the gold edition that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.810
 allows to have the price of 80 euros which 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:47.579
 is that on pc download the season pass 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.889
 as well as the season pass as well as the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.780
 game in complete edition so strong this 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.749
 edition of our lady who is 100 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.579
 euros so that 90 on pc that contains 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.109
 a box that is really class one 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.300
 artbook the soundtracks the 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.570
 statuette of arnaud with the flag of 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.710
 France as well as it is posed on a 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.810
 gargoyle as well as lithographs 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.090
 the two solo missions for 100 euros 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 I think it's pretty good 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.690
 that there is not that is enough damage 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.370
 it's a steelbook I would have liked when 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.080
 same customer a steelbook as it is 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.870
 still a fairly collector's edition 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.080
 and that ambitions just below there 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.570
 if the ebook then last edition 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.930
 who is publishing the collective kitchen 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.580
 christ who understands to cl book who is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.800
 less class than the other a map of 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.390
 paris lithograph an impression on 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.170
 canvas an art book a music box a 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.420
 tarot game 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.390
 the original soundtrack a statuette 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.640
 of arnaud on the guillotine for me at 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.500
 price of 150 euros it's really 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.710
 Really pretty fucking really fucked 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.650
 really too expensive since 150 bull the 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.710
 only trick that can confirm the 150 bowl 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.540
 it's the statuette the res an artbook it 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.460
 goes the music box what is it 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.460
 do not care the tarot game even more 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.280
 there is only one print on canvas 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.440
 compared to sins fluid 4 black flag 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.880
 who had two and the edition was 10 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.510
 euros cheaper boxing is not as 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.730
 cool that soldier 6,34 black style flag 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.709
 a lot same very simple logo of 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 killers he is really more than 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.360
 the one beyond the edition from below 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.709
 below so frankly me I 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.580
 find that there is a little bit 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.920
 scam for 150 euros 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.320
 on this I think I 've messed you up 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.239
 your pleasure to buy 7 collector bah 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.550
 yes but sorry but here it is 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.320
 the scammed down on this so on this one 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.970
 finish this video then as the 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.740
 month collectors can be the one that I 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.620
 would take this is where 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.670
 our lady of paris i think besides 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.100
 that's the one I'm going to take 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.390
 since the guillotine ok the statue she 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.900
 is really kassoma the statuette she 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.450
 is on sale two weeks after at 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.600
 ubisoft so frankly 50 balls in 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.580
 more why for nothing at all 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.350
 that the edition is really worth 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.900
 really nothing i think the editing 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.250
 think i'm back flag the valleys more 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.990
 she was still 10 euros less 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.190
 expensive so I advise you not to 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.350
 take this acquisition but not 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.910
 do what you want on what we 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.930
 so ends this little video me 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.830
 I find you very soon for 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.209
 a next video I say thank you 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.630

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.630
 him
