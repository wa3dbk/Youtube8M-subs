00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:15.920
 Hello everyone, we will cook today 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:22.080
 Classic stuffing for ravioli cutlets 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:24.510
 for a start we cooked its meat 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 do that started 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.570
 who is the meat grinder who in the combine who himself 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.200
 I cut very finely 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:44.390
 I have already cut everything and now I am cooking 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:47.750
 onion onion can be crumbled in a meat grinder but 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.989
 I think that 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.469
 eat but basically i know that 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.469
 tiny lu 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.820
 stuffing and it tastes better here the main thing 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:05.760
 if when you make onions in a meat grinder 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:13.049
 You should not start the logo because 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:18.320
 turning on the sponge comes out very bitterness and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:23.180
 mince then in dumplings in patties 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.240
 starts a little bitter but when the onion 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 Crumble this does not happen this one 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
 bitterness 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.829
 with pressure when 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 grinder you do here and bitterness and not 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.729
 it happens 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.690
 why i know because i know what if 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.240
 releasing 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.400
 I hear a lot of things that taste better and I'm alone 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 on this principle, too, through a meat grinder 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.020
 missed a lot of onion and let it go and have 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.360
 I get bitter later on this is why I bow 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.360
 just fine fine 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.940
 knife at me very good as Croche 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:18.950
 it seems big but when kneading 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:21.280
 minced it all divided into parts 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:27.380
 will be crayons 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:32.050
 Further process I will show you here I bow 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.520
 all crumbled now I omit here 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:43.459
 pepper wolves 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:44.360
 I'm here a mixture of 5 peppers let pepper I still 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.730
 more 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.050
 but this is only let you go 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.480
 kebab and curry seasoning 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.310
 here's a little bit like this comin for taste 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.180
 to improve but in the classic version 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:06.620
 also such things do not go here go go 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:13.160
 I only have black pepper 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:16.150
 the addition of a classic basis with his 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.150
 additions 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.719
 I will now spice up 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.489
 and put mince here 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.910
 here it is necessary to knead hands 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.610
 Now I will knead it I do not you 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.069
 I will show the whole process 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:53.140
 I'll show you how I beat 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.980
 knead the meat while kneading not 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.629
 forget 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.569
 sometimes try controlling salt 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.810
 minutes and here is just what i forgot here 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:09.420
 start up now i'm starting here one more 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.420
 ingredient don't be surprised 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.009
 and here i am going to milk 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:31.250
 who does not like milk let the water milk 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:37.070
 can be replaced with water and I always let 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.539
 I like milk and taste better 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.090
 you never tried with milk 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:46.550
 try maybe your dish somewhere too 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.820
 maybe you will like it more here of course 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:56.060
 would let butter 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:59.360
 frozen but pork fatty dishes 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.520
 and if it is purely out of beef would have been in 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.020
 what up 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.070
 personal and weak lowered necessarily but 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 here I will not let it so I will now 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.539
 knead 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.470
 until it is completely quite homogeneous 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.470
 by weight 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.250
 Well, all the stuffing I have now ready it 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.720
 discard now about mincemeat this stuffing 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.440
 me for dumplings 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:33.889
 for cutlets if you make headlights let 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:37.159
 here a couple of eggs at all for the guest of course 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.789
 there is still white bread but we walked ourselves 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.690
 are cooking 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:45.070
 I will not add bread as I am 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.680
 I have seen enough and fed on bread cutlets 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.780
 diners where we worked so here 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.400
 I will say another little secret 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.169
 if you where entered the cafe 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.330
 I highly recommend you never 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:06.820
 buy burgers since we cooked and I 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.470
 no doubt they are preparing all the 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.380
 because we let besides her bread 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:17.810
 dock bread allowed we still allowed her 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.169
 raw potatoes for the softness of them but not 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.770
 I play there and there were some things too 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.800
 so I always let 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.009
 neither of which I will not I will usually 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.240
 minced pork and now I'm this way 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:37.620
 I will beat him to get enough 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.990
 oxygenated and was soft gentle dumplings 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.819
 this is my quarter dumplings with each 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.560
 how much yes I want to do right away 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:49.050
 semi-finished dough I prepared 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.979
 in the bread maker, but in the meantime I'm here with 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:57.180
 I mince stuffing and now minutes here I am 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:07:01.259
 so I will beat it to get enough 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.680
 oxygen and will be in the dumplings be 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:07.740
 tender soft without any bread without 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.009
 any potato and delicious without any 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.979
 glutamate 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:18.500
 so cook with pleasure 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:18.500
 angel for you to eat all the while
