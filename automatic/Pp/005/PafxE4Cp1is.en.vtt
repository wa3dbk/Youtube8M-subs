but anyway getting right into the first

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.200 
but anyway getting right into the first
thing<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.490> show<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.670> guys<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
thing that I want to show you guys is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359 
thing that I want to show you guys is
this<00:00:18.420> picture<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> if<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.740> look<00:00:19.859> only<00:00:19.980> right

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
this picture and if you look only right

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
this picture and if you look only right
that<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> actually<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.570> Huntley<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.619> is

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that is actually the Huntley and it is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.769 
that is actually the Huntley and it is
in<00:00:22.980> traffic<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.090> single-player

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
in traffic and this is in single-player

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.140 
in traffic and this is in single-player
so<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> looks<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.590> DLC<00:00:26.279> cars<00:00:26.519> will<00:00:26.699> actually

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
so it looks like DLC cars will actually

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.390 
so it looks like DLC cars will actually
be<00:00:27.269> spawning<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> game<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.500> regular<00:00:29.130> cars

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
be spawning in the game as regular cars

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.490 
be spawning in the game as regular cars
which<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.029> actually<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:30.960> cool<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.320> know<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which is actually really cool I know I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.870 
which is actually really cool I know I
kind<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.890> mentioned<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> screenshot

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
kind of mentioned that in a screenshot

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.940 
kind of mentioned that in a screenshot
that<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.360> saw<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.899> couple<00:00:34.410> weeks<00:00:34.559> back<00:00:34.680> from

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
that we saw a couple weeks back from

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.380 
that we saw a couple weeks back from
Rockstar<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.880> there<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
Rockstar when there was one of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
Rockstar when there was one of the
hipster<00:00:36.780> DLC<00:00:37.170> cars<00:00:37.410> parked<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.950> parking<00:00:38.309> lot

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
hipster DLC cars parked in a parking lot

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.580 
hipster DLC cars parked in a parking lot
but<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:40.140> clear

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
but now it's a little bit more clear

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
but now it's a little bit more clear
that<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.489> DLC<00:00:41.879> cars<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.360> spawn<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that the DLC cars will spawn in the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.740 
that the DLC cars will spawn in the
traffic<00:00:43.680> which<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.890> awesome<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.690> we

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
traffic which is awesome because now we

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.709 
traffic which is awesome because now we
can<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.800> variety<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> cars<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
can have more variety of cars in the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 
can have more variety of cars in the
game<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:49.559> probably<00:00:49.710> carry<00:00:50.070> over

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
game now this will probably carry over

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
game now this will probably carry over
into<00:00:50.670> online<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> doubt<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.440> be

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
into online but I doubt that we will be

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.990 
into online but I doubt that we will be
able<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> store<00:00:53.250> these<00:00:53.430> cars<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.910> will

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
able to store these cars it will

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
able to store these cars it will
probably<00:00:54.360> say<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> does<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.890> some<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
probably say like it does with some of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
probably say like it does with some of
the<00:00:56.250> other<00:00:56.460> high-end<00:00:57.090> vehicles<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the other high-end vehicles like you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
the other high-end vehicles like you
know<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.469> too<00:00:58.710> hot<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.370> garage<00:00:59.579> but

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
know it's too hot for your garage but

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
know it's too hot for your garage but
either<00:01:00.420> way<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.140> definitely<00:01:01.530> really

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
either way that is definitely really

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.410 
either way that is definitely really
awesome<00:01:02.340> another<00:01:02.789> thing<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> picture

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
awesome another thing about this picture

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
awesome another thing about this picture
that's<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> cool<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.710> probably

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that's kind of cool and you probably

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
that's kind of cool and you probably
notice<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:06.020> unnoticeable<00:01:07.020> as

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
notice that it's not as unnoticeable as

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.210 
notice that it's not as unnoticeable as
some<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.439> other<00:01:07.619> stuff<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
some of this other stuff but you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
some of this other stuff but you
actually<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> wear<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> helmet<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.140> have

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
actually when you wear a helmet you have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
actually when you wear a helmet you have
the<00:01:10.470> helmet<00:01:10.799> outline<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.549> pretty

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the helmet outline now that's pretty

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
the helmet outline now that's pretty
cool<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.299> wondering<00:01:12.990> though<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> turn

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
cool I'm wondering though if we can turn

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
cool I'm wondering though if we can turn
that<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.939> sometimes

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that on or off because I know sometimes

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
that on or off because I know sometimes
having<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.350> helmet<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.369> outline

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
having that helmet the little outline

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
having that helmet the little outline
there<00:01:18.090> sometimes<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> gets<00:01:19.049> annoying<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
there sometimes it gets annoying but

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
there sometimes it gets annoying but
that's<00:01:20.280> definitely<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.479> great

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that's definitely a really great

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
that's definitely a really great
addition<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.590> game<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.340> move<00:01:23.490> on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
addition to the game if we move on

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
addition to the game if we move on
though<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.509> another<00:01:24.900> picture<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.740> CVG

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
though this is another picture from CVG

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
though this is another picture from CVG
and<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.240> Ponte<00:01:27.780> dukes<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.470> you

guys<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:29.220> saw<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> first<00:01:29.640> picture<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
guys we saw the first picture of the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
guys we saw the first picture of the
Dukes<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:31.290> were<00:01:31.530> wondering<00:01:32.009> whether<00:01:32.250> or

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
Dukes people were wondering whether or

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.670 
Dukes people were wondering whether or
not<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.570> regular<00:01:34.079> Dukes<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.560> if

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
not we will have the regular Dukes or if

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
not we will have the regular Dukes or if
it'll<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> Duke<00:01:35.670> Oh<00:01:35.850> death<00:01:36.090> which<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it'll be just the Duke Oh death which I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
it'll be just the Duke Oh death which I
think<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.930> called<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:38.040> some

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
think it's called and now we have some

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.710 
think it's called and now we have some
confirmation<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> regular<00:01:39.360> Dukes<00:01:39.570> will

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
confirmation that the regular Dukes will

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.090 
confirmation that the regular Dukes will
be<00:01:39.810> back<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.290> obviously<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
be back now obviously this is in

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
be back now obviously this is in
single-player<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.509> no<00:01:42.720> reason<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
single-player but there's no reason that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260 
single-player but there's no reason that
it's<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.189> online<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it's not going to be in online as the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's not going to be in online as the
regular<00:01:45.750> car<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.470> some<00:01:46.590> awesome<00:01:46.710> news

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
regular car so that is some awesome news

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.469 
regular car so that is some awesome news
if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> guys<00:01:47.399> were<00:01:47.640> looking<00:01:47.820> forward<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
if you guys were looking forward to that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.880 
if you guys were looking forward to that
and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> third<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and then the third thing that I kind of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.130 
and then the third thing that I kind of
noticed<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.640> mini-map<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
noticed was that the mini-map if you

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
noticed was that the mini-map if you
look<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> picture<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> bottom<00:01:53.490> left

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
look at this picture on the bottom left

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.999 
look at this picture on the bottom left
the<00:01:54.360> mini-map<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> actually<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.799> more

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the mini-map is actually a lot more

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
the mini-map is actually a lot more
detailed<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.299> sure<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.750> me

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
detailed so I'm not sure if it's just me

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.179 
detailed so I'm not sure if it's just me
but<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.439> actually<00:01:58.590> looks<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:58.920> bit

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but it actually looks a little bit

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.840 
but it actually looks a little bit
bigger<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:01.170> kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> fades<00:02:01.860> off<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
bigger and it kind of fades off with the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
bigger and it kind of fades off with the
land<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> outer

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
land as you can see like on the outer

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530 
land as you can see like on the outer
edges<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.670> that's<00:02:05.850> definitely<00:02:06.060> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
edges so that's definitely really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.880 
edges so that's definitely really
awesome<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.560> some<00:02:07.680> little

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
awesome but that is just some little

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
awesome but that is just some little
things<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> saw<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> trailers<00:02:09.660> and
