about the you know every everybody's
talking<00:01:42.150> about<00:01:42.210> 4k<00:01:42.750> these<00:01:42.960> days<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> i<00:01:43.409> just

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
talking about 4k these days and i just

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
talking about 4k these days and i just
want<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> make<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:43.890> sort<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.579> caveat

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
want to make one sort of caveat

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
want to make one sort of caveat
asterisks<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:45.810> 4k<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.320> these<00:01:46.409> cameras<00:01:46.770> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
asterisks about 4k on these cameras is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
asterisks about 4k on these cameras is
that<00:01:47.399> yes<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.790> 4k<00:01:48.090> resolution<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that yes it's 4k resolution but

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
that yes it's 4k resolution but
something<00:01:49.530> suffers<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> frame

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
something suffers and that's the frame

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
something suffers and that's the frame
rate<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> full<00:01:52.079> 4k

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
rate yeah when you go to the full 4k

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
rate yeah when you go to the full 4k
resolution<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.250> shooting<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.149> about

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
resolution you're shooting what is about

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.840 
resolution you're shooting what is about
15<00:01:54.659> frames<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.079> second<00:01:55.470> versus<00:01:56.310> Trina<00:01:56.610> true

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
15 frames a second versus Trina true

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
15 frames a second versus Trina true
motion<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.240> 24<00:01:57.659> or<00:01:57.899> 30<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:58.710> something

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
motion of 24 or 30 so that's something

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
motion of 24 or 30 so that's something
to<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.070> aware<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.369> i've<00:01:59.670> actually<00:01:59.880> been<00:02:00.030> using

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to be aware of i've actually been using

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.410 
to be aware of i've actually been using
a<00:02:00.420> lot<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.079> i<00:02:01.439> believe<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> 2.7<00:02:03.119> k

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
a lot of the i believe it's the 2.7 k

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.209 
a lot of the i believe it's the 2.7 k
mode<00:02:03.719> yeah<00:02:04.079> which<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.350> giving<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.130> know

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
mode yeah which is giving you you know

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.039 
mode yeah which is giving you you know
higher<00:02:05.640> than<00:02:05.909> HD<00:02:06.180> resolution<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> also

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
higher than HD resolution but you also

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
higher than HD resolution but you also
get<00:02:07.229> full<00:02:07.469> frame<00:02:07.680> rate<00:02:07.829> which<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> great<00:02:08.520> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
get full frame rate which is great if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.490 
get full frame rate which is great if
you<00:02:08.759> need<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> push<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.479> things<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:10.050> reframe

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you need to push in on things or reframe

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
you need to push in on things or reframe
things<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:10.979> bit<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.819> good<00:02:12.030> mood

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
things a little bit that's a good mood

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.570 
things a little bit that's a good mood
to<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to go to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.880 
to go to
you<00:02:12.790> absolutely<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.690> essentially<00:02:14.140> crop<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
you absolutely can essentially crop the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.710 
you absolutely can essentially crop the
video<00:02:15.010> which<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.610> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.120> important

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
video which is going to be important

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.830 
video which is going to be important
because<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.650> dealing<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
because if you are dealing with a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.050 
because if you are dealing with a
oversized<00:02:19.840> image<00:02:20.230> with<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> wide<00:02:21.400> angle<00:02:21.610> it's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
oversized image with a wide angle it's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.480 
oversized image with a wide angle it's
not<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.480> typical<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.410> straight<00:02:23.890> optics<00:02:24.370> in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
not a typical to get straight optics in

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.950 
not a typical to get straight optics in
there<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:25.000> some<00:02:25.180> distortion<00:02:25.780> at<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
there or have some distortion at the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.440 
there or have some distortion at the
edges<00:02:26.110> or<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.130> ability<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.640> essentially<00:02:28.000> go

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
in and crop in post so and that image is

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.170 
in and crop in post so and that image is
actually<00:02:31.420> wide<00:02:32.380> enough<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.740> if<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.310> rotate

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
actually wide enough that if you rotate

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.880 
actually wide enough that if you rotate
the<00:02:34.210> camera<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.690> its<00:02:34.840> side<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.710> actually

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the camera on its side you can actually

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.100 
the camera on its side you can actually
you<00:02:36.460> know<00:02:36.550> still<00:02:36.850> crop<00:02:37.150> out<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.390> good<00:02:37.600> HD<00:02:37.900> image

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
you know still crop out a good HD image

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.450 
you know still crop out a good HD image
from<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.260> middle<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:38.770> some<00:02:39.010> more<00:02:39.190> top

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
from the middle and have some more top

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.460 
from the middle and have some more top
to<00:02:39.640> bottom<00:02:39.970> resolution<00:02:40.690> some<00:02:41.140> people<00:02:41.380> are

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
to bottom resolution some people are

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.980 
to bottom resolution some people are
using<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.980> shoot<00:02:42.160> architecture<00:02:43.060> or<00:02:43.300> you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
using that to shoot architecture or you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.240 
using that to shoot architecture or you
know<00:02:44.080> sporting<00:02:44.530> events<00:02:44.830> where<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.070> want

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
know sporting events where they want

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.010 
know sporting events where they want
some<00:02:45.430> flexibility<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.900> know

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
some flexibility because you know

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.410 
some flexibility because you know
typically<00:02:47.680> you're<00:02:48.190> using<00:02:48.460> these<00:02:48.700> cameras<00:02:49.210> in

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
typically you're using these cameras in

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.620 
typically you're using these cameras in
an<00:02:49.630> unmanned<00:02:50.440> or<00:02:50.800> unstaffed<00:02:51.580> situation<00:02:52.420> right

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
an unmanned or unstaffed situation right

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.850 
an unmanned or unstaffed situation right
well<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.140> other<00:02:53.230> thing<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.500> think<00:02:53.560> that's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
well the other thing I think that's

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.900 
well the other thing I think that's
important<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.280> understand<00:02:54.640> about<00:02:54.790> these

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
important to understand about these

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.300 
important to understand about these
cameras<00:02:55.360> too<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.890> controls

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
cameras too is that all of the controls

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.850 
cameras too is that all of the controls
and<00:02:57.459> buttons<00:02:57.790> are<00:02:58.060> actually<00:02:58.450> pretty<00:02:58.570> small<00:02:58.959> on

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
and buttons are actually pretty small on

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.790 
and buttons are actually pretty small on
the<00:02:59.950> side<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:00.220> have<00:03:00.459> USB<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.720> micro<00:03:01.800> HDMI

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
the side we have USB and micro HDMI

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.790 
the side we have USB and micro HDMI
