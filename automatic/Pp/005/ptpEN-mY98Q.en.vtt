and<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> adjust<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.590> speed<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
and it's going to adjust the speed of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860 
and it's going to adjust the speed of
the<00:00:44.250> fan<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.090> stoves<00:00:45.360> temperature

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the fan as the stoves temperature

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.290 
the fan as the stoves temperature
changes<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.010> stove<00:00:47.190> pizza<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:48.000> eco

changes so if your stove pizza then eco

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
changes so if your stove pizza then eco
fan<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> remove<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> blades<00:00:49.559> faster

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
fan is going to remove the blades faster

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
fan is going to remove the blades faster
and<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> stove<00:00:50.969> cools<00:00:51.270> down<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> fan<00:00:51.930> will

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and as the stove cools down the fan will

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.569 
and as the stove cools down the fan will
automatically<00:00:52.710> slow<00:00:52.860> down<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.370> eventually

Waterloo which is the leading
technological<00:01:08.220> university<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.880> Canada<00:01:09.360> these

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
technological university in Canada these

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
technological university in Canada these
tests<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.439> proven<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.950> using<00:01:11.280> an<00:01:11.520> eco<00:01:11.820> fan

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
tests have proven that using an eco fan

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.899 
tests have proven that using an eco fan
can<00:01:12.600> reduce<00:01:12.900> fuel<00:01:13.229> usage<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> 18%

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
can reduce fuel usage up to 18%

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
can reduce fuel usage up to 18%
so<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.509> savings<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so this savings is also going to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
so this savings is also going to
translate<00:01:17.369> into<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> reduction<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
translate into a reduction of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.630 
translate into a reduction of
particulate<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.110> well<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.710> carbon<00:01:20.189> emissions

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
particulate as well as carbon emissions

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
particulate as well as carbon emissions
so<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> use<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.659> Eco<00:01:22.020> fans<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.830> only<00:01:23.100> saves

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so the use of Eco fans not only saves

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
so the use of Eco fans not only saves
you<00:01:23.460> money<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.060> also<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> help

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you money but it's also going to help

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.990 
you money but it's also going to help
the<00:01:25.110> environment<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.680> well<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.729> does<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the environment as well so how does the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.580 
the environment as well so how does the
Eco<00:01:27.240> fan<00:01:27.450> work<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> wondering<00:01:28.439> even

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
Eco fan work are you wondering even

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.039 
Eco fan work are you wondering even
though<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> may<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.549> easy<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> say<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.600> magic

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
though it may be easy to say it's magic

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
though it may be easy to say it's magic
it<00:01:31.200> turns<00:01:31.380> itself<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.250> eco<00:01:32.880> fans

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
it turns itself on and off eco fans

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
it turns itself on and off eco fans
actually<00:01:33.689> use<00:01:33.930> thermo<00:01:34.320> electric<00:01:34.590> generation

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that's nice about the Eco fan is your

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.480 
that's nice about the Eco fan is your
wood<00:01:54.689> stove<00:01:54.720> may<00:01:55.110> already<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.649> blower<00:01:56.009> but

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
wood stove may already have a blower but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
wood stove may already have a blower but
if<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> power<00:01:56.880> were<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.390> yes<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.079> can

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
if the power were to go out yes you can

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.959 
if the power were to go out yes you can
still<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.950> wood<00:01:59.100> stove<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.729> fan

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
still use your wood stove but your fan

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.300 
still use your wood stove but your fan
requires<00:02:00.390> electricity<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
requires electricity so you're just

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
requires electricity so you're just
going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> radiate<00:02:03.000> heat<00:02:03.329> off<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.020> with

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
going to radiate heat off of it but with

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
going to radiate heat off of it but with
the<00:02:04.200> Eco<00:02:04.530> fan<00:02:04.740> without<00:02:05.219> any<00:02:05.460> electricity<00:02:05.969> you

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the Eco fan without any electricity you

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
the Eco fan without any electricity you
can<00:02:06.719> still<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> heat<00:02:07.439> from<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.799> wood

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
can still have the heat from your wood

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.680 
can still have the heat from your wood
stove<00:02:08.030> circulated<00:02:09.030> throughout<00:02:09.239> your<00:02:09.509> room

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
stove circulated throughout your room

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.210 
stove circulated throughout your room
even<00:02:10.470> without<00:02:10.739> electricity

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
even without electricity

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
just a little fan and again it's doing

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.090 
just a little fan and again it's doing
it<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:27.520> without<00:02:27.700> any<00:02:27.970> electricity<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.800> Eagle
