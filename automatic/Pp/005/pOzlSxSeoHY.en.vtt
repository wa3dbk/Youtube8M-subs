you just do stuff oh I'm good take spine
whatever<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> explain

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
whatever it's not so I want to explain

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
whatever it's not so I want to explain
why<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> add<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> fish

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
why you don't want to add a lot of fish

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.690 
why you don't want to add a lot of fish
birthing<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.100> gonna<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.490> too

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
birthing and I'm not gonna get too

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
birthing and I'm not gonna get too
technical<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> keep

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
technical with this I just want to keep

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
technical with this I just want to keep
it<00:01:38.070> kind<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> high<00:01:38.430> level<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> explain<00:01:39.350> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it kind of high level and explain so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.160 
it kind of high level and explain so
like<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:41.040> tank<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> built<00:01:41.899> essentially<00:01:42.899> from

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
like your tank is built essentially from

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
like your tank is built essentially from
the<00:01:43.259> beginning<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.770> has<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.820> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the beginning it has like not as much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.929 
the beginning it has like not as much
bacteria<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.979> cycle<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.520> you've<00:01:47.850> heard

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
bacteria to like cycle so you've heard

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
bacteria to like cycle so you've heard
about<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.240> cycling<00:01:48.720> tanks<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> nitrogen

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
about like cycling tanks in the nitrogen

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.780 
about like cycling tanks in the nitrogen
cycle<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.159> gonna<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:50.430> into<00:01:50.579> lab

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
cycle and I'm not gonna get into lab

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
cycle and I'm not gonna get into lab
basically<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.360> takes<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> while<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
basically it takes a while to get the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.649 
basically it takes a while to get the
bacteria<00:01:53.100> right<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> tank<00:01:54.060> okay<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
bacteria right in the tank okay so you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
bacteria right in the tank okay so you
have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.020> bacteria<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.280> when

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
have to have your bacteria right so when

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.880 
have to have your bacteria right so when
you<00:01:56.520> add<00:01:56.729> fish<00:01:57.299> you're<00:01:57.899> adding<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.500> ammonia

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you add fish you're adding more ammonia

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
you add fish you're adding more ammonia
so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.790> all<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.270> bacteria

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
so you have to have all that bacteria

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
so you have to have all that bacteria
able<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> digest<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
able to kind of digest all of that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420 
able to kind of digest all of that
ammonia<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.079> produce<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.890> cycle

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
ammonia and produce that cycle

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
ammonia and produce that cycle
converting<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> nitrite<00:02:06.869> nitrate<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.439> whole

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
converting it nitrite nitrate the whole

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.839 
converting it nitrite nitrate the whole
deal<00:02:08.179> out<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.229> figure<00:02:11.129> like

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
deal out so you have to like figure like

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.710 
deal out so you have to like figure like
if<00:02:11.970> you're<00:02:12.150> adding<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
if you're adding like

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.300 
if you're adding like
let's<00:02:12.840> say<00:02:12.930> you've<00:02:13.080> got<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.260> 30-gallon<00:02:14.040> well

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
let's say you've got a 30-gallon well

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.100 
let's say you've got a 30-gallon well
I'll<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:14.700> example<00:02:15.060> 255<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.960> can

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I'll use my example 255 and you can

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
I'll use my example 255 and you can
scale<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.470> back<00:02:16.650> whoever<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.100> want<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.760> I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
scale this back whoever you want so I

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.470 
scale this back whoever you want so I
added<00:02:18.030> like<00:02:18.300> 15<00:02:18.720> fish<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> tank<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
added like 15 fish to the tank and the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.040 
added like 15 fish to the tank and the
bacteria<00:02:22.230> wasn't<00:02:23.160> able<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.610> take<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.570> hard

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
bacteria wasn't able to take that hard

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.130 
bacteria wasn't able to take that hard
plunge<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.880> high<00:02:27.270> amounts<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.780> ammonia

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
plunge of the high amounts of ammonia

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.720 
plunge of the high amounts of ammonia
that<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.680> added<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> tank<00:02:29.460> because<00:02:29.700> it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that I just added to the tank because it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.190 
that I just added to the tank because it
wasn't<00:02:30.090> able<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.050> wasn't

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
wasn't able to like it wasn't

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.790 
wasn't able to like it wasn't
established<00:02:31.950> enough<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.400> do<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.800> so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
established enough to do that now so

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.830 
established enough to do that now so
like<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.310> had<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:35.940> killing<00:02:36.240> some<00:02:36.420> fish<00:02:36.660> here

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
like I had up killing some fish here

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.910 
like I had up killing some fish here
because<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.080> had<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.410> believe<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.830> was

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
because I had to know I believe it was

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
because I had to know I believe it was
an<00:02:38.040> ammonia<00:02:38.280> spike<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.760> actually<00:02:39.120> killed

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
an ammonia spike that actually killed

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.290 
an ammonia spike that actually killed
him<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.990> what<00:02:40.560> I'm<00:02:40.680> driving<00:02:40.920> at<00:02:41.160> here<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.430> it's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
him so what I'm driving at here is it's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.880 
him so what I'm driving at here is it's
better<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.660> go<00:02:42.780> slow<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:43.500> better<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.800> be

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
better to go slow and it's better to be

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.040 
better to go slow and it's better to be
patient<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.300> really<00:02:45.780> really

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
patient it's like it's really really

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.660 
patient it's like it's really really
just<00:02:46.230> best<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.770> add<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> few<00:02:47.130> fish<00:02:47.490> at<00:02:47.580> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
just best to just add a few fish at a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.980 
just best to just add a few fish at a
time<00:02:47.700> now<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.209> are<00:02:48.300> exceptions<00:02:48.810> with

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
time now there are exceptions with

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.120 
time now there are exceptions with
cichlids<00:02:49.350> which<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:49.709> gonna<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:50.010> into

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
cichlids which I'm not gonna get into

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.710 
cichlids which I'm not gonna get into
you<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:50.580> know<00:02:50.730> me<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.000> cichlids<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.510> got<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you all know me in cichlids I got a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.630 
you all know me in cichlids I got a
little<00:02:51.900> lie<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.350> don't<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:53.070> whatever

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
little lie I don't know with whatever

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.980 
little lie I don't know with whatever
like<00:02:53.940> sometimes<00:02:54.300> cichlids<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.690> want<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.900> add

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
like sometimes cichlids you want to add

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.540 
like sometimes cichlids you want to add
a<00:02:55.020> bunch<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.410> them<00:02:55.560> all<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.770> once<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.400> like

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
a bunch of them all at once just so like

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.250 
a bunch of them all at once just so like
there's<00:02:56.820> like<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.480> everyone<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.140> all

there's like and everyone it's all

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.630 
there's like and everyone it's all
messed<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.920> no<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.220> knows<00:02:59.370> who's<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
messed up and no one knows who's the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.540 
messed up and no one knows who's the
king<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.330> all<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.380> my<00:03:01.680> opinion<00:03:02.160> with

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
king and all that but in my opinion with

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.880 
king and all that but in my opinion with
like<00:03:02.790> tropicals<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.530> want<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.770> add

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
like tropicals you really want to add

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.260 
like tropicals you really want to add
fish<00:03:05.190> slowly<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
fish slowly and I just think it's a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.940 
fish slowly and I just think it's a
better<00:03:06.390> way<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.690> go<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:07.440> example<00:03:07.830> so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
better way to go like for example so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.680 
better way to go like for example so
like<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.220> tank<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.670> should<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.000> done<00:03:09.180> with

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
like that tank I should have done with

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.810 
like that tank I should have done with
the<00:03:09.840> neons<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.350> would<00:03:10.530> add<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.860> 2<00:03:11.100> or<00:03:11.130> 3<00:03:11.280> neons

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
the neons I would add like 2 or 3 neons

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.140 
the neons I would add like 2 or 3 neons
a<00:03:12.120> week<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:13.380> like<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.040> know<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.370> month<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:14.910> five

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.460 
weeks or whatever till I get to those 15
fish<00:03:18.150> instead<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.570> adding<00:03:18.720> them<00:03:18.959> all<00:03:19.050> once<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
fish instead of adding them all once and

fish instead of adding them all once and
that's<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.709> pain<00:03:19.950> you're<00:03:20.220> saying<00:03:20.430> oh<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:20.790> but

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
your tank kind of like catches up and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.009 
your tank kind of like catches up and
goes<00:03:23.459> with<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.880> now<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.330> beauty<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.900> is

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
goes with it now the beauty of it is

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.140

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
when you have a heavily planted tank you

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.820 
when you have a heavily planted tank you
can<00:03:27.390> get<00:03:27.660> away<00:03:27.780> with<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> little<00:03:28.350> bit<00:03:28.560> more<00:03:28.709> now

want to lean on that too much I'd rather
you<00:03:31.890> all<00:03:32.010> err<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.400> side<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.640> caution<00:03:32.880> with

you all err on the side of caution with

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.340 
you all err on the side of caution with
that<00:03:33.269> but<00:03:33.390> that's<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.750> beginner<00:03:34.019> blunder

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
that but that's just a beginner blunder

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.840 
that but that's just a beginner blunder
that<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.530> see<00:03:34.709> people<00:03:35.070> adding<00:03:35.340> fish<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
that I see people adding fish to the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.060 
that I see people adding fish to the
tank<00:03:36.060> too<00:03:36.209> quickly<00:03:36.420> also<00:03:37.110> acclimate<00:03:37.920> them

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
tank too quickly also acclimate them

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.800 
tank too quickly also acclimate them
really<00:03:38.430> really<00:03:38.670> slowly<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.239> think<00:03:39.600> that's

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
really really slowly I think that's

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.120 
really really slowly I think that's
something<00:03:40.140> that's<00:03:40.290> really<00:03:40.380> helpful<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.860> also

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
something that's really helpful it also

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.500 
something that's really helpful it also
turn<00:03:41.370> off<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.670> lights<00:03:41.880> when<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.150> put<00:03:42.299> them<00:03:42.390> in

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
turn off the lights when you put them in

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.390 
turn off the lights when you put them in
there<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.840> should<00:03:43.350> do<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> full<00:03:43.890> video<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.220> just

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
there I should do a full video in just

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.030 
there I should do a full video in just
how<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.549> acclimate<00:03:45.180> fish<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:45.750> that's<00:03:46.680> part<00:03:46.980> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
how I acclimate fish but that's part of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.979 
how I acclimate fish but that's part of
it<00:03:47.160> but<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.549> overstocking<00:03:48.299> tanks<00:03:48.870> in

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
it but just like overstocking tanks in

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.930 
it but just like overstocking tanks in
