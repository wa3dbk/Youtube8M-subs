need three steps so first step opening
up<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.949> battlefield<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.880> play<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.850> minimize

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
up your battlefield to play to minimize

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
up your battlefield to play to minimize
it<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.719> me<00:00:40.280> yeah<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> next<00:00:43.530> thing<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.829> need<00:00:44.010> to

and log into your account and keep then
minimize<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> game<00:00:52.649> next<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
minimize the game next thing to do go to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.110 
minimize the game next thing to do go to
the<00:00:54.510> open<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.379> task<00:00:55.649> manager<00:00:55.829> actually<00:00:56.430> see

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the open your task manager actually see

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.310 
the open your task manager actually see
so<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> essentially<00:00:59.399> okay<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:01.230> can

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
so this is essentially okay so what can

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
so this is essentially okay so what can
it<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:05.000> basically<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> never

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it do so basically this if you never

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.010 
it do so basically this if you never
come<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> task<00:01:08.729> manager<00:01:08.970> pressing<00:01:09.900> more

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
come in the task manager pressing more

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.469 
come in the task manager pressing more
directly<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> will<00:01:10.860> open<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.960> next

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
directly is it will open this up next

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.270 
directly is it will open this up next

find bf to excavate file next thing you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480 
find bf to excavate file next thing you
need<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.479> click<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.930> set<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.280> T

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
need to do is right click it set up in T

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.600 
need to do is right click it set up in T
see<00:01:23.939> under<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> program<00:01:24.990> pretty<00:01:25.439> hearty<00:01:25.890> set

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
your about CPUs unclick the CP you want

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.140 
your about CPUs unclick the CP you want
keep<00:01:35.850> only<00:01:36.090> CPU<00:01:36.689> 0<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.610> press<00:01:39.540> ok
