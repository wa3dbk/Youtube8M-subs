00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.490
 hi girls, how good are we going to do? 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.400
 we necklace now we are not going to 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.190
 do in these good tones this is going to be 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.130
 very very simple we are also going to 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.560
 need our crystals in this 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.760
 case I have caught three tone 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.950
 this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.560
 this 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.630
 and white these are the three tones that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.300
 I have chosen to do not now 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.340
 this necklace 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.489
 well we are going to need our 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 tool 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.990
 and we're also going to need washers 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 our closures and our washer more 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.809
 great for closing 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.000
 Well , first of all, we have to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.670
 do 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.670
 you are going to take the washer 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.820
 and exposing them by our crystals 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.050
 we have to put in all the crystals 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050
 washers 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.920
 this is heavy to do because of course 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 man is not that it takes two or 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.600
 three days 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 but since we are not going to take neither chain nor 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.159
 lace or anything we're going to be joining 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.499
 A) Yes 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.350
 we are putting on all the 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:31.150
 crystals 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.150
 our will make of league 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.789
 in some it costs more work than in 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.789
 other 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.570
 It also depends on how we open the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.570
 washer is no easier or more difficult 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.860
 but good is an easy job then you 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.820
 I will tell my model what happens to me 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.820
 the parade 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.369
 to make the photo 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.069
 they're like we opened the washer also not 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.220
 it's easier or harder, well, 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.680
 I'm going to put the washer on everything and now 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.910
 we look good because I have already put 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.910
 all washers 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.110
 and now how are we going to do good 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.349
 well, that's how the presentation will be 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.230
 let's say our necklace below 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.420
 what we have to do is catch 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.160
 washer 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.160
 we need another washer 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.620
 and we have to go together 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.299
 the crystals for example 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.299
 this with this 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.740
 next washer 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.240
 this with this 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.070
 and so we're going to go uniting everything 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.070
 you with this one 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.519
 when you go to join them you have to have 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.090
 careful so that then it does not stir 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.099
 much 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.099
 that is more well sitting 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.760
 well I'm going to keep putting good 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.540
 Well, we only have the last one and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.520
 and put our closure and you'll see what 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.520
 precious that remains 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.060
 and we've already finished girls that I 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.090
 you count 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.210
 do not tell me 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.450
 that is not precious 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.930
 it stays super cool and I've already 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.940
 seen that it is very simple very easy and 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.170
 we go in a moment makes us very necklace 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.570
 to party 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.280
 to see I wanted to comment you have to 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.020
 Be careful when buying crystals 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.110
 many times we see the crystals in the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.780
 boxes we do not notice and some do not come 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.900
 with holes to put the rings 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.940
 because they are for hitting because it has 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.720
 past that bought crystals in the form 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.920
 of beautiful flowers and then when I have 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.430
 open 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.800
 I found that we were not served 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.260
 if they serve as long as you want them 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.230
 paste that do not carry the holes so 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.650
 you have to be careful in the holes 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.970
 something else sometimes the crystals these 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.730
 well it's not crystal but I say it 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.410
 glass sometimes these Crystals 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.710
 holes do not carry them either 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.440
 finished completely because yesterday happened to me 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.360
 that I started doing and some did not happen 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.030
 because the needle was not in the hole 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.100
 done, well, I think 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.980
 that if two beautiful glass houses and 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.689
 you need the one that takes us to the hole 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.809
 simply with a needle 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.009
 hot we burn it we can go through 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:35.199
 I believe it 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.070
 as we do not need it because the truth is not 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.220
 I have done the test 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.860
 for nothing was only this 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.960
 I pass like me and nothing here 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.380
 you have the necklace 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.780
 I think it's beautiful and very cool 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.350
 let's go the same thing 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.700
 with something elegant like with jeans 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.139
 gaston or this 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:05.499
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.499
 and see you next goodbye
