00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.960
 hundred this effort there is carmelo pedraza that will not decide who 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.959
 where is the one that has to show yes yes as tomographies 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.409
 we find 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.419
 house goal 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.020
 I told him that we found a cloth rooms 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.180
 the most visited and most impressive is where they are putting you parts 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.820
 of the body or parts of the human body where the whole organ can be appreciated 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.189
 for the third live 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.409
 of 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:29.679
 are these are parts of the body that have been worked by the students of the 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.600
 second semester of medical school and I meet the doctor 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.370
 the East 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.970
 professor of anatomy and the sea 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.000
 other details about the organs as these bodies have been worked on very 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.950
 good afternoon doctor 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.780
 very good afternoon is part of the fair we work 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.719
 is presenting everything that was descriptive 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.559
 and topographic anatomy for both the presentation by Africa and the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.210
 study 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.440
 detailed of each of the morgan the top to the bottom of the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.479
 cosmopolitan 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.410
 so that all students understand understand and that way you feel 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 it seems to me if we go to the second part 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.500
 of course 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.210
 this interest is not an essential part as before 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.380
 but if it's not a topographic cut like a nuclear magnetic resonance 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.320
 in which we can perfectly well the brain 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 the entire spinal cord the spine 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.270
 then the nostrils the mouth the tongue the esophagus and ahead we can 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.560
 see the trachea 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.260
 much lower the heart and the liver and the next one is the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.280
 next let's say 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.870
 and the virtue of the work done with us we can touch it without fear of 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.090
 pollute stain that is completely isolated 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.730
 here we can find for example we can see all the particles one the 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.540
 part practically all other part of intestines 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.479
 and on this other side confirms 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.840
 Pretty explanatory before very nice to see 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.200
 all the lung the diaphragm that the muscle that separates the practical part 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 all the liver the kidney made part of the large intestine and here towards 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.090
 down in the whole part of apple and if with all these details that we 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.760
 we show the human body of the university and went crazy mosquera 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.120
 of studies thanks to carmelo scientific fair and in u turned to be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.190
 visited by students that is by the general public 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.379
 if he claimed hours
