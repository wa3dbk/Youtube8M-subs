think it's time for me to do with
another<00:00:04.620> plant<00:00:04.950> species<00:00:05.160> profile<00:00:05.730> since<00:00:06.629> it's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
another plant species profile since it's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.450 
another plant species profile since it's
been<00:00:06.990> almost<00:00:07.200> oh<00:00:07.560> no<00:00:07.770> nine<00:00:08.040> months<00:00:08.370> or

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.959 
something like that and I've only done
one<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.830> they<00:00:11.280> were<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.670> talking

one so they were going to be talking

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.530 
one so they were going to be talking
about<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.300> Amazon<00:00:12.929> sort<00:00:13.910> plant<00:00:14.910> or<00:00:15.210> some

probably announce both those names wrong

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.390 
probably announce both those names wrong
that<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> scientific<00:00:24.180> name<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that was a scientific name now this is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000 
that was a scientific name now this is
inserted<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.689> good<00:00:28.140> beginner<00:00:28.439> plant<00:00:28.650> I'm

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
inserted be very good beginner plant I'm

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.150 
inserted be very good beginner plant I'm
not<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> plant<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.910> expert<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.130> seem<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
not a plant like expert but I seem to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
not a plant like expert but I seem to
have<00:00:32.309> some<00:00:32.669> fair<00:00:33.000> success<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.510> bigger

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
have some fair success with bigger

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.549 
have some fair success with bigger
implants<00:00:34.170> now<00:00:34.890> Shannon<00:00:35.280> Doris<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.760> Larry<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
implants now Shannon Doris but Larry is

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
implants now Shannon Doris but Larry is
fairly<00:00:37.559> popular<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.300> easily<00:00:39.809> available

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
fairly popular and it's easily available

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959 
fairly popular and it's easily available
so<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> good<00:00:41.250> starter<00:00:41.579> plant<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so it's a good starter plant for a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
so it's a good starter plant for a
couple<00:00:42.180> reasons<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.260> doesn't<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
couple reasons one it doesn't have that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.069 
couple reasons one it doesn't have that
high<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> light<00:00:44.160> requirement<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:45.750> grew<00:00:45.960> in

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
high of a light requirement it grew in

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.319 
high of a light requirement it grew in
low<00:00:46.200> light<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.680> grows<00:00:47.039> best<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.640> medium<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
low light but grows best in medium to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.580 
low light but grows best in medium to
bright<00:00:48.510> light<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.110> it'll<00:00:49.289> grow<00:00:49.379> bigger

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
bright light because it'll grow bigger

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.330 
bright light because it'll grow bigger
of<00:00:49.770> course<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:51.860> another<00:00:52.860> thing<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> reason

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of course and another thing the reason

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.470 
of course and another thing the reason
why<00:00:53.520> people<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.789> keep<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> plan<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
why people like keep this plan is that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
why people like keep this plan is that
saw<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.440> tell<00:00:55.739> obviously<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
saw I think tell obviously here if you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.849 
saw I think tell obviously here if you
look<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.910> hand<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:58.050> hand<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> seven<00:00:58.649> inches

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
look at my hand my hand is seven inches

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
look at my hand my hand is seven inches
long<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.760> look<00:00:59.969> how<00:01:00.090> wide<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.359> plant

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
long and they look how wide that plant

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
long and they look how wide that plant
is<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.859> plant<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.219> further<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.789> it's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
is and the plant is further back so it's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
is and the plant is further back so it's
actually<00:01:03.180> bigger<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.719> looks<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.619> these

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
actually bigger and it looks so these

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
actually bigger and it looks so these
things<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.939> grow<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.990> eighteen

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
things they can grow to up to eighteen

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
things they can grow to up to eighteen
inches<00:01:07.439> tall<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.640> sometimes<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.299> feet<00:01:09.510> wide

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
inches tall and sometimes two feet wide

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.359 
inches tall and sometimes two feet wide
mine's<00:01:10.590> approaching<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> size<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
mine's approaching that size so

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.770 
mine's approaching that size so
basically<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.030> plant<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.630> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
basically this is one plant that if you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590 
basically this is one plant that if you
are<00:01:15.930> starting<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.850> aquarium<00:01:18.330> hobby

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
are starting up in your aquarium hobby

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330 
are starting up in your aquarium hobby
and<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:18.930> wanna<00:01:19.229> start<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.470> plants<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and they wanna start with plants if you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
and they wanna start with plants if you
have<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> 20<00:01:20.790> gallon<00:01:20.880> tank<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> 20<00:01:21.900> gallon

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have a 20 gallon tank like a 20 gallon

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
have a 20 gallon tank like a 20 gallon
high<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.439> something<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.700> this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
high or something like that you put this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
high or something like that you put this
in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> center<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.630> they'll<00:01:24.810> fill<00:01:25.020> out

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
in the center of it and they'll fill out

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
in the center of it and they'll fill out
the<00:01:25.320> tank<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.689> now<00:01:27.689> um<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:29.189> stay

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the tank for you all now um as I stay

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
the tank for you all now um as I stay
the<00:01:30.150> light<00:01:30.299> requirements<00:01:30.479> aren't<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.049> high

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the light requirements aren't very high

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
the light requirements aren't very high
the<00:01:31.979> nutrient<00:01:32.549> requirements<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> high

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the nutrient requirements are the high

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060 
the nutrient requirements are the high
either<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.840> lower<00:01:34.290> nutrient<00:01:34.740> water<00:01:34.890> will

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
either but lower nutrient water will

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
either but lower nutrient water will
produce<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> smaller<00:01:35.490> plants<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.110> is

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
produce the smaller plants this one is

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
produce the smaller plants this one is
growing<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.560> soil<00:01:37.770> pot<00:01:38.090> well<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.240> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
growing at soil pot well actually I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.450 
growing at soil pot well actually I
think<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.930> might<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.500> well<00:01:40.860> used<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.250> one

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
think this might be well used to be one

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.740 
think this might be well used to be one
plant<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:41.939> starting<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> split<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> two

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
plant but starting to split the two

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.139 
plant but starting to split the two
plants<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> root<00:01:44.520> Basin<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.060> as

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
plants down at the root Basin here as

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.280 
plants down at the root Basin here as
you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.270> tell<00:01:45.390> threaten<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.229> than

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you can tell threaten to get more than

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.649 
you can tell threaten to get more than
one<00:01:46.409> crown<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.729> plant<00:01:48.030> up

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
one crown but this was one plant up

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.160 
one crown but this was one plant up
until<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> few<00:01:49.049> months<00:01:49.290> ago<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
until a few months ago so this one is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260 
until a few months ago so this one is
growing<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.590> soil<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> plant

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
growing in soil it you know the plant

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
growing in soil it you know the plant
pot<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.750> um<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.100> would<00:01:56.250> provide<00:01:56.430> extra

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
pot so um this one would provide extra

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.889 
pot so um this one would provide extra
nutrients<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.689> grow

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
nutrients for it so it would grow

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.469 
nutrients for it so it would grow
slightly<00:01:58.229> faster<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.969> doesn't<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.299> have

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
slightly faster it doesn't really have

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.780 
slightly faster it doesn't really have
that<00:02:00.630> wall<00:02:00.780> developing<00:02:01.170> root<00:02:01.409> system<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that wall developing root system so I

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
that wall developing root system so I
assume<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.810> big<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> nutrient

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
assume it's not that big of a nutrient

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.050 
assume it's not that big of a nutrient
hard<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
hard just because of that if it was a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.160 
hard just because of that if it was a
nutrient<00:02:06.450> hog<00:02:06.570> heaven

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
nutrient hog heaven

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.249

it<00:02:13.950> grows<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.459> stalks<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.660> actually

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it grows these stalks you can actually

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
it grows these stalks you can actually
see<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.990> stock<00:02:16.230> right<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.459> stalk

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
see a stock right here on that stalk

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
see a stock right here on that stalk
these<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.720> plantlets<00:02:19.050> grow<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
these little plantlets grow and the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.600 
these little plantlets grow and the
plantlets<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.090> stock<00:02:21.360> grew<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:22.550> probably<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
plantlets the stock grew in probably a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.490 
plantlets the stock grew in probably a
few<00:02:24.030> weeks<00:02:24.180> before<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.510> go<00:02:24.630> home<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.110> it's

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
few weeks before I go home and it's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.110 
few weeks before I go home and it's
starting<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> grow<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.280> plantlets<00:02:26.910> on

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
starting to grow a little plantlets on

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
starting to grow a little plantlets on
it<00:02:27.240> but<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.560> don't<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.100> know<00:02:29.220> how<00:02:29.340> long<00:02:29.459> it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
it but I don't you know how long it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.420 
it but I don't you know how long it
takes<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.090> planets<00:02:30.480> develop<00:02:31.220> now<00:02:32.220> with

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
takes for the planets develop now with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
takes for the planets develop now with
the<00:02:32.490> plantlets<00:02:32.820> yes<00:02:33.060> let<00:02:33.239> them<00:02:33.330> stay<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.510> there

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the plantlets yes let them stay on there

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.240 
the plantlets yes let them stay on there
until<00:02:34.080> they<00:02:34.200> basically<00:02:34.470> come<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.770> little<00:02:35.070> mini

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
until they basically come a little mini

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.400 
until they basically come a little mini
plants<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:36.630> break<00:02:36.840> them<00:02:37.020> off<00:02:37.140> or

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
plants and you can you break them off or

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.479 
plants and you can you break them off or
bare<00:02:37.709> off<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:37.980> letting<00:02:38.130> break<00:02:38.340> off

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
bare off just letting break off

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.120 
bare off just letting break off
naturally<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:39.390> route<00:02:39.720> them<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
naturally you can then route them and I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.590 
naturally you can then route them and I
can<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.370> another<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:42.120> actually<00:02:42.360> have

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
can have another one I actually have

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.620 
can have another one I actually have
another<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.500> one<00:02:43.950> sorting<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:45.330> behind

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
another and one sorting here it's behind

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.259 
another and one sorting here it's behind
this<00:02:45.900> melon<00:02:46.680> sword<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.640> kinda<00:02:47.850> hard<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.030> see

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
this melon sword it's kinda hard to see

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.810 
this melon sword it's kinda hard to see
but<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.290> smaller<00:02:49.590> plant<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.519> in

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
but this is a smaller plant that was in

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.250 
but this is a smaller plant that was in
with<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.150> big<00:02:51.390> plant<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.989> was<00:02:52.080> being

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
with this big plant and it was being

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.870 
with this big plant and it was being
shamed<00:02:52.680> by<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.100> was<00:02:53.190> being<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.550> served

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
shamed by it and was being like served

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.780 
shamed by it and was being like served
now<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> one<00:02:55.350> fault<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.519> plant

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
now this is the one fault of this plant

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.790 
now this is the one fault of this plant
is<00:02:56.940> because<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.570> big<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.470> could<00:02:58.590> end<00:02:58.739> up

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
is because it's so big it could end up

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.290 
is because it's so big it could end up
being<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.100> light<00:02:59.280> consumer<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> they<00:03:00.150> can

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
being a light consumer and they can

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.970 
being a light consumer and they can
probably<00:03:00.720> easily<00:03:00.870> out-compete<00:03:01.320> your<00:03:01.560> stem

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
probably easily out-compete your stem

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.449 
probably easily out-compete your stem
