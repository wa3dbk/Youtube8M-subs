00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
up in the trees here but uh I got a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.610 
up in the trees here but uh I got a
closer<00:04:26.030> look<00:04:26.270> at<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.480> bear<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.169> decided

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
closer look at that bear and decided

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.770 
closer look at that bear and decided
that<00:04:27.770> uh<00:04:27.880> not<00:04:28.880> quite<00:04:29.030> what<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.240> came<00:04:29.330> here<00:04:29.510> to

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
that uh not quite what I came here to

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.379 
that uh not quite what I came here to
look<00:04:29.870> forward<00:04:30.169> I<00:04:30.880> robbed<00:04:31.880> on<00:04:32.030> his<00:04:32.150> back<00:04:32.360> a

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
look forward I robbed on his back a

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.350 
look forward I robbed on his back a
little<00:04:32.630> bit<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:34.130> was<00:04:34.730> gonna<00:04:34.910> shoot<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.180> bear

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
little bit and I was gonna shoot a bear

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.000 
little bit and I was gonna shoot a bear
that<00:04:35.389> size<00:04:35.720> I'd<00:04:35.900> hope<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.230> would<00:04:36.320> be<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.470> perfect

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
that size I'd hope it would be a perfect

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.190 
that size I'd hope it would be a perfect
coat<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:38.180> bear<00:04:38.419> lived<00:04:38.690> for<00:04:38.840> another<00:04:39.020> day<00:04:39.169> and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
coat this bear lived for another day and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.510 
coat this bear lived for another day and
hopefully<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> couple<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:40.010> years<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.310> can<00:04:40.340> come

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
hopefully a couple of years you can come

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.680 
hopefully a couple of years you can come
back<00:04:40.639> and<00:04:40.820> harvest<00:04:41.120> them<00:04:41.240> when<00:04:41.270> he's<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.510> little

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
back and harvest them when he's a little

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.110 
back and harvest them when he's a little
more<00:04:41.810> mature
