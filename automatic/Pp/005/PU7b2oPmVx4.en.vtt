00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.480
 good the second day of preseason 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.730
 First of all, ask how you 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.570
 you found the group in general well 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.240
 I found myself very well really very 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.150
 glad the first group that came very 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.160
 well better than in January of last year 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.439
 we know them better both Carlos and I 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.850
 the coaching staff they know us and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.490
 they also came with a benefit 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.370
 better physics obviously came with 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.470
 good predisposition 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.290
 because there is a degree of professionalism 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.870
 important and really gratified by 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.180
 the response of a scale of 1 to 10 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.040
 as in contrast to the players 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.990
 we know that he comes from vacation that 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 obviously there are some allowed 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.450
 the normal life of all people 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.660
 Look well you could say between 7 or 8 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.640
 points are found what is like a 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.210
 continuity of work more than going back to 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.010
 start 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.470
 yes yes a continuity of work because 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.030
 although they have stopped pretty much four 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.070
 weeks 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.360
 and we have to contemplate the best that 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.220
 they could have trips or 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.710
 inactivity some went to winter 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.720
 others traveled a lot others maybe 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.460
 they were on the beach but you have to go 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.110
 working with caution the first days 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.800
 see how they assimilate the works 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.210
 strong how they respond and treat 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.159
 next week to empower them 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.479
 working more intensively with more 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.880
 of plans are preseason has 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.790
 some difference with what happened that is 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.490
 look what comes planned working 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.440
 from knowing the players 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.000
 making diagnoses already on the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.280
 security and the certainties that we have 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.600
 together with the medical body of the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.060
 possibilities of the players the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.009
 clinical history of the players 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.990
 different injuries or not that have 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.929
 had them knowing the new ones that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.330
 can come and adapt but everything 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.190
 obviously study more fluid faster 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.619
 because the coaching staff and the players 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.420
 we know each other know the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.330
 ways of working know the types of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.039
 work then there is work 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.080
 everything flows much better than a year ago 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.179
 to do double shifts every day to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.330
 the morning today they also had to go to the 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.800
 very intense ecological reserve work 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.890
 how are they responding, although they are two 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.900
 days and how you diagram each day if you already 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.310
 they have it pre-established or they see it 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.500
 also according to the weather you have to see 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.200
 different variants look there's a 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.970
 planning here until Sunday 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.030
 next before until the match by 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.370
 students there is a planning 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.630
 obviously always in all 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.240
 schedules have to suffer 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.070
 adjustments and modifications first on base 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.900
 to the second climate based on logistics 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.490
 based on the people that we can 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 find somewhere that we go out 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.510
 of the club and based on adaptations 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.730
 with the boys if maybe 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.740
 small imponderables arise as a 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.630
 player who may have a blister a 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.250
 little fatigue or a little pain or a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 hit the planning you have to go 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.410
 moving it according to that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.080
 and you have to know how to adapt with 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.780
 flexibility to all jobs for 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.060
 that everything can be done more mechanically if 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.530
 I talk about specific work so that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.110
 make a needs of each player 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.540
 just mentioned also something that is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.630
 projected for the whole year or only for 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.069
 the preseason not during all the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.540
 season you have to be attentive to each 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.550
 boys trying to be the most 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.380
 possible individual with the help of 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.030
 Medical body customize work 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.040
 both in empowerment and 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.530
 prevention prevention work 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.360
 because we know that it came long this time 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.239
 the list of injured perhaps in all the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.239
 year was the biggest problem that harassed 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.610
 deals with how it is prevented in the face of what 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.030
 comes looks trying to do the most 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.110
 possible in terms of strengthening 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 prevention exercises together with the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.730
 Medical body trying to customize 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.230
 the work trying to create greater 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.150
 professional conscience always in the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.400
 player trying to work the part 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.319
 technique being very attentive because to 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.230
 Sometimes the player wants to make the player 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.600
 wants to play and that the load in some 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.730
 football moment I can not 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.110
 betrays the player who is in 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.300
 detriment instead of being a benefit 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.910
 then there are several aspects that 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.890
 we have to be alert 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.020
 technical body medical body and players 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.120
 we are also all have to be 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.190
 Attentive everyone if there is something 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.800
 detected from last year's respect that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.570
 they have to be with the objective set 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.420
 in that or something that has to change for 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.780
 that the lesions are not looking 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.880
 multifactorial as I just said 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.380
 We try to take care of as much 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.450
 aspects so that they are all under 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.830
 control but in reality not only in 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.020
 soccer in any area in any 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.520
 company in any enterprise 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.630
 there are always imponderables and have everything 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.270
 under control in life is impossible 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.100
 in the in any area in the in the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.490
 street and more in the country where we live in 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.490
 the traffic 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.509
 trying to contemplate as I said 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.759
 before aspects rests food 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.430
 nutrition the fuel that 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.669
 players get the recovery that 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.740
 have they would be reiteratively prevent 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.030
 with the medical body to exercise 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.030
 prevention evaluate them 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.470
 but detect one when a multi 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.710
 number of factors that have attempted 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.500
 can not be detected because if not yes 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.540
 was really the cause would not happen 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.410
 nothing to any team to see the improvements 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.880
 that were happening in the 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.950
 club facilities also yesterday 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.530
 we saw a dining room where the players go 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.200
 to lunch with nutritionists also a 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.790
 where they will be able to relax look 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.940
 helps sum helps and gives great contributions to 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.650
 team we have in mind that we are in 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.510
 the best club in Argentina and 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.050
 I personally think that I would like 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.940
 say we have all the logistics and 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.040
 all means on the part of the club like 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.500
 to do the best always from the 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.320
 2008 that I was able to learn and see 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.320
 this and now more is a super club 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.180
 professional at European level with a large 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.360
 infrastructure and a large structure 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.500
 that supports the coaching staff as to 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.480
 that the coaching staff have all the 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.919
 means available for the first 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.740
 equipment and also for the inferior 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.230
 then always the club is in 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.700
 Adding position of contributing and giving 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.050
 all the means that are needed and 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.940
 are available to the team and 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.370
 talking about some particular cases 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.290
 riquelme and gago how are we do not know what 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.600
 is working apart then he does it with 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.560
 the well-fernando group is assimilating 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.669
 well all the works trying to 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.030
 add a preseason that he did not 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.430
 A long time ago and Roman training 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.660
 differentiated but surely the part 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.870
 of the medical body is going to indicate you better 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.870
 that I 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.729
 that he had many lands without a castle and 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.729
 also a love
