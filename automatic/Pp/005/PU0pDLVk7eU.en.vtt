the blade length is three and a half

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
the blade length is three and a half
inches<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> overall<00:01:29.159> length<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.020> 8.2

standard<00:01:34.920> size<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.430> ZT<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.869> my

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
standard size for a ZT I think in my

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.280 
standard size for a ZT I think in my
opinion<00:01:37.520> my<00:01:38.520> humble<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.659> always<00:01:39.930> correct

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
opinion I like the way it feels in the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.910 
opinion I like the way it feels in the
hand<00:01:44.299> just<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> feeling<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.619> here

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
hand just kind of feeling it out here

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.920 
hand just kind of feeling it out here
and<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.790> first<00:01:48.060> look<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> too<00:01:48.689> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and this is my first look at it too so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.240 
and this is my first look at it too so
if<00:01:49.049> some<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> information<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.040> wrong

if some of the information is wrong

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
if some of the information is wrong
don't<00:01:51.060> blame<00:01:51.390> me<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.939> suspect<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:54.659> just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
don't blame me and I I suspect I'm just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.810 
don't blame me and I I suspect I'm just
feeling<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.560> very<00:01:55.829> tight<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
feeling it this one is very tight like I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.639 
feeling it this one is very tight like I
said<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> prototype<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.930> once<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.439> is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
said it's a prototype but once that is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.109 
said it's a prototype but once that is
in<00:01:59.640> full<00:02:00.390> force<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.439> production<00:02:01.740> version

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
in full force in the production version

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.780 
in full force in the production version
and<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.630> very<00:02:03.960> very<00:02:04.200> smooth

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
and that is going to be very very smooth
