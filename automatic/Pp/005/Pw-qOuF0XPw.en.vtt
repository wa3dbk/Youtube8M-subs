00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
not that skilled or talented yet or good

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.850 
not that skilled or talented yet or good
I<00:01:33.540> guess<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.020> say<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> run<00:01:34.680> for

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
I guess you can say this is the run for

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
I guess you can say this is the run for
you<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.909> falling<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.420> right

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you but as you're falling off right

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
you but as you're falling off right
there<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.710> did<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> 540<00:01:38.250> spin<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
there you see he just did a 540 spin and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.670 
there you see he just did a 540 spin and
landed<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> manual<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.350> tricks

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
landed in the manual do not do tricks

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100 
landed in the manual do not do tricks
because<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.939> count<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.899> when

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
because it's not gonna count so when

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
because it's not gonna count so when
you're<00:01:43.229> falling<00:01:43.439> down<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.280> any<00:01:44.490> tricks

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you're falling down do not do any tricks

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.310 
you're falling down do not do any tricks
I<00:01:44.939> repeat<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.600> any<00:01:45.750> tricks<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.110> would

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
I repeat do not do any tricks or would

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
I repeat do not do any tricks or would
not<00:01:46.439> count<00:01:46.740> alright<00:01:47.549> guys<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:47.880> literally

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
not count alright guys so just literally

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.389 
not count alright guys so just literally
just<00:01:48.540> freefall<00:01:49.049> until<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.799> land<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> menu

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
just freefall until you land in a menu

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.830 
just freefall until you land in a menu
and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.149> start<00:01:51.329> doing<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.689> code

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and then you can start doing the code

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
and then you can start doing the code
reverts<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.530> don't<00:01:53.009> really<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.579> ask

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
reverts or I don't really think you ask

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
reverts or I don't really think you ask
you<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.000> reverse<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.439> just

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you to go reverse for that one but just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.749 
you to go reverse for that one but just
basically<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.100> landing<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> manual

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
basically just landing the manual

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.929 
basically just landing the manual
component<00:01:57.329> clean<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:58.460> that's<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.790> for

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
component clean but that's really it for

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.399 
component clean but that's really it for
drainage<00:02:00.270> dish<00:02:00.450> guys<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.049> wasn't<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
drainage dish guys it wasn't that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.700 
drainage dish guys it wasn't that
complicated<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:04.079> basically<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
complicated to do is just basically you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
complicated to do is just basically you
needs<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.100> how<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.430> Schriever<00:02:05.850> for

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
needs to know how to go Schriever for

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.570 
needs to know how to go Schriever for
this<00:02:06.270> map<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.590> next<00:02:07.740> map<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.950> gonna<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.340> Q

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this map so the next map is gonna be Q

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.130 
this map so the next map is gonna be Q
Bowl<00:02:08.819> q<00:02:09.720> bo<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.679> gonna<00:02:10.800> be<00:02:10.890> too

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
Bowl q bo is actually gonna be too

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.809 
Bowl q bo is actually gonna be too
different<00:02:12.560> runs<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.250> map<00:02:13.460> is<00:02:13.670> gonna

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
different runs for this map is gonna

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.340 
different runs for this map is gonna
need<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.030> vert<00:02:14.210> run<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.660> dark<00:02:14.810> caching<00:02:15.170> map

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
need a vert run in the dark caching map

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.850 
need a vert run in the dark caching map
or<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.620> dark<00:02:15.980> caching<00:02:16.280> run<00:02:16.459> excuse<00:02:16.760> me<00:02:16.880> and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
or the dark caching run excuse me and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.380 
or the dark caching run excuse me and
again<00:02:18.860> all<00:02:19.130> these<00:02:19.280> clips<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> team<00:02:19.970> order

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
description below um but anyways let's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.810 
description below um but anyways let's
get<00:02:26.600> started<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.319> dark<00:02:27.620> caching<00:02:28.069> yeah<00:02:28.790> I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
get started with the dark caching yeah I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.540 
get started with the dark caching yeah I
believe<00:02:28.940> dark<00:02:29.300> caching<00:02:29.600> runs<00:02:29.780> first<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.040> again

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
believe dark caching runs first so again

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.610 
believe dark caching runs first so again
the<00:02:32.060> dark<00:02:32.240> caching<00:02:32.570> run<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.230> hard<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
the dark caching run is not that hard to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.530 
the dark caching run is not that hard to
do<00:02:33.860> if<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.130> know<00:02:34.250> how<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.430> basically<00:02:35.360> dark

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
do if you know how to basically dark

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.150 
do if you know how to basically dark
catch<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.530> only<00:02:36.709> thing<00:02:36.830> yet<00:02:36.950> you're<00:02:37.070> gonna

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
catch the only thing yet you're gonna

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.650 
catch the only thing yet you're gonna
have<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.580> right<00:02:37.850> here<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.150> when<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.420> start

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
have to do right here and when you start

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.960 
have to do right here and when you start
off<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.050> off<00:02:39.170> your<00:02:39.200> board<00:02:39.500> run<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.580> jump

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
off is get off your board run and jump

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.940 
off is get off your board run and jump
down<00:02:41.180> as<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:41.870> many<00:02:42.050> spins<00:02:42.319> as<00:02:42.470> many<00:02:42.709> late

down as we do as many spins as many late

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.010 
down as we do as many spins as many late
flips<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:43.459> want<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.690> simple

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that 20 seconds now you can hit a really

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.410 
that 20 seconds now you can hit a really
high<00:02:52.130> score<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.459> believe<00:02:52.700> mr.<00:02:52.970> Phi's<00:02:53.090> holding

high score I believe mr. Phi's holding

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.910 
high score I believe mr. Phi's holding
the<00:02:53.480> record<00:02:53.600> right<00:02:53.900> now<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.500> high<00:02:54.620> score

that's it for that map now the next map
is<00:04:13.160> going<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.640> be<00:04:14.260> Rosalita<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.380> believe<00:04:15.680> is

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
is going to be Rosalita I believe is

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.340 
is going to be Rosalita I believe is
called<00:04:15.920> um<00:04:16.370> it's<00:04:17.150> located<00:04:17.690> right<00:04:17.989> here<00:04:18.049> on

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
called um it's located right here on

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.620 
called um it's located right here on
challenge<00:04:19.010> map<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.090> left

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
challenge map and so I left

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.720 
challenge map and so I left
to<00:04:20.900> Mount<00:04:21.080> but<00:04:21.800> it's<00:04:22.040> got<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> spot<00:04:22.340> I'll<00:04:22.520> go<00:04:22.670> to

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
to Mount but it's got a spot I'll go to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.110 
to Mount but it's got a spot I'll go to
roaches<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.480> go<00:04:23.570> down<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.750> Rosalita<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:25.120> this

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
roaches and go down to Rosalita and this

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.110 
roaches and go down to Rosalita and this
map<00:04:26.360> has<00:04:26.810> basically<00:04:27.620> three<00:04:27.740> runs<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.940> third

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
map has basically three runs the third

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.910 
map has basically three runs the third
run<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.510> not<00:04:29.660> really<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.200> much<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.740> a

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
run is not really that much of a

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.710 
run is not really that much of a
difference<00:04:31.070> well<00:04:31.730> there<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.000> four<00:04:32.240> runs<00:04:32.270> but

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
difference well there is four runs but

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.650 
difference well there is four runs but
anyways<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.950> one<00:04:34.100> push<00:04:34.310> run<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.150> push<00:04:35.390> run

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
anyways is of one push run a to push run

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.780 
anyways is of one push run a to push run
to<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> right<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.100> won't<00:04:37.310> there's<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.640> one

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
to the right and it won't there's a one

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.300 
to the right and it won't there's a one
push<00:04:38.000> run<00:04:38.180> in<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.540> push<00:04:38.720> run<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.410> left<00:04:39.650> so

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
push run in to push run to the left so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.500 
push run in to push run to the left so
you<00:04:40.340> get<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.580> pick<00:04:40.700> whatever<00:04:40.850> way<00:04:41.150> you<00:04:41.210> want

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
you get to pick whatever way you want

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.600 
you get to pick whatever way you want
and<00:04:41.750> basically<00:04:42.650> when<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:42.920> stamina<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.340> start

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
and basically when you stamina you start

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.190 
and basically when you stamina you start
off<00:04:43.730> is<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.030> take<00:04:44.210> one<00:04:44.390> push<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.660> go<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.020> the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
off is you take one push and go to the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.290 
off is you take one push and go to the
right<00:04:45.350> go<00:04:45.680> all<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.370> way<00:04:46.400> down<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.850> end<00:04:47.000> up

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
right go all the way down to the end up

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.550 
right go all the way down to the end up
to<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.540> see<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.870> little<00:04:48.050> ramp<00:04:48.320> right<00:04:48.530> here

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
to you see this little ramp right here

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.160 
to you see this little ramp right here
use<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.610> turn<00:04:49.760> around<00:04:49.940> or<00:04:50.390> just<00:04:50.480> use<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.080> to

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
use it to turn around or just use it to

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.060 
use it to turn around or just use it to
trick<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.400> get<00:04:52.550> more<00:04:52.730> points<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:54.070> what

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
trick on and to get more points and what

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.650 
trick on and to get more points and what
he<00:04:55.190> does<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.610> just<00:04:55.820> use<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.270> turn<00:04:56.390> around

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
he does is just use it to turn around

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.600 
he does is just use it to turn around
and<00:04:56.750> get<00:04:56.810> more<00:04:56.990> speed<00:04:57.230> and<00:04:57.710> again<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:58.520> could

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
and get more speed and again you could

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.130 
and get more speed and again you could
keep<00:04:58.850> going<00:04:58.910> wherever<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.420> want<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.870> your

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
keep going wherever you want and your

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.560 
keep going wherever you want and your
Olga<00:05:00.440> score<00:05:00.710> will<00:05:00.890> count<00:05:01.160> up<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.460> add<00:05:01.700> up<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.540> a

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
Olga score will count up and add up to a

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.420 
Olga score will count up and add up to a
really<00:05:02.870> high<00:05:02.990> score<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.530> again<00:05:03.800> I<00:05:03.980> believe<00:05:04.070> he

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
really high score and again I believe he

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.890 
really high score and again I believe he
holds<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.820> record<00:05:05.090> for<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.360> map<00:05:05.510> not<00:05:05.780> too

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
holds the record for this map not too

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.660 
holds the record for this map not too
short<00:05:06.170> go<00:05:06.770> check<00:05:06.980> it<00:05:07.100> out<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.220> was<00:05:07.340> thinking

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
short go check it out I was thinking

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.970 
short go check it out I was thinking
channel<00:05:07.970> like<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.180> said<00:05:08.450> before<00:05:08.770> but<00:05:09.770> the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
channel like I said before but the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.770 
channel like I said before but the
second<00:05:10.340> run<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.670> gonna<00:05:10.850> be<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.270> push<00:05:11.480> run

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
second run is gonna be the to push run

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.110 
second run is gonna be the to push run
now<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:13.070> push<00:05:13.250> run<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.580> course<00:05:13.760> gets<00:05:14.000> you

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
now the to push run of course gets you

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.390 
now the to push run of course gets you
more<00:05:14.300> speed<00:05:14.630> in<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.930> beginning<00:05:15.350> but<00:05:16.070> if<00:05:16.310> you

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
more speed in the beginning but if you

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.590 
more speed in the beginning but if you
don't<00:05:16.610> need<00:05:16.760> that<00:05:16.850> money<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.300> you<00:05:17.360> don't<00:05:17.450> need

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
don't need that money if you don't need

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.820 
don't need that money if you don't need
that<00:05:17.660> much<00:05:17.840> speed<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.320> if<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:18.500> feel<00:05:18.710> like

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
that much speed and if you feel like

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.560 
that much speed and if you feel like
you're<00:05:19.010> doing<00:05:19.250> good<00:05:19.400> then<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.060> only<00:05:20.180> do<00:05:20.330> two<00:05:20.420> one

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
you're doing good then I only do two one

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.270 
you're doing good then I only do two one
push<00:05:20.750> run<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.260> get<00:05:21.590> used<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.860> doing<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.160> one

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
push run and get used to doing the one

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.270 
push run and get used to doing the one
push<00:05:22.430> runs<00:05:22.670> but<00:05:23.600> anyways<00:05:24.230> the<00:05:24.410> to<00:05:24.560> push<00:05:24.740> run<00:05:24.980> is

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
push runs but anyways the to push run is

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.920 
push runs but anyways the to push run is
basically<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.060> same<00:05:26.210> exact<00:05:26.540> thing<00:05:26.720> as<00:05:26.840> the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
basically the same exact thing as the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.780 
basically the same exact thing as the
one<00:05:27.080> push<00:05:27.260> run<00:05:27.470> you're<00:05:28.040> going<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.340> same<00:05:28.520> exact

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
one push run you're going the same exact

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.190 
one push run you're going the same exact
way<00:05:29.000> you're<00:05:29.270> going<00:05:29.480> there's<00:05:29.810> nothing<00:05:30.080> really

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
different all we're doing is getting oh

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.610 
different all we're doing is getting oh
wait<00:05:32.120> this<00:05:32.210> is<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.450> hop-on<00:05:32.780> run<00:05:32.990> excuse<00:05:33.290> me<00:05:33.470> so

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
wait this is the hop-on run excuse me so

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.600 
wait this is the hop-on run excuse me so
you<00:05:33.710> get<00:05:33.860> off<00:05:33.920> your<00:05:34.040> board<00:05:34.220> you're<00:05:34.340> running

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
you get off your board you're running

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.670 
you get off your board you're running
hop<00:05:34.760> on<00:05:35.000> can<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.660> just<00:05:35.780> continue<00:05:36.260> on<00:05:36.290> your<00:05:36.500> run

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
hop on can you just continue on your run

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.060 
hop on can you just continue on your run
um<00:05:37.660> I'm<00:05:38.660> not<00:05:38.810> too<00:05:38.870> sure<00:05:39.170> about<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.860> push

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
um I'm not too sure about the to push

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.370 
um I'm not too sure about the to push
run<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.280> believe<00:05:40.370> you<00:05:40.730> can<00:05:40.940> do<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.300> push<00:05:41.510> run<00:05:41.720> but

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
run I believe you can do to push run but

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.810 
run I believe you can do to push run but
that's<00:05:42.770> just<00:05:42.950> beside<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.340> point<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.640> same

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
that's just beside the point the same

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.130 
that's just beside the point the same
exact<00:05:44.120> thing<00:05:44.270> as<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.480> one<00:05:44.600> push<00:05:44.780> run<00:05:44.960> would

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
exact thing as the one push run would

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.900 
exact thing as the one push run would
take<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.410> two<00:05:45.560> pushes<00:05:45.950> but<00:05:46.610> this<00:05:46.730> is<00:05:46.850> the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
take the two pushes but this is the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.940 
take the two pushes but this is the
hop-on<00:05:47.240> run<00:05:47.510> again<00:05:47.960> as<00:05:48.170> you<00:05:48.320> can<00:05:48.440> see<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:48.800> got

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
hop-on run again as you can see you got

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.220 
hop-on run again as you can see you got
way<00:05:49.070> more<00:05:49.100> speed<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.360> end<00:05:50.600> up<00:05:50.750> he<00:05:51.020> ended

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
way more speed and you end up he ended

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.810 
way more speed and you end up he ended
up<00:05:51.320> going<00:05:51.500> real<00:05:51.740> clean<00:05:52.010> going<00:05:52.370> straight<00:05:52.580> ahead

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
up going real clean going straight ahead

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.970 
up going real clean going straight ahead
and<00:05:53.000> he<00:05:53.570> got<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:53.720> higher<00:05:53.870> score<00:05:54.170> than<00:05:54.230> one<00:05:54.800> push

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
and he got a higher score than one push

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.379 
and he got a higher score than one push
run<00:05:55.190> which<00:05:56.030> is<00:05:56.480> the<00:05:57.050> same<00:05:57.260> exact<00:05:57.590> thing<00:05:57.650> but

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
run which is the same exact thing but

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.480 
run which is the same exact thing but
depending<00:05:59.289> on<00:05:59.379> how<00:05:59.530> keen<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.099> each<00:06:00.430> of

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
depending on how keen you and each of

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.420 
depending on how keen you and each of
your<00:06:00.939> tricks<00:06:01.509> you<00:06:01.750> should<00:06:02.110> be<00:06:02.650> ready<00:06:02.949> setting

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
your tricks you should be ready setting

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.040 
your tricks you should be ready setting
when<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.580> find<00:06:03.789> the<00:06:03.849> stuff<00:06:04.030> but<00:06:04.539> anyways<00:06:04.629> the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
when I find the stuff but anyways the

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.570 
when I find the stuff but anyways the
last<00:06:05.500> run<00:06:05.770> is<00:06:05.949> gonna<00:06:06.129> be<00:06:06.479> on<00:06:07.479> the<00:06:08.139> left<00:06:08.319> run

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
last run is gonna be on the left run

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.469 
last run is gonna be on the left run
basically<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:09.729> same<00:06:09.909> as<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.150> thing<00:06:10.360> is

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
basically it's the same as that thing is

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.300 
basically it's the same as that thing is
the<00:06:10.599> one<00:06:10.750> push<00:06:10.930> run<00:06:11.169> and<00:06:11.469> the<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.680> push<00:06:11.860> run<00:06:12.039> and

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
the one push run and the to push run and

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.879 
the one push run and the to push run and
hop<00:06:12.729> on<00:06:12.969> run<00:06:13.180> but<00:06:13.810> just<00:06:14.020> simply<00:06:14.409> going<00:06:14.680> to<00:06:14.800> the

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
hop on run but just simply going to the

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.320 
hop on run but just simply going to the
left<00:06:15.189> you<00:06:15.310> guys<00:06:15.460> don't<00:06:15.610> only<00:06:15.879> have<00:06:15.939> to<00:06:16.150> go<00:06:16.270> to

lefty goes to the left you can go to the

lefty goes to the left you can go to the
left<00:06:20.680> on<00:06:20.770> this<00:06:20.889> map<00:06:21.099> this<00:06:21.219> map<00:06:21.400> is<00:06:21.580> real<00:06:21.789> pagan

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
left on this map this map is real pagan

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.439 
left on this map this map is real pagan
is<00:06:22.569> real<00:06:22.840> like<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:24.219> guess<00:06:24.610> you<00:06:24.639> could<00:06:24.909> say<00:06:25.060> I'm

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
is real like I guess you could say I'm

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.290 
is real like I guess you could say I'm
free<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.530> do<00:06:26.680> whatever<00:06:26.770> you<00:06:26.979> want<00:06:27.219> so<00:06:27.460> he's

free to do whatever you want so he's

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.640 
free to do whatever you want so he's
going<00:06:28.449> to<00:06:28.629> the<00:06:28.719> left<00:06:28.900> and<00:06:29.080> as<00:06:29.259> you<00:06:29.379> see<00:06:29.530> when

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
going to the left and as you see when

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.899 
going to the left and as you see when
going<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:29.919> the<00:06:30.069> left<00:06:30.280> he's<00:06:30.430> gonna<00:06:30.520> go<00:06:30.669> right<00:06:30.879> to

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
going to the left he's gonna go right to

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:32.939 
going to the left he's gonna go right to
this<00:06:31.060> little<00:06:31.419> ramp<00:06:31.569> right<00:06:31.779> here<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.169> make<00:06:32.919> a

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
this little ramp right here and make a

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.800 
this little ramp right here and make a
quick<00:06:33.189> turn<00:06:33.759> around<00:06:33.819> and<00:06:34.300> go<00:06:34.360> back<00:06:34.509> to<00:06:34.689> this

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
quick turn around and go back to this

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.320 
quick turn around and go back to this
one<00:06:35.080> where<00:06:35.680> he<00:06:35.740> started<00:06:36.099> from<00:06:36.279> and<00:06:36.729> the<00:06:37.120> same

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
one where he started from and the same

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.850 
one where he started from and the same
exact<00:06:37.629> thing<00:06:37.870> I<00:06:38.020> believe<00:06:38.289> the<00:06:38.379> left<00:06:38.560> run<00:06:38.740> is

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
exact thing I believe the left run is

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.260 
exact thing I believe the left run is
way<00:06:39.009> more<00:06:39.189> easier<00:06:39.520> than<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:39.759> right<00:06:39.909> run<00:06:40.120> just

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
way more easier than the right run just

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.010 
way more easier than the right run just
because<00:06:40.509> the<00:06:41.439> ramp<00:06:41.680> comes<00:06:41.949> faster<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:43.020> you

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
because the ramp comes faster and you

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.899 
because the ramp comes faster and you
become<00:06:44.409> a<00:06:44.680> sycamore<00:06:45.279> schooler

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
become a sycamore schooler

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.909 
become a sycamore schooler
going<00:06:46.240> to<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.419> left<00:06:46.599> I'm<00:06:46.900> not<00:06:46.960> too<00:06:47.590> sure<00:06:47.800> s

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919
