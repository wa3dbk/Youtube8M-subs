took two of re and I sitting here now

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.320 
took two of re and I sitting here now
you<00:01:20.790> may<00:01:21.119> say<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.780> straight<00:01:22.290> I

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
you may say that it's not straight I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.940 
you may say that it's not straight I
lines<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> 14<00:01:25.140> millimeter<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.740> very

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
lines with the 14 millimeter are very

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.240 
lines with the 14 millimeter are very
difficult<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.390> top<00:01:27.630> here

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
difficult if you look up top here

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
difficult if you look up top here
everything's<00:01:29.250> straight<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.360> bulbs<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
everything's straight the bulbs the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
everything's straight the bulbs the
spheres<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> lights<00:01:32.040> they're<00:01:32.700> straight

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
spheres of the lights they're straight

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
spheres of the lights they're straight
as<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.049> too<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
as you get down here too I'm going to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.020 
as you get down here too I'm going to
sneeze<00:01:37.159> yo<00:01:39.259> excuse<00:01:40.259> me<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> it

sneeze yo excuse me you can see that it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
sneeze yo excuse me you can see that it
looks<00:01:42.200> not<00:01:43.200> straight<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> may

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
looks not straight but I think that may

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
looks not straight but I think that may
have<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.299> something<00:01:45.540> more<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> angle

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
have to do something more with the angle

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
have to do something more with the angle
that<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.799> lined<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.729> camera<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:48.930> not

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
show you if we were to line up the angle

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.889 
show you if we were to line up the angle
based<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.899> line<00:01:56.360> look<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> bulbs

I process<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.370> Lightroom<00:02:14.790> 4<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.960> have

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
I process this in Lightroom 4 and I have

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.560 
I process this in Lightroom 4 and I have
all<00:02:16.320> my<00:02:16.350> saved<00:02:16.860> settings<00:02:17.220> over<00:02:17.670> here<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.180> we

all my saved settings over here and we

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.320 
all my saved settings over here and we
can<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.870> start<00:02:18.960> with<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> did<00:02:20.090> black<00:02:21.090> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
can just start with what I did black and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.570 
can just start with what I did black and
white<00:02:21.390> first<00:02:22.200> things<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.830> most<00:02:23.070> black<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
white first things in for most black and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.170 
white first things in for most black and
white<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:24.500> tone<00:02:25.500> curve<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.130> move<00:02:26.460> too<00:02:26.730> strong

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
white then tone curve I move too strong

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.610 
white then tone curve I move too strong
and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.600> move<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.780> too<00:02:28.080> strong<00:02:28.320> because<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
and I move that too strong because I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.890 
and I move that too strong because I
want<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.310> punchy<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.880> crispy<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
crunchy and I'm sure I could probably go

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.330 
crunchy and I'm sure I could probably go
into<00:02:33.000> silver<00:02:33.480> effects<00:02:33.840> pro<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.440> use<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:34.950> but

keep moving on boom pumped up my

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.980 
keep moving on boom pumped up my
contrast<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.760> love<00:02:48.240> booma<00:02:48.600> finding<00:02:48.900> my

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.600 
contrast it's funny I'm going to do that
again<00:02:51.110> bumped<00:02:52.110> my<00:02:52.260> exposure<00:02:52.650> slightly<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
again bumped my exposure slightly and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.270 
again bumped my exposure slightly and
then<00:02:53.840> boom<00:02:54.840> ified<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.260> contrast<00:02:55.740> even<00:02:56.040> more

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
then boom ified the contrast even more

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
then boom ified the contrast even more
now<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.940> point<00:02:57.090> something<00:02:57.210> out<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
can see that these slats over here are a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.500 
can see that these slats over here are a
little<00:03:02.220> more<00:03:02.460> they<00:03:02.670> look<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.910> be<00:03:02.940> open<00:03:03.330> there's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
little more they look to be open there's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.150 
little more they look to be open there's
more<00:03:03.660> light<00:03:03.810> coming<00:03:04.170> into<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.440> shining<00:03:05.040> on

it less light coming in on my face how I
expose<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.350> guessed<00:03:11.250> my

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
expose for this I just guessed my

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.480 
expose for this I just guessed my
settings<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.330> based<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.200> off<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.650> f4

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
settings and and based it off of just f4

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.190 
settings and and based it off of just f4
I<00:03:14.520> wanted<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.150> more<00:03:15.390> things<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.810> focus

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
I wanted to have more things in focus

I wanted to have more things in focus
this<00:03:16.380> time<00:03:16.640> a<00:03:17.640> thousand<00:03:18.330> iso<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.110> give

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
this time a thousand iso is just to give

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.990 
this time a thousand iso is just to give
me<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.440> shutter<00:03:19.709> speed<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.400> case<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.850> were

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
me that shutter speed in case we were

me that shutter speed in case we were
moving<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.570> give<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.870> little<00:03:22.080> bit<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.380> a

now<00:03:27.209> you've<00:03:27.360> got<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.570> shadow<00:03:27.870> slider<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
now you've got the shadow slider a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.420 
now you've got the shadow slider a
little<00:03:28.709> bit<00:03:29.520> of<00:03:29.610> highlights<00:03:30.890> bumped<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:32.070> exit

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
little bit of highlights bumped my exit

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.530 
little bit of highlights bumped my exit
it<00:03:32.670> changed<00:03:33.600> my<00:03:33.750> exposure<00:03:34.110> again<00:03:35.000> now<00:03:36.000> kicked

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
it changed my exposure again now kicked

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.820 
it changed my exposure again now kicked
in<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> shadows<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:37.680> what's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
in with the shadows do you see what's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.900 
in with the shadows do you see what's
happening<00:03:38.190> when<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.370> use<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.520> shadow

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
happening when you use that shadow

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.460 
happening when you use that shadow
slider<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.480> kind<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.020> fill<00:03:40.260> light

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.470 
slider it's kind of like the fill light
only<00:03:41.220> better<00:03:41.459> because<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:42.000> only<00:03:42.180> changes

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
only better because it only changes

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.840 
only better because it only changes
certain<00:03:42.989> parts<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.980> image<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.610> think

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
certain parts of the image and I think

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.400 
certain parts of the image and I think
it<00:03:44.940> makes<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.209> better<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.780> look<00:03:45.959> what<00:03:46.110> happens

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
it makes it better and look what happens

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.090 
it makes it better and look what happens
now<00:03:46.560> when<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.860> touch<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.070> clarity<00:03:47.670> slider<00:03:49.100> you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
now when we touch the clarity slider you

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.340 
now when we touch the clarity slider you
go<00:03:50.130> from<00:03:50.610> shadow<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.080> boom

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
go from shadow like that and then boom

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.630 
go from shadow like that and then boom
Clary<00:03:53.250> slider<00:03:53.610> tightens<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.640> that's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
Clary slider tightens it up and that's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.610 
Clary slider tightens it up and that's
where<00:03:56.910> i<00:03:56.940> exported<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.930> there<00:03:58.110> more<00:03:58.290> work<00:03:58.500> I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
where i exported it is there more work I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.020 
where i exported it is there more work I
could<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.100> I'll<00:03:59.640> just<00:03:59.760> pump<00:03:59.970> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
could do to this I'll just pump the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.820 
could do to this I'll just pump the
contrast<00:04:00.510> again<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:00.989> let's<00:04:01.410> look<00:04:01.560> at<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
contrast again and let's look at the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.300 
contrast again and let's look at the
White<00:04:02.010> levels<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.550> can<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:02.910> see<00:04:03.150> as<00:04:04.100> we<00:04:05.100> move

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
White levels you can just see as we move

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.850 
White levels you can just see as we move
them<00:04:05.550> what's<00:04:05.820> happening<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.560> don't<00:04:07.560> want<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.769> go
