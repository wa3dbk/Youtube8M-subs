00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.500
 hello friends with you mr. bliss and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.230
 here many had such a problem with 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.050
 lags in minecraft, and in this video I tell you 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.590
 show you how to get rid of these vlogov 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.220
 using optifine and mod optifine this 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.410
 mod requires mate hit foggia 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.130
 this is an ordinary hank and rebuild i am not 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 I will show because it is already a long time 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.870
 get all this done and then you can 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.929
 find on youtube is dangerous to take as 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.660
 Link to download 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.179
 optifine and I will also be off well now 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.980
 I will show you so well, exactly how it 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.600
 set up to minecraft you a lot 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 wave of this remember what my lags 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.859
 were minecraft when i set 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.800
 optifine clever has become much less and 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.929
 Now I will show you how to configure it. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.179
 actually go in the forehead chance video 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.999
 settings and the site is not starting to set 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.580
 all as needed 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:09.850
 brother graphics we expose fast 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.660
 because it should affect 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.670
 husky nose performance 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.410
 meaning compartments they know how well how anyone 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.860
 but I have for example the meaning of it at all 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.200
 This is a kind of soft lighting. 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.910
 For example here you have there the shade is like 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.560
 on chen affects but in my opinion 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.450
 minecraft manufacturer is no way 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.620
 should affect maybe some 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.350
 it really affects 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.870
 can basically disable but you 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.140
 Mycroft will not be so beautiful 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.460
 therefore I advise it is better to include and there in 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.840
 principle will not greatly affect lags 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.150
 then we set fog of because because 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.550
 which he knows to explain the textures north 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.520
 match me so i don't lag in a shot 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.780
 distance rows are very loading well then 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 there is a distance that you will have 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.090
 All immersed here is normal 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.430
 rank 4 that is enough 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.670
 I can even have a good distance 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.170
 by the way will be ok on mom 80 y 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.630
 me even on the norm I even on the gun me 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.670
 even on the farm okay by the way these 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.440
 bun make out if you are here if 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.820
 you can lag so badly 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.130
 put a short plus 32 or short plus 16 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.560
 so I put that when the season was still 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.570
 above ps and the fact that I was limited 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.750
 worth here I'll put on fa 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.510
 it is of course very cool but it is very 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.350
 good option very good option 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.350
 it affects us enough fps of course 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.100
 Olympia is set because far 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.250
 to drawing it is very cool in general 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.660
 there will be much further everything is loaded 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.010
 yes by the way still adds the zoom-zoom 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.490
 I will not show the zone there 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.280
 controller throw well she go on 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.960
 video settings 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.410
 put but if you lag maniac 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.550
 put 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:18.470
 that plus 32 or went without 16 actually 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.680
 pif performs fps max ps blizzard bing 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.400
 what is bing blizzard see when i run 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.590
 I have this as I run then wait for me 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.300
 This is what has become such a perez experience 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.950
 my head is mages so i'm running 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.020
 and the feeling that I like him fine 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.140
 and my hand is shaking there 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.850
 boobs shaking but i run means u 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.800
 my hand starts shaking so much and if i 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.430
 unplugged the south bing it feels like we're 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.720
 we fly at all 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.930
 in fact that's why I advise you 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.170
 disable exactly the opposite turn on any 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.280
 bing it in theory should not 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.300
 affect performance 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.370
 minecraft i don't know advance advanced 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.400
 I don't know about angel 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.140
 collapsed yourself expose because here 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.550
 for example, everything is fine with me 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.160
 I expose ooh ooh I really like helping 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.410
 you would almost test it yourself 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.799
 man loading this loading chunks 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.630
 put it on if u lag so 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.450
 maycroft try to put on default 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.860
 or on smooth rasmus it's still there for a bit 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.440
 will pat I do not know here 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.980
 for example, I put me on multicore 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.740
 everything is fine damage just super fox start 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.480
 don't touch 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.419
 here if here touched nothing 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.330
 besides two functions, even here is one 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.240
 such an awesome function clear water 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.840
 he will now explain to you what it is 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.910
 climate he thing is with this feature 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.710
 your water will become much more beautiful you 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.620
 you can see much better underwater 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.710
 In general, everything will be cool and what if 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.450
 put all 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.760
 car because you all start to be dull 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.030
 and take it, and so it became 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.090
 and this one is turbid turbidity 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.370
 she devours the memory she starts it all 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.330
 heal light and better put 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.470
 of course on matron glue contest itself 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.900
 o paste it this is a swamp color 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.260
 swamp- colored vas and swamps will become 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.530
 a more beautiful place will be more general 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.110
 among this so on we go to the spin 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.480
 sing connected texture of yet 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.240
 put her perfumes here 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.710
 we go here 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:47.570
 vps can put and loading chunks 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.030
 I also have 2 well 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.070
 so here you need to configure optifine on 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.990
 so as not to lag I do not know how powerfully 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.360
 me here personally after i so 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.220
 set up my laptop and but on the laptop 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.020
 generally very well impose on the computer 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.470
 absolutely nothing that should 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.780
 have 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.970
