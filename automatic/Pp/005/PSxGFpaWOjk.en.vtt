so<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.710> lot<00:01:15.860> happening<00:01:16.280> with<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.490> field

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so a lot happening with the field

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.290 
so a lot happening with the field
placings<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.360> think<00:01:17.600> they've<00:01:18.560> now<00:01:18.770> settled<00:01:19.370> to

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
placings I think they've now settled to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.670 
placings I think they've now settled to
a<00:01:20.330> whyfor<00:01:21.020> field<00:01:21.680> or<00:01:21.920> still<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.820> certain

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
a whyfor field or still in certain

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640 
a whyfor field or still in certain
directions<00:01:24.680> being<00:01:25.250> given<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:25.700> think<00:01:26.650> these

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
directions being given I think these

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.350 
directions being given I think these
things<00:01:27.890> are<00:01:28.100> bound<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.670> happen<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:29.090> they

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
things are bound to happen because they

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.680 
things are bound to happen because they
are<00:01:29.420> not<00:01:29.540> professional<00:01:30.080> cricketers<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.690> all

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
are not professional cricketers and all

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.340 
are not professional cricketers and all
of<00:01:32.900> them<00:01:34.120> coming<00:01:35.120> together<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.750> probably

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
of them coming together and probably

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.070 
of them coming together and probably
arriving<00:01:36.980> at<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> consensus<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.000> how<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.660> field

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
arriving at a consensus of how the field

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.120 
arriving at a consensus of how the field
should<00:01:39.320> be<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:39.710> eventually<00:01:41.350> they<00:01:42.350> go<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.560> ball

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
should be so eventually they go to ball

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.710 
should be so eventually they go to ball
to<00:01:43.370> a<00:01:43.400> 6-3<00:01:43.970> field<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:46.340> backed<00:01:46.910> out<00:01:47.120> offside

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
to a 6-3 field of backed out offside

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.410 
to a 6-3 field of backed out offside
field

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.650 

that's<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.080> first<00:01:52.350> wide<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> intention<00:01:54.510> was

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
that's the first wide the intention was

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.720 
that's the first wide the intention was
right<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.380> ball<00:01:55.560> outside<00:01:55.980> off<00:01:56.160> some<00:01:56.460> because

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
right to ball outside off some because

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.290 
right to ball outside off some because
that's<00:01:57.030> where<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> fielders<00:01:57.960> are<00:01:59.300> we're

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
that's where all the fielders are we're

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.320 
that's where all the fielders are we're
just<00:02:00.480> praying<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.080> wider

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.790 

that's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> very<00:02:09.539> strange<00:02:09.960> kind<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.320> an<00:02:10.470> action

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that's a very strange kind of an action

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.960 
that's a very strange kind of an action
it's<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.039> easy<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.460> him<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.790> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it's not easy for him to get that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.890 
it's not easy for him to get that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:10.050 
ticket is sold I think all of them are
houseful

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.950

I<00:03:14.700> remember<00:03:15.700> watching<00:03:15.880> him<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.240> day<00:03:16.360> and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
I remember watching him in the day and

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.850 
I remember watching him in the day and
in<00:03:16.630> Hindi<00:03:16.870> movies<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.470> think<00:03:17.710> it<00:03:17.770> was

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
in Hindi movies and I think it was

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.640 
in Hindi movies and I think it was
called<00:03:18.040> kala<00:03:18.280> pani<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.930> he<00:03:20.020> acted<00:03:20.170> quite<00:03:20.440> well

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
called kala pani and he acted quite well

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.900 
called kala pani and he acted quite well
in<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:21.000> flick<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.930> crossover<00:03:26.380> from<00:03:26.910> the

in that flick that crossover from the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.449 
in that flick that crossover from the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
cinema to Hindi cinema hasn't taken

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.220 
cinema to Hindi cinema hasn't taken
place<00:03:31.680> good<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.830> every<00:03:33.100> loud<00:03:33.880> appeal<00:03:34.240> and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
place good in every loud appeal and

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.840 
place good in every loud appeal and
there<00:03:35.380> was<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> moment<00:03:35.950> in<00:03:36.010> there<00:03:36.190> for<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
there was a moment in there for the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.090 
there was a moment in there for the
bowler<00:03:37.600> Shiva<00:03:39.450> well<00:03:40.450> Shiva<00:03:40.840> has<00:03:41.620> been<00:03:41.860> spoken

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
bowler Shiva well Shiva has been spoken

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.610 
bowler Shiva well Shiva has been spoken
about<00:03:42.310> both<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.000> wrong<00:03:43.180> foot<00:03:43.450> nice<00:03:44.290> scene

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
about both of the wrong foot nice scene

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.870 
about both of the wrong foot nice scene
positions<00:03:45.070> facing<00:03:46.000> towards<00:03:46.360> fine<00:03:46.600> leg<00:03:47.880> that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
positions facing towards fine leg that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.560 
positions facing towards fine leg that
probably<00:03:49.420> helped<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.020> ball<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:51.430> get<00:03:52.300> it

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
probably helped the ball to get it

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.510 
probably helped the ball to get it
towards<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.260> leg<00:03:53.410> side<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:56.040> nicely<00:03:57.040> played

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
towards the leg side of it nicely played

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.570 
towards the leg side of it nicely played
on<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:58.450> protection<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.230> deep<00:03:59.380> they<00:04:00.370> run

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
on this protection and the deep they run

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:11.490 
on this protection and the deep they run
hard<00:04:03.300> come<00:04:04.300> back<00:04:04.480> for<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> comfortable<00:04:05.170> second

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.070 

I<00:04:11.530> think<00:04:12.100> that's<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.340> best<00:04:12.460> part<00:04:12.670> about

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
I think that's the best part about

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.800 
I think that's the best part about
celebrated<00:04:14.080> Cricket<00:04:14.350> League<00:04:14.380> Sunday<00:04:14.860> because

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
at most of these players at some point

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.400 
at most of these players at some point
of<00:04:23.770> their<00:04:23.950> career<00:04:24.850> or<00:04:24.880> their<00:04:25.090> life<00:04:25.330> they<00:04:26.230> have

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
basics there because they haven't played

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.230 
basics there because they haven't played
this<00:04:32.110> game<00:04:32.200> regularly<00:04:32.820> they<00:04:33.820> need<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.060> work

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
this game regularly they need to work

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.730

rhinos<00:04:42.430> were<00:04:42.850> also<00:04:43.090> there<00:04:43.270> all<00:04:43.570> of<00:04:43.900> them

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
rhinos were also there all of them

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.050 
rhinos were also there all of them
really<00:04:44.140> coming<00:04:44.560> all<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.580> them<00:04:45.670> really<00:04:45.850> worked

really coming all of them really worked
very<00:04:46.180> hard<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:47.050> put<00:04:47.200> up<00:04:47.230> a<00:04:47.350> good<00:04:47.500> show<00:04:47.670> and<00:04:48.780> here

very hard to put up a good show and here
also<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.140> think<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.740> little<00:04:51.160> bit<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:53.380> know

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
also I think a little bit of you know

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.990 
also I think a little bit of you know
commitment<00:04:53.920> one<00:04:54.040> can<00:04:54.220> see<00:04:54.400> at<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.850> very

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
commitment one can see at the very

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.070 
commitment one can see at the very
beginning<00:04:59.670> got<00:05:00.670> him<00:05:00.820> got<00:05:01.120> in<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.420> time<00:05:01.600> off

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
beginning got him got in this time off

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.650 
beginning got him got in this time off
the<00:05:02.320> pair's<00:05:02.560> onto<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.160> stumps<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:04.540> the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
the pair's onto the stumps and the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.300 
the pair's onto the stumps and the
umpire<00:05:04.930> is<00:05:05.140> not<00:05:05.290> very<00:05:05.470> happy<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:05.860> yes<00:05:06.130> he's

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
umpire is not very happy so yes he's

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.990 
umpire is not very happy so yes he's
giving<00:05:06.580> him<00:05:06.670> out<00:05:06.790> so<00:05:07.030> first<00:05:07.300> little<00:05:07.720> balls<00:05:07.960> for

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.250 

so<00:05:13.570> chemists<00:05:13.960> write<00:05:14.140> those<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.470> ten<00:05:14.680> for<00:05:14.860> one

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
so chemists write those the ten for one

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.380 
so chemists write those the ten for one
that's<00:05:17.260> unlucky<00:05:17.620> we<00:05:17.890> are<00:05:18.010> getting<00:05:18.340> out<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.490> the
