00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
figured out already absolutely and it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
figured out already absolutely and it's
impressive<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.790> how<00:01:39.000> quickly<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.840> pros

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
impressive to see how quickly these pros

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
impressive to see how quickly these pros
have<00:01:40.799> caught<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.270> thing

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
have caught on but there is one thing

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
have caught on but there is one thing
I've<00:01:42.720> noticed<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.530> sure<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.710> lot<00:01:43.860> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I've noticed that I'm not sure a lot of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.730 
I've noticed that I'm not sure a lot of
people<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:45.450> tuned<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.259> even<00:01:46.500> caught

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
people have tuned into or even caught

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
people have tuned into or even caught
yet<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.360> ordnance<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
yet but when you have your ordnance it's

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
yet but when you have your ordnance it's
almost<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.829> good<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> hold<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
almost not as good to hold on to it and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
almost not as good to hold on to it and
save<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.049> later<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.590> you're<00:01:52.770> not

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
save it for later because you're not

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.889 
save it for later because you're not
building<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.700> points<00:01:54.210> sure<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> while<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
building up points sure it while you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.469 
building up points sure it while you
wait<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.189> sooner<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.640> call<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
wait so the sooner you call it in the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
wait so the sooner you call it in the
sooner<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:57.990> start<00:01:58.049> building<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.829> your

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
sooner you can start building up your

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
sooner you can start building up your
next<00:01:59.310> ordnance<00:01:59.700> drop<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.180> while<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> understand

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
next ordnance drop so while I understand

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
next ordnance drop so while I understand
the<00:02:01.409> merits<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:02.340> heinz<00:02:02.700> does<00:02:02.969> pick<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.299> as

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the merits as heinz does pick up as

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.670 
the merits as heinz does pick up as
ordinance<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.899> we'll<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.259> he<00:02:04.350> calls<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
ordinance there we'll see if he calls it

ordinance there we'll see if he calls it
in<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:04.920> away<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.280> wait<00:02:05.310> yeah

building<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.330> points<00:02:15.630> again<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:15.959> sometimes

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
building up points again so sometimes

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.410 
building up points again so sometimes
it's<00:02:16.560> nice<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.950> call<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.270> it
