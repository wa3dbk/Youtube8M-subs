00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
little brushes so don't start with these

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.200 
little brushes so don't start with these
these<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.560> details<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.189> make<00:00:23.760> sure<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
brush is especially a big detail the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
brush is especially a big detail the
small<00:00:37.649> ones<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.520> nice<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.879> straight

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like that one is and then the middle

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200 
like that one is and then the middle
sized<00:00:42.809> brushes<00:00:43.219> are<00:00:44.219> great<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.910> especially

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sized brushes are great and especially

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.680 
sized brushes are great and especially
if<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.950> ones<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.690> little

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
if you have these ones that are little

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350 
if you have these ones that are little
angles<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> top<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.059> really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
angles at the top because it's really

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
angles at the top because it's really
great<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.780> doing<00:00:52.710> lines<00:00:54.590> just<00:00:55.590> sort<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
great for doing lines just sort of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
great for doing lines just sort of
pushing<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> paint<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.879> I'll<00:00:56.969> show<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.239> more

pushing the paint and I'll show you more
about<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.930> when<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.289> start

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
about this when I actually start

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.400 
about this when I actually start
painting<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.760> these<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.930> nice<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
painting but these are really nice to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.579 
painting but these are really nice to
have<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:02.270> that<00:01:03.270> sort<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> middle<00:01:03.960> size<00:01:04.199> line

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
have for that sort of middle size line

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.500 
have for that sort of middle size line
and<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.309> really<00:01:05.460> controlling<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.510> shape

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and for really controlling the the shape

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
and for really controlling the the shape
of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> line<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.770> opposed<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> flatter

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of the line as opposed to the flatter

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
of the line as opposed to the flatter
brush<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.049> much

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
brush you just don't have quite as much

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.289 
brush you just don't have quite as much
control<00:01:13.799> they're<00:01:14.040> good<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:14.369> coverage<00:01:14.760> but

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
control they're good for coverage but

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
control they're good for coverage but
not<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.750> control<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:19.520> larger

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
not as much control and then the larger

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.770 
not as much control and then the larger
brushes<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:23.100> want<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.630> these<00:01:24.630> are

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
brushes you really want to these are

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
brushes you really want to these are
great<00:01:24.990> obviously<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.159> start<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.909> for

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
great obviously to start with and for

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
great obviously to start with and for
the<00:01:27.570> most<00:01:27.720> coverage<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the most coverage and what you want to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.319 
the most coverage and what you want to
be<00:01:30.360> aware<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.619> painting

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
be aware of is when you're painting

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
be aware of is when you're painting
you're<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you're going to see some of the the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
you're going to see some of the the
brush<00:01:35.729> marks<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.189> don't<00:01:38.270> don't<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:39.500> really

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
brush marks so don't don't get really

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
brush marks so don't don't get really
hard<00:01:40.890> bristle<00:01:41.549> brushes<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.329> you'll<00:01:42.509> see

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
hard bristle brushes because you'll see

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
hard bristle brushes because you'll see
more<00:01:43.079> brush<00:01:43.530> marks<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.130> those<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
more brush marks with those you want to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.200 
more brush marks with those you want to
try<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> softer<00:01:46.079> brushes<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.850> then

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
try to get the softer brushes and then

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.730 
try to get the softer brushes and then
when<00:01:48.840> you're<00:01:49.170> doing<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.829> large<00:01:50.520> surface<00:01:50.850> area

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
when you're doing a large surface area

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.209 
when you're doing a large surface area
make<00:01:52.740> sure<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.130> you're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:54.090> over<00:01:54.659> like

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
make sure that you're going over like

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.280 
make sure that you're going over like
the<00:01:56.219> area<00:01:56.579> you're<00:01:57.570> sort<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the area you're sort of going in a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.580 
the area you're sort of going in a
circular<00:01:58.560> motion<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.840> paint<00:02:01.380> isn't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
circular motion so that the paint isn't

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.959 
circular motion so that the paint isn't
drying<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.820> brush<00:02:03.060> marks<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
drying with the brush marks in it so

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.950 
drying with the brush marks in it so
that's<00:02:05.969> pretty<00:02:06.180> much<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that's pretty much you want what you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
using before basically I've had some of

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.990

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
these brushes for so many years I can't

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.760 
these brushes for so many years I can't
even<00:02:22.090> remember<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:23.020> good<00:02:23.320> brushes

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
even remember if you have good brushes

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.470 
even remember if you have good brushes
and<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.280> take<00:02:24.610> care<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:25.000> them<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.420> know

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and you take care of them and I know

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.910 
and you take care of them and I know
