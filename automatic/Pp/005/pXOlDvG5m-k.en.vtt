00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.160 

we<00:02:47.430> try<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.330> shop<00:02:48.780> soon<00:02:49.080> as

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
we try to get this back in shop soon as

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.730 
we try to get this back in shop soon as
I<00:02:49.230> cut<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> throat<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.990> don't<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.560> this

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
I cut the throat I don't know if this

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.290 
I cut the throat I don't know if this
can<00:02:55.920> focus<00:02:56.220> for<00:02:56.610> me<00:02:56.790> sufficient<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:59.300> but

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
can focus for me sufficient and but

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.240 
can focus for me sufficient and but
there's<00:03:00.510> stitching<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.010> back

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
there's stitching there's the back

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.100 
there's stitching there's the back
stitching<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:04.830> my<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.220> my<00:03:05.400> locks

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.630 

so<00:03:09.650> I'm<00:03:09.860> very<00:03:09.890> satisfied<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.180> and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
so I'm very satisfied with this and

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.220 
so I'm very satisfied with this and
again<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.150> do<00:03:14.270> heavier<00:03:14.900> leather

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
again if you have to do heavier leather

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.890 
again if you have to do heavier leather
and<00:03:15.830> this<00:03:16.070> is<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:16.700> about<00:03:16.970> quarter<00:03:17.750> inch

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
and this is this is about quarter inch

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.440 
and this is this is about quarter inch
thickness<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.530> leather<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:20.000> machine's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
thickness of leather this machine's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.380 
thickness of leather this machine's
probably<00:03:21.050> capable<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.710> doing<00:03:22.040> up<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.550> 3/8<00:03:23.090> inch

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
probably capable of doing up to 3/8 inch

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.070 
probably capable of doing up to 3/8 inch
and<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.950> might<00:03:25.520> have<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.850> do<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> reducer<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.840> get

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
and I might have to do a reducer to get

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.400 
and I might have to do a reducer to get
punching<00:03:27.470> power<00:03:27.620> for<00:03:27.950> 3/8<00:03:28.250> inch<00:03:28.520> I'm<00:03:28.670> not<00:03:28.880> sure

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
punching power for 3/8 inch I'm not sure

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.870 
punching power for 3/8 inch I'm not sure
also<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.860> 138<00:03:31.760> thread<00:03:32.390> top<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.110> bottom

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
also this is 138 thread top and bottom

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.930 
also this is 138 thread top and bottom
and<00:03:34.880> it's<00:03:35.210> sewing<00:03:35.480> very<00:03:36.260> well<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.070> some

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
and it's sewing very well for me some

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.730 
and it's sewing very well for me some
guys<00:03:38.150> say<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.600> need<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.870> go<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.140> 90<00:03:39.560> to

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740

like<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:48.950> say<00:03:49.190> I'm<00:03:49.400> going<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.610> I'm<00:03:49.850> going<00:03:50.000> to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
like I say I'm going to I'm going to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.210 
like I say I'm going to I'm going to
experiment<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.350> smaller<00:03:51.710> Pole<00:03:52.040> I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
experiment and get the smaller Pole I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.310 
experiment and get the smaller Pole I
haven't<00:03:52.520> even<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.970> haven't<00:03:53.540> even<00:03:53.600> changed<00:03:53.960> the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
haven't even I haven't even changed the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.980 
haven't even I haven't even changed the
pulley<00:03:55.250> diameter<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.090> what<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.750> came

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
pulley diameter this is what it came

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.800 
pulley diameter this is what it came
with<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.350> an<00:03:57.470> 80<00:03:57.650> millimeter<00:03:58.220> pulley<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.240> I

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
with is an 80 millimeter pulley and I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.270 
with is an 80 millimeter pulley and I
haven't<00:04:00.110> even<00:04:00.170> changed<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.920> I'm<00:04:01.100> going<00:04:01.250> to

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
haven't even changed that I'm going to

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.490 
haven't even changed that I'm going to
actually<00:04:01.850> do<00:04:02.480> some<00:04:02.690> experimenting<00:04:03.410> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
actually do some experimenting and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.340 
actually do some experimenting and
change<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.780> probably<00:04:05.780> one<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.110> three

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
change that to a probably one to three

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.740 
change that to a probably one to three
quarter<00:04:06.770> or<00:04:06.890> two<00:04:07.100> inch<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.610> see<00:04:07.820> exactly<00:04:08.480> how

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
quarter or two inch and see exactly how

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.360 
quarter or two inch and see exactly how
slow<00:04:09.050> this<00:04:09.230> will<00:04:09.380> go<00:04:09.530> my<00:04:09.680> guesses<00:04:10.070> will<00:04:10.220> go

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
slow this will go my guesses will go

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.260 
slow this will go my guesses will go
down<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.730> crawl<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.640> leather<00:04:13.640> workers<00:04:14.090> out

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
down to a crawl so leather workers out

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.650 
down to a crawl so leather workers out
there<00:04:14.300> people<00:04:15.050> using<00:04:15.980> very<00:04:16.250> heavy<00:04:16.520> canvas<00:04:17.510> or

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
there people using very heavy canvas or

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.710 
there people using very heavy canvas or
whatever<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:19.489> might<00:04:19.730> be<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.940> good<00:04:20.090> idea<00:04:20.150> for<00:04:20.600> you

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720
