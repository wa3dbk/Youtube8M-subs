components of the snare that we use is a
swivel<00:01:19.659> system<00:01:20.049> here<00:01:20.289> that<00:01:20.439> goes<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.310> end

find<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:53.169> most<00:01:53.200> desirable<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:55.149> for<00:01:55.359> our

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
find the most desirable and then for our

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.629 
find the most desirable and then for our
stop<00:01:55.840> some<00:01:56.229> people<00:01:56.349> use<00:01:56.679> aluminum<00:01:57.159> foils<00:01:57.459> we

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
stop some people use aluminum foils we

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.219 
stop some people use aluminum foils we
use<00:01:57.849> actually<00:01:58.240> just<00:01:58.450> still<00:01:58.689> nuts

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
use actually just still nuts

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.080 
use actually just still nuts
these<00:01:59.859> have<00:02:00.009> been<00:02:00.099> tested<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:00.729> these<00:02:00.819> break

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
these have been tested and these break

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.550 
these have been tested and these break
at<00:02:01.329> 300<00:02:01.749> pounds<00:02:02.139> so<00:02:02.259> they<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.899> work<00:02:05.139> with<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
at 300 pounds so they will work with the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.580 
at 300 pounds so they will work with the
Utah<00:02:05.739> codes<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.869> we're<00:02:08.080> here<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.289> Utah

Utah codes because we're here in Utah
and<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.310> got<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.550> have<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.670> 300<00:02:10.450> pound

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
and you got to have a 300 pound

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.200 
and you got to have a 300 pound
breakaway<00:02:11.260> if<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.010> snare<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.700> set<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
breakaway if the snare is not set in the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.480 
breakaway if the snare is not set in the
water<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.260> these<00:02:14.470> these<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.950> fill<00:02:15.130> our<00:02:15.280> needs

water so these these to fill our needs
and<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.420> well<00:02:16.570> as<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.080> trap<00:02:17.320> tags

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and as well as we have the trap tags

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.370 
and as well as we have the trap tags
here<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.480> need<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.750> be<00:02:19.780> affixed<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.230> all

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
here that need to be affixed to all

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.420 
here that need to be affixed to all
traps<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.860> snares<00:02:21.390> as<00:02:22.390> far<00:02:22.600> as<00:02:22.750> cable<00:02:23.430> there's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
traps and snares as far as cable there's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.490 
traps and snares as far as cable there's
several<00:02:24.670> different<00:02:24.790> types<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.390> cable<00:02:25.750> with

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
several different types of cable with

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.690 
several different types of cable with
different<00:02:28.200> sizes<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.620> bands<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:30.130> use<00:02:30.370> what's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
different sizes and bands we use what's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.860 
different sizes and bands we use what's
called<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:31.210> seven<00:02:31.540> by<00:02:31.810> seven<00:02:32.670> 332nd<00:02:33.670> width<00:02:33.870> what

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
called a seven by seven 332nd width what

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.930 
called a seven by seven 332nd width what
that<00:02:35.050> means<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.500> there<00:02:35.710> are<00:02:35.800> seven<00:02:36.190> strands<00:02:36.790> of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
that means is there are seven strands of

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.990 
that means is there are seven strands of
seven<00:02:37.630> wound<00:02:38.110> together<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:39.400> find<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.850> be

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
seven wound together we find this to be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.690 
seven wound together we find this to be
the<00:02:40.120> best<00:02:40.480> kind<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.080> overall<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:42.580> can

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
the best kind of overall and you can

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.250 
the best kind of overall and you can
catch<00:02:42.880> anything<00:02:43.150> from<00:02:43.300> raccoons<00:02:43.870> all<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> way

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
catch anything from raccoons all the way

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.100 
catch anything from raccoons all the way
up<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.410> coyotes<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:45.850> are<00:02:46.000> great<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.570> great

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
up to coyotes and it's are great a great

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.990 
up to coyotes and it's are great a great
size<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.710> so<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> one<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.640> we<00:02:48.760> use

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
size and so this is the one that we use

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.850 
size and so this is the one that we use
there's<00:02:49.690> several<00:02:49.930> other<00:02:50.080> sizes<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.560> smaller

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
there's several other sizes are smaller

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.980 
there's several other sizes are smaller
sizes<00:02:51.130> for<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.520> smaller<00:02:51.880> game<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.420> larger<00:02:52.780> for

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
sizes for a smaller game and larger for

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.800 
sizes for a smaller game and larger for
a<00:02:53.230> wolf<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.070> whatnot<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.730> those<00:02:55.630> are<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
a wolf and whatnot so those are the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.110 
a wolf and whatnot so those are the
basic<00:02:56.140> components<00:02:56.710> of<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.860> snare<00:02:57.160> we'll<00:02:58.000> go

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
basic components of a snare we'll go

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.370 
basic components of a snare we'll go
ahead<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.450> show<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.630> how<00:02:58.840> we<00:02:58.900> put<00:02:59.200> ours

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
ahead and show you how we put ours

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.770 
ahead and show you how we put ours
together<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.850> reason<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.150> we<00:03:01.270> one<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
together the reason that we one of the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.840 
together the reason that we one of the
reasons<00:03:02.050> we<00:03:02.170> use<00:03:02.200> snares<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.580> have<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
reasons we use snares is is you have the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.520 
reasons we use snares is is you have the
option<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.180> cut<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.540> cable<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.020> any<00:03:05.230> size

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
option to cut this cable to any size

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.710 
option to cut this cable to any size
that<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.800> want<00:03:06.190> for<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.120> coyotes<00:03:07.600> and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
that you want for like coyotes and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.690 
that you want for like coyotes and
raccoons<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.380> different<00:03:09.100> applications<00:03:09.190> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
raccoons and different applications you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.950 
raccoons and different applications you
want<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.060> little<00:03:10.150> bit<00:03:10.360> longer<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.900> then

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
want it a little bit longer and then

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.680 
want it a little bit longer and then
where<00:03:11.860> you're<00:03:12.040> doing<00:03:12.340> water<00:03:12.820> sets<00:03:13.180> maybe<00:03:13.420> for

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
where you're doing water sets maybe for

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.940 
where you're doing water sets maybe for
beaver<00:03:14.020> or<00:03:14.080> other<00:03:14.200> things<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.650> want<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
beaver or other things you want the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.320 
beaver or other things you want the
snares<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.490> on<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.640> little<00:03:15.910> bit<00:03:16.060> shorter

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
snares to be on a little bit shorter

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.840 
snares to be on a little bit shorter
leash<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.860> snares<00:03:18.130> just<00:03:18.310> provide<00:03:18.610> more

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
leash so the snares just provide more

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.580 
leash so the snares just provide more
versatility<00:03:19.300> we<00:03:19.630> believe<00:03:19.900> that's<00:03:20.230> one<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
versatility we believe that's one of the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.230 
versatility we believe that's one of the
reasons<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:20.860> we<00:03:21.010> use<00:03:21.250> them<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.640> we<00:03:22.030> find

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
reasons that we use them and we find

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.570 
reasons that we use them and we find
them<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.450> be<00:03:22.480> very<00:03:22.720> effective<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:24.310> step<00:03:24.550> one

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
them to be very effective just step one

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.360 
them to be very effective just step one
put<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.270> snare<00:03:25.480> together<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.200> is

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
put in the snare together as it is

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.370 
put in the snare together as it is
putting<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.550> lock<00:03:27.760> onto<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.240> cable<00:03:28.420> what<00:03:29.290> we

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
putting the lock onto the cable what we

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.620 
putting the lock onto the cable what we
do<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.800> run<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.130> through<00:03:30.250> here<00:03:30.630> through

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
do is we run it through here through

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.680 
do is we run it through here through
this<00:03:31.840> small<00:03:32.140> hole<00:03:32.819> get<00:03:33.819> about<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.060> foot<00:03:34.150> or<00:03:34.540> two

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
this small hole get about a foot or two

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.559 
this small hole get about a foot or two
through<00:03:35.110> there<00:03:35.350> loop<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.160> back<00:03:36.190> around<00:03:36.569> and

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
through there loop it back around and

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.199 

one<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.010> tricks<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.519> do<00:04:00.579> is<00:04:01.000> after

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
one of the tricks that I do is after

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.860 
one of the tricks that I do is after
I've<00:04:01.480> attached<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:03.310> lock<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.909> like<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.450> to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
I've attached the the lock I like it to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.229 
I've attached the the lock I like it to
put<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> little<00:04:05.560> kink<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.159> wire<00:04:06.670> so<00:04:07.090> it

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
put a little kink in this wire so it

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.959 
put a little kink in this wire so it
bends<00:04:07.480> away<00:04:07.780> from<00:04:08.019> your<00:04:08.709> your<00:04:09.129> main<00:04:09.340> cable<00:04:09.790> so

kind of put a crank in it like that what

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.099 
kind of put a crank in it like that what
that<00:04:17.410> does<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.889> allows<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:19.539> hang<00:04:19.780> away

from your your main cable so you don't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.200 
from your your main cable so you don't
have<00:04:22.690> any<00:04:22.900> hang-ups<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> that's<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.030> business
