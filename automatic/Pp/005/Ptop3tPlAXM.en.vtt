when<00:00:22.890> working<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.310> horses<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> much<00:00:25.019> more

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
when working with horses so much more

when working with horses so much more
happen<00:00:26.250> than<00:00:27.230> what<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> eye<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.939> they

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
happen than what the eye can see they

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
happen than what the eye can see they
are<00:00:30.029> reading<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.480> energy<00:00:31.099> we're<00:00:32.099> learning

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
are reading your energy we're learning

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.780 
are reading your energy we're learning
to<00:00:32.669> read<00:00:32.820> their<00:00:33.059> energy<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.670> we're<00:00:35.670> learning

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to read their energy and we're learning

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.920 
to read their energy and we're learning
to<00:00:36.120> establish<00:00:37.250> connection<00:00:38.250> based<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.450> respect

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to establish connection based on respect

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.880 
to establish connection based on respect
and<00:00:40.370> trust<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.270> activity<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:43.530> ask<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and trust so in this activity we ask the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.130 
and trust so in this activity we ask the
person<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.579> become<00:00:44.850> conscious<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> creating<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
person to become conscious of creating a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.110 
person to become conscious of creating a
connection<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> horse<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.670> actually
