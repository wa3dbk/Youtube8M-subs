00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.070
 hello youtube friends as you know me 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.350
 I call the dry sleeve and today I bring you another 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.600
 This time, my theory is about 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.570
 cain a red dog let's start with the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.760
 Character presentation takes out more 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.650
 well it is known as the marine fell 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.320
 who currently holds the position of 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.360
 Admiral of the fleet was originally 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.950
 presented as one of the three admires 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.200
 before the navy next to current 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.140
 admiral maybe and the ex admiral out and 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.150
 if it was originally introduced as a 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.830
 vice admiral appearing for the first 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.020
 time in he will do it as one of the 5 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.140
 vice admirals summoned by you 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.970
 cabbage to destroy the island to fell one 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.070
 of the main antagonists of the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.350
 saga of magnet ford where he murdered by 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.479
 those of a year ago is sane so that 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.490
 stabbed with white beard study the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.040
 mobile that caused the scar on the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
 chest to monkey of gluten good my theory 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.360
 basically he's since he came in 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.119
 the navy had planned to do as a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.040
 kind of dictatorship because basically 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.040
 because if we look, he has gone 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.630
 exterminating all your opponents 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.789
 first his big goal was to get to what 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.170
 higher then what did he do in the 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.390
 war of marine corts 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.369
 but to the maximum it delivered a great interest 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 for killing or stopping opponents more 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.659
 strong as a white beard 11 but as 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.390
 he could not kill white beard then 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.490
 he killed ace to compensate a little in what 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.259
 what he planned was to do all this for 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.850
 highlight and so if I did not have to 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.009
 she was not made for this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.049
 basically because of their age when they retire 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.420
 Sengoku in the beginning the great post 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.700
 of admiral of fleet was for ok but 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.860
 as he had already planned everything he took 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.619
 and complained to the only six thus giving a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.960
 great battle in qatar bread as he knew 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.880
 that his fruit was crushing the dea 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.269
 and it did not have any inconvenience and 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.100
 they fought as expected, won the ok 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.110
 and that more or less knew what was 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.910
 planning he took and left the marina 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.040
 because I did not want to be part of this 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.799
 great revolution that will surely change 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.110
 the world of a piece then took and 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.209
 disappeared on several occasions now 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 he has shown us very hooded and very 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.200
 mysterious what is he doing as 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 a little revolution to kick out 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.700
 fallen now has already shown us one of 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.069
 his little steps that is the small 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.450
 competition to replace the post of 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.430
 vice admirals 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.170
 I believe that when I have finished doing it 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.450
 all he only needs the permission of the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.550
 forums 6 I have two theories one that has 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.590
 an accomplice between the group or two that the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.230
 same will try to retire us all and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.910
 stay with the absolute command over what 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.620
 that is plotting I do not have it very clear 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.630
 but the safest thing is that he wants 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.610
 exterminate all piracy as 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.739
 probable is that in his past he had some 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.019
 problem with pirates and that's why he hates them 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.880
 as surely as the marina alone 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.560
 is that he had or something like that because 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.870
 root from there he began to believe in the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.630
 absolute justice rather called the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.700
 dictatorship that's what I think I hope that 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.010
 you liked the video dadle lic and
