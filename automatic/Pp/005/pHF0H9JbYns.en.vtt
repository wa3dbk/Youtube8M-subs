00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 Mohammed taught that there is only one god 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.330
 Christ taught that yes this is true 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.160
 yet we must worship the only God 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.960
 through Jesus Christ he said I am 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 the road to truth and life no one comes 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
 to the father but for me nobody on the side to have 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 or this message 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.170
 this message is preserved since it was 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 Just like that, Jesus says 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.270
 so we agreed that there is a single 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.530
 god but he is worshiped through jesus 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 Christ Moment taught that God is great 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.590
 very high 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.940
 Okay, Christ revealed that the highest god 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 also lives in the heart of the humble and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 contrite written by isaiah mal me 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.469
 that on the day of payment of 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.670
 debts and called han adin 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.890
 only Muslims will be saved 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.830
 Christ announced that on the day of the great 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 court of god only those who want 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.549
 nor will they be free from eternal punishment is 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 registered in acts 1043 maomÃ© taught 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.729
 about the existence of Christ demons 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.820
 reveals in his word that only in his name 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.409
 we have victories over the evil one and his 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.380
 demons taught in the Koran that it is 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.119
 blasphemy to affirm that Jesus Christ is the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.720
 son of God in Christ said that he 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.829
 It is not only the son of God that he 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.320
 and the father 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:55.170
 are mini maomÃ© has taught that it is 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.530
 possible to find happiness and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.280
 paradise through the pillars of Islam 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 which we read just christ announced 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.190
 that only through his sacrifice 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.899
 we get forgiveness qualification certification 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.780
 and eternal life 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.959
 is written in Hebrews 9 13 and 14 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.770
 taught that man is saved by the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.510
 works of the law christ said that salvation 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.400
 it's by grace 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.160
 that's what paulo wrote the setbacks 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.300
 Chapter two verses 8 10 Mohammed in 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.090

 taught that the path that leads to God is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.050
 Christ is revealed to be the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.510
 way 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:51.250
 I am the way and finally Mohammed was the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:56.380
 founder of Islam who was born lived 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.170
