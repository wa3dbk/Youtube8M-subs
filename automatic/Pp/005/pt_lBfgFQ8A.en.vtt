00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
here why is this happening anytime the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.520 
here why is this happening anytime the
skin<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.940> injured<00:00:53.300> obviously<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:54.230> needs<00:00:54.320> to

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
skin is injured obviously it needs to

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.040 
skin is injured obviously it needs to
repair<00:00:54.680> itself<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.640> do<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.270> needs<00:00:56.660> to

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
repair itself and to do that it needs to

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.440 
repair itself and to do that it needs to
bring<00:00:57.230> additional<00:00:57.620> nutrients<00:00:58.370> in<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:59.300> make

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
bring additional nutrients in to make

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.420 
bring additional nutrients in to make
the<00:00:59.629> new<00:00:59.780> cells<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:00.440> repair<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.950> skin<00:01:01.219> and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the new cells that repair the skin and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.880 
the new cells that repair the skin and
to<00:01:01.760> take<00:01:01.940> away<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.300> debris<00:01:02.500> well<00:01:03.500> how<00:01:03.710> do<00:01:03.770> you

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
to take away the debris well how do you

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.950 
to take away the debris well how do you
get<00:01:03.980> those<00:01:04.160> additional<00:01:04.670> nutrients<00:01:05.149> in<00:01:05.360> by

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
get those additional nutrients in by

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.920 
get those additional nutrients in by
widening<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:07.160> supply<00:01:07.520> lines<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.570> supply

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
widening the supply lines the supply

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.840 
widening the supply lines the supply
lines<00:01:09.200> are<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> blood<00:01:09.710> vessels<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:10.670> may

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
lines are the blood vessels they may

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.279 
lines are the blood vessels they may
start<00:01:11.149> out<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:11.509> this<00:01:11.539> but<00:01:11.990> then<00:01:12.140> they

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
start out like this but then they

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.100 
start out like this but then they
enlarge<00:01:13.039> like<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:14.030> bring<00:01:14.149> so<00:01:14.750> much<00:01:14.869> more

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
enlarge like that to bring so much more

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.680 
enlarge like that to bring so much more
supplies<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.619> nutrients<00:01:16.250> in<00:01:16.690> additional

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
supplies and nutrients in additional

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.990 
supplies and nutrients in additional
blood<00:01:17.869> means<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.590> skin<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:19.009> redder<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.580> so

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
blood means the skin is redder and so

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.710 
blood means the skin is redder and so
you<00:01:20.090> see<00:01:20.300> this<00:01:20.479> redness<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.800> persists

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
you see this redness and it persists

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.719 
you see this redness and it persists
when<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.840> repair<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.200> finished<00:01:24.709> the<00:01:25.369> supply

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
when the repair is finished the supply

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.160 
when the repair is finished the supply
lines<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.209> blood<00:01:26.420> vessels<00:01:26.780> should<00:01:26.810> shrink

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
lines the blood vessels should shrink

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.199 
lines the blood vessels should shrink
back<00:01:27.380> down<00:01:27.440> so<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.399> redness<00:01:28.670> goes<00:01:28.759> away<00:01:29.149> but

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
back down so the redness goes away but

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.089 
back down so the redness goes away but

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
you know something those blood vessels

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.850 
you know something those blood vessels
often<00:01:32.090> offer<00:01:32.539> klimt<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.170> they<00:01:33.319> don't<00:01:33.679> know

they're<00:01:34.009> supposed<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.399> get<00:01:34.550> smaller<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.240> they

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
they're supposed to get smaller and they

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.109 
they're supposed to get smaller and they
remain<00:01:35.990> enlarged<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.490> extra<00:01:37.819> blood<00:01:37.970> that
