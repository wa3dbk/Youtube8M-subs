00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 5 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.840
 a Sunday that I propose not to give 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.020
 a new texture that is that of simple 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.090
 kraft and well you know the credits 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 to the developer good not to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.079
 developer but to the one who is contributing 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.579
 the texture to minecraft pib and that is in 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.989
 the description of the video what has 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.529
 mentioned also from twitter that I have 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.540
 is the blog launcher pro 1.6 points 2 that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.070
 You can already get it in taringa 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.840
 I leave my post in the description of the video 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.410
 is the last version that came out just 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
 today and good and with another correction 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.379
 of book but he also wanted to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.269
 mention one more thing before 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.530
 continue those who do not let them walk 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.289
 or move the only thing they have to do 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.809
 is to go options and activate this option 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.749
 of play which touch is here 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.670
 because sometimes in the blog they were 7 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.989
 cracia and you deactivate that option and what 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.879
 it does is that it does not work the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.319
 touch and well after saying that then 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.370
 let's start with the revision of the 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:07.580
 textures we start with fungi and 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.930
 all the little trees the little plants all 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.090
 almost everything has the texture 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 changed to simple kraft 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 is an extra that closely resembles the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 cd has no paintings I do not know why 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 he always forgets this same 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.289
 developer put good paint this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.569
 same to the same person who is 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.170
 contributing to the magrabi the sheep either 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.990
 as in the ducÃ³ craft and neither the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.909
 platoon to this one here that is the leader 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.579
 the reactor is the reactor here in make up 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.289
 in and well let's go in for what 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.209
 are the pickman not to change the 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.799
 texture but today but I think everything 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.959
 everything changes the texture 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.000
 they need well this they corrected the 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.799
 problem as for the zombies the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.439
 skeletons look good is not there's no 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.509
 no problem and the zombies I do not know 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.299
 look good here are the clippers that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.569
 they are greener than the green green common 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.610
 chinga me the eye and the zombies that then 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.049
 in this texture they do not have no book 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.090
 like in the trick craft I think so 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.890
 they had but good I give but since then 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.119
 spiders are here this is simple and I think 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.789
 that the only one that does is more than anything 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.890
 not later does not make you a lot 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.829
 colors in the texture only uses a 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 simple color with zero that's just a 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.170
 color the cow of its colors is only a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.010
 color or do not handle it like 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.890
 the colorado of the colors is not but I 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.590
 understand more than the Danish and then here 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.030
 the chest the stone breaker look 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.370
 well there is no problem with it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.580
 here are all the wool all 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.819
 the mats are in the minerals 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.800
 removable from what the earth is or 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.010
 of the mines so to speak with their 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.110
 respective blocks and straw the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.850
 cobweb the stairs all types 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.890
 of stone 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.140
 that can be tweaked which are the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.980
 four different times of wood the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.330
 sand what is the bricks the stone 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.940
 of rock wool its its bricks 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.950
 bricks the black what are those the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.670
 obsidian and this last one that is the stone 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.840
 mother or the stone the last one not the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.300
 work of the earth which can not be 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.370
 destroy in normal mode the beach and the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.240
 that is free because that is how 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.530
 the texture is observed in what is this 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.980
 in mode 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.069
 activated the graphic fancy and those of drum 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.959
 those who are those or are not called where 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:34.100
 they are but yes they are good I think so 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.100
 what are 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.200
 I think the habanos are the radishes 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.280
 I just remember and well then that 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.600

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.360

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.150
 It works if you can not enter post 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.800
 have only believe an account do not be 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.210
 lazy 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.920
 I know they do not like many but not 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.930
 I can put a direct link and I've already 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.940
 said then they put me out and they put me 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.200
 Strike yourselves not the creators 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.000
 of content but yourselves the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.830
 subscribers later because they do not like 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.210
 something that I say denounced my videos and 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.920
 that's why they end up putting me 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.780
 extract a cut of is not that easy but 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.130
 Well, that's why it happened to me and that's why 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.380

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.550
