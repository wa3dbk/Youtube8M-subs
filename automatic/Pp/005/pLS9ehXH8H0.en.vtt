00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.660
 hello everybody youtube this is more one 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.760
 video that I've been bringing about 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.430
 engine that pepe né 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.750
 is an engine and was developed by 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.750
 Do not you guys have a change? 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.360
 different methodology in evaluating this 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.080
 type of engine but what matters to 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.620
 people at the moment is the efficiency of the engine 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.460
 consumption the benefits that this engine 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.590
 Can you bring us back to humanity? 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.650
 then how does my channel relate to 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.830
 energy technologies is consumption of 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.100
 energy and energy production 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.270
 I came to bring you this cap. 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.590
 motors né 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.150
 is an engine made by magnets and is 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.080
 which is generated by pulses 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.770
 magnetic resonance creates a well is 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.320
 this engine here it has a lot of consumption 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.590
 how you must have seen the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.400
 beginning of the video it is no more than 20 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.340
 Watts 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.640
 it is very difficult to reach 24 and has the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.160
 same efficiency as a fan of 14 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.060
 5 of 40 centimeters 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.200
 only before I had done some time 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:10.830
 régis suite that is not ideal is next to the 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.430
 axis we have this photo transistor here that 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:18.330
 is composed of led and a traffic is 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.490
 when that this little pearl he cuts 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.790
 I had to go back and see you. 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.030
 with it it cuts from the center and if photo 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:32.669
 transistor is what happens 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:36.330
 it cuts off the current coming from the circuit 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.910
 and then it opens and closes the 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.610
 circuit all the time it cuts and 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.640
 This polarizes then cut polarizes 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.910
 movement makes the brothers they are 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.100
 spin at high speed 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.460
 So you talked a little bit about this 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:59.729
 component here it replaces 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:03.599
 is to open and close the retweet well then 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:06.539
 I decided to put together a circuit that they 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.639
 use to be able to switch and 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.310
 replace retweet 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.410
 besides the will you're calling in your 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.660
 home outlet 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.699
 well this board is interesting 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.690
 because it has some components here 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:23.669
 that surprised me and did not know that 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.539
 is this term I'm here that did not register 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.880
 cold that the colder it has 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:35.490
 environment or circuit 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:39.150
 he has his resistance is increased and 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:44.669
 the warmer it decreases its 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:46.500
 resistance and has a 2015 circuit 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.960
 people here have a capacitor of 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.229
 filter that is to transform the current 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:58.340
 alternating current in direct current reaches 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:07:04.020
 160 volts here is 111 transistor is 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:07.740
 that in fact this transistor here he 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.280
 It's a fat one has 11 gold of 600 volts 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:15.240
 which is to make circuit protection 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.530
 because it echoes in the exchange when it cuts 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.270
 attention here 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:24.780
 the coil has a holding peak that 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.389
 comes close to 400 volts and these 400 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.729
 roth can burn the circuit may not 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.250
 would burn the circuit did not have this 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:34.349
 Here protection circuit here is who 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.440
 asks that you want this kind of tension 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:41.460
 returns to the circuit and comes to 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.880
 plaquinha then the staff stays there 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.870
 a video is more a reproduction bringing 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.860
 for you 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:52.289
 this technology is not widespread in 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.900
 Portuguese actually has a lot in 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:58.590
 English plus for us almost no 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.529
 information there by videos then there is 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.779
 Did you like the video and a like? 

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:05.849
 subscribe to the channel that we will have 

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:08.779
 news then a big hug 

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:08.779
 and stay with God
