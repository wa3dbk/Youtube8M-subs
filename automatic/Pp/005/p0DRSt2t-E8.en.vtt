00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
all right welcome to part 2 of set for

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.140 
all right welcome to part 2 of set for
2004<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:10.160> telehandler<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
2004 and this is the telehandler and the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.870 
2004 and this is the telehandler and the
telehandler<00:00:12.900> has<00:00:13.170> far<00:00:14.009> less<00:00:14.040> functionality

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
telehandler has far less functionality

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.040 
telehandler has far less functionality
than<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.590> backup<00:00:18.199> but<00:00:19.220> still<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.460> neat<00:00:20.670> build

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
than the backup but still a neat build

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.950 
than the backup but still a neat build
nonetheless<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.630> these

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
nonetheless so you can see this these

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.480 
nonetheless so you can see this these
are<00:00:25.080> actually<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.380> back<00:00:25.680> wheels<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.369> I'm

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
are actually the back wheels that I'm

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.880 
are actually the back wheels that I'm
turning<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.410> tell<00:00:28.650> they're<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
turning and you can tell they're the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
turning and you can tell they're the
back<00:00:29.070> wheels<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:30.529> this<00:00:31.969> here<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> where

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
back wheels because this here is where

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540 
back wheels because this here is where
the<00:00:34.410> driver<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.980> says<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the driver would says so this is a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.100 
the driver would says so this is a
steering<00:00:36.000> wheel<00:00:36.030> where<00:00:36.480> he<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.930> all

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
steering wheel where he would have all

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
steering wheel where he would have all
the<00:00:37.230> controls<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.670> other<00:00:38.820> functionality

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the controls and the other functionality

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.310 
the controls and the other functionality
I'll<00:00:39.809> show<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> from<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.500> side<00:00:42.260> there's<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
I'll show you from this side there's a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
I'll show you from this side there's a
knob<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:45.510> twist<00:00:47.059> lower<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
knob here that will twist lower that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.299 
knob here that will twist lower that
down<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:51.020> put<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> handle<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.770> scoop

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
down and put the handle you can scoop

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.930 
down and put the handle you can scoop
and<00:00:54.350> then<00:00:55.350> twist<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> knob<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.550> bring<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and then twist the knob and bring it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
and then twist the knob and bring it
back<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.329> and<00:01:00.410> then<00:01:01.410> bring<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.039> you've

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
back up and then bring what you've

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
back up and then bring what you've
scooped<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> place

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
scooped to where you would like to place

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.050 
scooped to where you would like to place
it<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.560> boom<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.460> those<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> three

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it and boom so those are the three

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.510 
it and boom so those are the three
components<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.760> this<00:01:11.760> lever<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.360> top<00:01:13.520> see

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
components one is this lever up top see

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.070 
components one is this lever up top see
how<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.700> works<00:01:16.549> second<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:19.049> knob<00:01:21.080> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
how that works second is this knob that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.550 
how that works second is this knob that
raises<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> lowers<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> third<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
raises and lowers and the third is the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
raises and lowers and the third is the
steering<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.900> rear-wheel<00:01:33.900> steering<00:01:38.150> can<00:01:39.150> see

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
steering the rear-wheel steering can see

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.109 
steering the rear-wheel steering can see
some<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.430> gears<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> steering

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
some of the gears for the steering

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.370 
some of the gears for the steering
column

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.469 

like<00:01:48.159> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.759> can<00:01:51.939> see<00:01:52.210> how<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
like that you can see how the

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.350 
like that you can see how the
functionality<00:01:53.259> works<00:01:54.090> somewhat<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.329> the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
functionality works somewhat on the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.469 
functionality works somewhat on the
inside<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:56.259> we<00:01:56.560> raise<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.390> scoop<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.270> lower

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
inside as we raise the scoop and lower

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.149 
inside as we raise the scoop and lower
back<00:02:01.810> down<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:04.110> from<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.289> front<00:02:05.679> with<00:02:06.009> the
