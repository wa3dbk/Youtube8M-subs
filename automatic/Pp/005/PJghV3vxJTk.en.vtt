00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.960
 this team an incredible team in 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.339
 goal as you see I have marchetti 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.659
 I had doubts and put marchetti down 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.400
 to mic the two are working very well 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.869
 well lately to finally put to 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.640
 marchetti and the truth has worked for me 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.340
 pretty good I think they are from the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.899
 best goalkeepers of the entire game and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.450
 possibly the best goalkeeper of the 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.700
 Defense series of four for constan 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.710
 cáceres bonucci and with code 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.119
 very good defenses the sides are 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.460
 quite similar the two have 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.649
 quite strong especially with elbow are 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.939
 fast defend very well go well 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.799
 above and also at the time of uploading 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.750
 attack can surprise you and mark them 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.909
 some goal and then in the middle of the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920
 defense I have bonucci and cáceres two 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.740
 players that work very well in addition 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.479
 if you want to go out with the ball played, 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 you will have no problem because being 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.740
 the two of the juve do not fail almost any 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.329
 pass in the same defensive center I have 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.460
 to guarín a player that can work 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.810
 in any position in the center of the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.880
 field is a player that has 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.200
 very good statistics defends very 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.520
 well and then also at the time of uploading 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.289
 The attack also does very well done 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.630
 some passes and the shot he has is very 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.789
 very powerful by the bands two players 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.950
 very fast gunsmiths and squares together 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.200
 Colombians also that I like 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.959
 much in the only difference that I have 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.729
 among them is that square a little more 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.650
 fast that armorer and that armorer has a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.090
 better shot than square 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.319
 then in the offensive midfielder I have 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.360
 ajam singh a player who has 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.590
 delighted I find it incredible in a 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 player who has a shot from the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.430
 front and from further away even 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.290
 incredible and inside the area is lethal 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.880
 like feet the ball with this guy inside 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.500
 of the area or on the fence 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.120
 with the right leg has a cannon 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.220
 incredible I assure you, you will see it in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.710
 goals is a past technique and then 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.260
 they also make very good assistances and 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.540
 up front incredible ibarbo and 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.040
 mario gómez in this in this team has 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.060
 worked better and bargo but the truth 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.640
 is that mario gómez is a striker 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.440
 incredible and new brutal statistics 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.480
 and it seems to me that this year is not 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.740
 deserves does not have all the merit or 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.420
 everything that should be used is not used 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.890
 use now I think lately I do 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.800
 that is being used a lot 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.900
 has brutal techniques 86 on average 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.010
 it's a past, its rhythm is greater than 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.470
 put in your letter because you have a 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.320
 acceleration a sprint speed of 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.520
 84 what makes accelerating maybe 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.860
 it costs a bit but when it catches 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.470
 speed is a pass is very fast its 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.840
 shot is a pass and it goes very well for 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.870
 up and by your side ibarbo a player 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.610
 that has worked incredibly well 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.770
 As you can see, he has scored a lot of goals 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.320
 in a few games more than double the goals 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.410
 and nothing is a player that has 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.090
 worked very well is very fast is very 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.860
 strong and also you can also 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.140
 surprise and mark you score some goal 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.540
 up so do not guys here 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.250

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.870

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.579
