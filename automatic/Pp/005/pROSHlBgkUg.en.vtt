00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.689
 Hello everyone, Murazor so today 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.810
 I finally got to the tiger tanchiki 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.300
 I bought another in patch 8 and 7 of course not 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.400
 skated even in the top, he did not take away because 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 that I had strong doubts worth 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.740
 whether that is how you know so many 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 very Germans remade in patch 88 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.230
 many have altered so do not like 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 I do not like it at all suppose there to-t 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.839
 Jagdar to you generally ponerfili rather there 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.230
 review cut something else here but the tiger 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.690
 tiger is a completely different song I planted 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 on the tank 2 perks crew and rushed into battle 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.210
 This is the first fight that I even sat on 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.460
 tigre that way tiger cut down a little 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 engine power that's not it 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.100
 Critical as for a ride here the tank is lost 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 of course but not much improved 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
 mobility most important further 40 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.369
 kilometers per hour also improved 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 rate of fire and a little better 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.210
 intelligence 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.009
 here is the information to do this but here 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.679
 rate of fire is just a song now 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.069
 tanks have better dpm at the level and one of 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:22.830
 best in general now the chair is not heavy 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.800
 seventh there eighth level in general any 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.539
 tank eight is suffering from a tiger now 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.780
 just unreal especially if you give 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:34.170
 he come close to him he just you 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 on gpm u will disassemble the 1500s now have a tank 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.660
 This is how Ia's third agree 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.520
 not bad yes the tank has no special armor but 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.610
 because of such a wiki 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 rate of fire recharge takes 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 3.6 seconds that is while from and speak out of 3 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.429
 from the first there 2 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.190
 tad even 3 shoots once you 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.950
 shoot two times planted on a harp and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.860
 all history of toxic tiger 88 that is, 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.509
 enemies simply do not have any chances that 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.319
 either you make the main thing to play 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.619
 caution because having a stock of 1500 hp 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.569
 Well, you start to get garbage to suffer 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.489
 then I lost half and already in this 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.780
 the battle 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.239
 practically did not do anything but 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.040
 like nothing and did two thousand damage i 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.200
 already 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.150
 it is already a very good result 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.159
 beat your hp on the tank 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.859
 Well, as for the average player, this is already 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.620
 fine now against me 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.480
 enemy kt here I wait while he 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.590
 shooting back I saw that he was not 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.049
 top tower 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.959
 This is the most important nuance. 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.909
 we throw him and I leave I know that 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.299
 his rate of fire is much worse than that 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.480
 me 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.090
 I can stupidly disassemble it in the forehead and plus 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.639
 the tank still has water on the boat 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.560
 do at least 80 millimeters you 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.230
 substitute a little forehead when you 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.810
 ride nonetheless 1000 more damage to 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.230
 flat place without losing any units of it 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.519
 These are the things I would like 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.159
 said so on open cards 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.450
 A little easier to play than on urban 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.819
 one simple reason 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.650
 Now the tiger has a very good overview. 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.310
 I do not remember how much it was before but now 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.220
 380 meters is very good especially 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.290
 Considering the fact that these were catching special 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.970
 there is no good review of enemies only 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.000
 rare tanks and they sent and 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.060
 breaking less and much less efficiency here 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.250
 you saw me m4 45 french 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.620
 shot by no chance of a car 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.319
 level eight for tigers is not at all 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 Noise, except for type 59, except that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.760
 which is good armor the rest at all 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.400
 nothing can do here pantherka 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.790
 on firepower tiger lose 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.650
 completely you generally tin from the enemy 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.660
 the tiger gathered in the rear of me but he did not 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.550
 top 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.830
 he simply has no chance for anything 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.840
 do more here someone helps me 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.620
 although it would be better not to help I would still 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.780
 repelled even more damage 4200 damage already 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.660
 inflicted in this fight plus I'm still there 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.390
 I highlight the enemies and so on 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.460
 put the skill crew put 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.090
 perks all on the review that you can 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.010
 to put 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.560
 leave the martial brotherhood there to carry 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.420
 the fan is generally just no chance 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.670
 you can disassemble almost any 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.410
 eight the only thing not worth it 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.010
 get involved in frontal shootouts 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.840
 let's say with t-34 if it hides the case 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.390
 that's all like that well just not 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.190
 it is worth it, even though you have a lot 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.460
 HYIP I nevertheless the probability 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.960
 get to pierce rather small 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.700
 the remaining eights especially if you 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.800
 know exactly what you are going to pierce 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.510
 let's say erase it there bard even in 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.120
 forehead make their way without problems 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.220
 cattle and that's how I found myself in battle 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.070
 I get involved in a fight with top tattoo 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.560
 the floor in the forehead went at each other's 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.540
 I took it apart from me and 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.990
 stayed there literally two shots 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.660
 hepe 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.500
 I just managed to figure it out and I 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.900
 set it on fire 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.320
 you make two shots while the enemy makes 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.510
 one brew and of and there and things like that 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.790
 machines they just do not have time to nothing 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.620
 do at medium ranges until they 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.980
 come down while they try on you 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.230
 hit you shoot him there and here 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.900
 only he wants to shoot yours 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.030
 hitting knocks him out of sight at all 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.810
 has no chance now against 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.600
 tiger that's just an equal fight to win 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.150
 no, that's what the developers did 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.070
 really good German tank in the seventh 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.410
 level and the tiger is now exactly like 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.450
 should have this tank and in reality 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.480
 there was such a rate of about eight 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.750
 in reality they were fired at 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.700
 tiger well, of course, the game is very 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.260
 for a long time the tiger remained the most 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.660
 servants 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.490
 what tank that was just like that 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.960
 see a very good review here i am 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.650
 retreated a bit just because i 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.720
 started shooting 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.240
 that wasnâ€™t enough time 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.370
 the same information 2 and 7 is a bit long but 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.420
 it's still better than 2 and 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.240
 9 here at the current rate of fire 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.660
 good review this tank just does not have 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.700
 equal at level and even figure eight like me 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.370
 already said for him no particular problem 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.640
 are let's say this t-34 3 but 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.590
 APLA will both of you, he would simply could not and 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.900
 do not disassemble by dpm 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.180
 he has a very long recharge 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.980
 I also make two shots while he makes 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.830
 one is still time left to 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.560
 dokinut dogonku him here so that the tiger 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.430
 it is now just gorgeous there just 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.490
 No chance 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.640
 no other sevens there fri-patches 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.950
 just no one he can not now 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.170
 do here but this fight it so it 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.810
 first fight and and then just very 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.520
 competent nastrely here but I correct now 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.350
 I had a hundred tiger statistics 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.410
 odd fights very bad stator on 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.740
 thin was right now I correct her 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.450
 and in almost every fight I put 2002 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.730
 and a half there sometimes three thousand 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.770
 damage well of course the last frag me 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.830
 under sucked enemy speak enemy 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.660
 your brew here, but this is already 3000 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.640
 net experience 3100 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.730
 I think something just awesome 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.860
 the result I have illuminated another 1,500 myself 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.530
 almost 6 thousand and also chanted 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.480
 two thousand and here's Farm 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.430
 well, surprisingly indeed 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.740
 there is still good money cheap 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.930
 shells very often shoot perfectly 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.650
 breaks through, that is, the tank is just awesome 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.380
 on the data 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.509
 cop will still ride on it right now 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.970
 one of my favorite cars think that 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:32.280
 put him on there 4 perk you some 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.150
 crew fly haste here is not 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.190
 decided 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.729
 so if you have a doubt worth and 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.289
 Tiger can buy them completely 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:41.940
 fold back because the tiger is definitely 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.310
 worth it to buy it and on it 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.889
 bend because bend now he 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.639
 maybe no doubt about it 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.919
 does not occur 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.199
 well then don't forget to like and 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:55.050
 subscribe to the channel and put more 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:57.750
 likes if you want more tank videos 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:00.800
 tiger with you was morazor thanks for
