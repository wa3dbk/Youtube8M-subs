easterly entitled Japanese
sub-machine-guns<00:00:29.980> 1922<00:00:30.980> 1945<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.620> let's<00:00:33.620> go

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
sub-machine-guns 1922 1945 and let's go

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.270 
sub-machine-guns 1922 1945 and let's go
in<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.010> take<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.309> look<00:00:34.400> at<00:00:34.610> it

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
a book called Dragons of fire which is

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.070 
a book called Dragons of fire which is
going<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.050> be<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.460> really<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.930> monumental<00:00:44.930> work

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
going to be a really a monumental work

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.440 
going to be a really a monumental work
on<00:00:45.320> Japanese<00:00:45.800> firearms<00:00:46.370> up<00:00:46.670> until<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.180> end<00:00:47.300> of

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
on Japanese firearms up until the end of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.959 
on Japanese firearms up until the end of
World<00:00:47.600> War<00:00:47.660> two<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.410> also<00:00:48.969> foreign

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
World War two and and also foreign

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.869 
World War two and and also foreign
weapons<00:00:50.149> purchased<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:50.899> used<00:00:51.079> by<00:00:51.290> Japan<00:00:51.620> and

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
weapons purchased and used by Japan and

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.119 
weapons purchased and used by Japan and
he<00:00:52.879> released<00:00:53.090> this<00:00:53.660> booklet<00:00:54.079> on<00:00:54.410> Japanese

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
he released this booklet on Japanese

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.010 
he released this booklet on Japanese
sub-machine-guns<00:00:55.610> kind<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.120> as<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.239> teaser<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
sub-machine-guns kind of as a teaser and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.229 
sub-machine-guns kind of as a teaser and
I<00:00:57.860> think<00:00:58.070> as<00:00:58.219> a<00:00:58.250> way<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.489> help<00:00:58.790> support<00:00:59.059> himself

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
I think as a way to help support himself

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.049 
I think as a way to help support himself
while<00:00:59.600> he's<00:00:59.780> writing<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.260> main<00:01:00.410> book<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.190> this

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
while he's writing the main book so this

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.610 
while he's writing the main book so this
is<00:01:02.239> really<00:01:02.390> an<00:01:02.570> excerpt<00:01:02.989> from<00:01:03.140> what<00:01:03.350> will<00:01:03.469> be

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
is really an excerpt from what will be

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.010 
is really an excerpt from what will be
his<00:01:03.710> final<00:01:03.950> book<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:05.000> covers<00:01:05.390> some<00:01:05.600> really

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
his final book and it covers some really

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.700 
his final book and it covers some really
interesting<00:01:07.240> submachine<00:01:08.240> guns<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:09.020> you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
interesting submachine guns that I you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.600 
interesting submachine guns that I you
know<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.830> don't<00:01:10.039> know<00:01:10.100> about<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.340> but<00:01:10.490> I'd

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
know I don't know about you but I'd

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.460 
know I don't know about you but I'd
never<00:01:10.820> heard<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.149> these<00:01:11.300> things<00:01:11.570> these<00:01:11.899> most

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
never heard of these things these most

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.560 
never heard of these things these most
of<00:01:12.590> these<00:01:12.680> were<00:01:12.890> entirely<00:01:13.399> new<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.820> me<00:01:13.940> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
of these were entirely new to me and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.300 
of these were entirely new to me and
it's<00:01:14.750> really<00:01:15.020> cool<00:01:15.500> when<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:15.740> can<00:01:15.890> find<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.160> book

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's really cool when I can find a book

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.870 
it's really cool when I can find a book
like<00:01:16.490> that

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
like that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.789 
like that
so<00:01:18.310> most<00:01:19.310> people<00:01:19.580> aren't<00:01:19.700> aware<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.799> did

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
so most people aren't aware of the did

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.550 
so most people aren't aware of the did
the<00:01:22.180> pre-production<00:01:23.560> experimental

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
the pre-production experimental

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.469 
the pre-production experimental
prototype<00:01:24.950> versions<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.000> Japanese

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
prototype versions of the Japanese

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.109 
prototype versions of the Japanese
submachine<00:01:26.930> guns<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.290> were<00:01:27.409> developed<00:01:27.650> and

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
submachine guns that were developed and

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.310 
submachine guns that were developed and
he<00:01:29.119> does<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.299> really<00:01:29.570> good<00:01:29.810> job<00:01:29.869> here

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
he does a really good job here

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.649 
he does a really good job here
identifying<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.250> different<00:01:31.580> models<00:01:31.909> yeah

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
identifying the different models yeah

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.920 
identifying the different models yeah
he's<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:33.380> look<00:01:33.799> really<00:01:34.009> cool<00:01:34.930> identifying

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
he's just look really cool identifying

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.800 
he's just look really cool identifying
the<00:01:36.049> different<00:01:36.380> models<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.600> when<00:01:38.600> they<00:01:38.750> were

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
the different models and when they were

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.590 
the different models and when they were
built<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.290> what<00:01:39.500> was<00:01:39.850> what<00:01:40.850> was<00:01:41.000> interesting

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
built and what was what was interesting

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.230 
built and what was what was interesting
about<00:01:41.689> them<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.110> why<00:01:42.229> they<00:01:42.409> were<00:01:42.530> changed<00:01:43.240> for

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
about them and why they were changed for

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.780 
about them and why they were changed for
example<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.930> bunch<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.890> early<00:01:46.220> versions<00:01:46.369> of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
example a bunch of the early versions of

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.969 
example a bunch of the early versions of
the<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.240> Japanese<00:01:47.630> what<00:01:48.350> would<00:01:48.619> eventually

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the the Japanese what would eventually

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.030 
the the Japanese what would eventually
become<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.670> type<00:01:49.850> 100<00:01:50.329> used<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.530> pneumatic

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
become the type 100 used a pneumatic

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.890 
become the type 100 used a pneumatic
buffer<00:01:52.460> system<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.090> allowed<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.509> vary

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
buffer system that allowed you to vary

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.560 
buffer system that allowed you to vary
the<00:01:54.079> rate<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.350> fire<00:01:54.530> by<00:01:55.400> adjusting<00:01:56.150> how<00:01:56.420> much

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
the rate of fire by adjusting how much

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.600 
the rate of fire by adjusting how much
air<00:01:56.840> could<00:01:57.079> get<00:01:57.229> in<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.590> out<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.250> recoil

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
air could get in and out of the recoil

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.120 
air could get in and out of the recoil
buffer<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.149> how<00:01:59.479> quickly<00:01:59.750> which<00:02:00.439> is<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.649> neat

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
buffer and how quickly which is a neat

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.980 
buffer and how quickly which is a neat
system<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.030> some<00:02:02.299> other<00:02:02.360> guns<00:02:02.630> used

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
system that I think some other guns used

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.200 
system that I think some other guns used
but<00:02:03.350> wasn't<00:02:04.310> something<00:02:04.610> I'd<00:02:04.820> really<00:02:05.030> looked

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
but wasn't something I'd really looked

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.300 
but wasn't something I'd really looked
into<00:02:05.509> before<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.259> it's<00:02:06.500> really<00:02:06.829> interesting

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
into before so it's really interesting

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.729 
into before so it's really interesting
to<00:02:07.430> see<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.610> used<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.840> some<00:02:09.229> Japanese

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250

submachine<00:02:13.730> gun<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.000> was<00:02:14.120> adopted<00:02:14.360> by<00:02:14.690> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750

Japanese<00:02:15.200> military<00:02:15.459> was<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.489> type<00:02:16.940> 100<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
Japanese military was the type 100 and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.910 
Japanese military was the type 100 and
there<00:02:17.780> were<00:02:17.840> two<00:02:18.049> different<00:02:18.350> versions<00:02:18.500> and

there were two different versions and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.890 
there were two different versions and
fairly<00:02:19.579> early<00:02:19.700> war<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.299> then<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> light<00:02:20.690> war

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
fairly early war and then a light war

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.619 
fairly early war and then a light war
version<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.380> he<00:02:21.500> discusses<00:02:21.980> both<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.459> those

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
version and he discusses both of those

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.710 
version and he discusses both of those
so<00:02:23.629> this<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:25.489> production<00:02:26.000> quality<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.599> this
