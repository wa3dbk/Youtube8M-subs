yeah that's blue well actually it's
purplish<00:03:02.410> blue<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.489> say<00:03:04.180> it's<00:03:04.300> more<00:03:04.420> purple<00:03:04.930> so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
purplish blue I say it's more purple so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.430 
purplish blue I say it's more purple so
yep<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:06.550> now<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.760> bottom<00:03:07.120> obviously<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:08.260> is

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
yep and now the bottom obviously this is

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.680 
yep and now the bottom obviously this is
great<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.790> meant<00:03:10.090> for<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.390> zero-g

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
great for this it's meant for the zero-g

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:21.560 
great for this it's meant for the zero-g
Stadium<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.870> circle<00:03:13.870> flat<00:03:20.040> circle<00:03:21.040> flat

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
Stadium the circle flat circle flat

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.660

alright so next we have the same old

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.060 
alright so next we have the same old
ripcord<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:30.299> I'll<00:03:31.299> show<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.810> since<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.830> is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
ripcord so I'll show you it since it is

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.900 
ripcord so I'll show you it since it is
a<00:03:33.810> new<00:03:34.810> launcher<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.430> not<00:03:36.640> seen

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
a new launcher that we have not seen

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.930 
a new launcher that we have not seen
before

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.220 

all<00:03:44.940> right<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.300> here<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.810> compact

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
all right so here is the compact

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.630 
all right so here is the compact
launcher<00:03:47.840> it's<00:03:48.840> blue<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.000> lot<00:03:51.120> smaller

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
launcher it's blue it's a lot smaller

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.410 
launcher it's blue it's a lot smaller
obviously<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:54.030> tool<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.690> built<00:03:55.050> into<00:03:55.380> it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
obviously the tool is built into it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:08.090 
obviously the tool is built into it
there<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.840> then<00:04:04.340> well<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:07.380> actually<00:04:07.500> spins<00:04:07.950> a

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
there and then well it actually spins a

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.460 
there and then well it actually spins a
bit<00:04:08.250> more<00:04:08.400> once<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.730> let<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:08.970> go

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
bit more once you let it go

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.550 
bit more once you let it go
that's<00:04:10.470> cool<00:04:10.710> that<00:04:10.770> feels<00:04:11.160> really<00:04:11.340> nice<00:04:12.000> I

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
that's cool that feels really nice I

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.349 
that's cool that feels really nice I
like<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.740> launcher<00:04:14.510> cool<00:04:15.799> also<00:04:16.799> launcher

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
like this launcher cool also launcher

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:35.230 
like this launcher cool also launcher
put<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.480> back<00:04:18.660> there

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.210 

so<00:04:36.240> obviously<00:04:36.720> somewhere<00:04:37.410> if<00:04:37.620> red<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.860> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
so obviously somewhere if red is the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.150 
so obviously somewhere if red is the
Pegasus<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:39.090> these<00:04:39.300> energy<00:04:39.690> series<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.860> we'll

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
Pegasus of these energy series so we'll

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.270 
Pegasus of these energy series so we'll
start<00:04:41.400> with<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.670> face<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:43.290> stone<00:04:43.950> face

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
start with the face the stone face

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.580 
start with the face the stone face
obviously<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.420> different<00:04:45.840> shape<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.320> it

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
obviously it's a different shape and it

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.580 
obviously it's a different shape and it
is<00:04:46.770> longer<00:04:47.240> that's<00:04:48.240> purple<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:50.210> chrome<00:04:51.210> will

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
is longer that's purple the chrome will

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.570 
is longer that's purple the chrome will
which<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.620> super<00:04:53.130> shiny<00:04:54.140> chrome<00:04:55.140> wheel<00:04:55.580> it's

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
which is super shiny chrome wheel it's

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.330 
which is super shiny chrome wheel it's
nice<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.390> lot<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.080> detail<00:04:58.470> into<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.890> it's<00:04:59.130> kind

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
nice a lot of detail into that it's kind

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.740 
nice a lot of detail into that it's kind
of<00:04:59.370> got<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> face<00:04:59.880> there<00:05:00.740> that's<00:05:01.740> cool<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.910> the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
of got a face there that's cool and the

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.420 
of got a face there that's cool and the
crystal<00:05:04.410> will<00:05:04.530> right<00:05:04.950> here<00:05:07.220> it's<00:05:08.220> got<00:05:08.400> a

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
crystal will right here it's got a

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.630 
crystal will right here it's got a
little<00:05:10.130> flame<00:05:11.419> fire<00:05:12.419> symbol<00:05:12.870> over<00:05:13.140> there<00:05:13.640> so

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
little flame fire symbol over there so

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.060 
little flame fire symbol over there so
that's<00:05:14.760> cool<00:05:15.169> now<00:05:16.169> I'll<00:05:16.560> show<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.830> two

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
that's cool now I'll show you the two

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.260 
that's cool now I'll show you the two
modes<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.540> mode<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:19.110> called<00:05:19.380> chrome<00:05:20.010> up

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.110 

where<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.570> chrome<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.930> on<00:05:25.080> top<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.530> then<00:05:26.280> for

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
where the chrome is on top and then for

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.970 
where the chrome is on top and then for
the<00:05:27.810> next<00:05:28.380> mode<00:05:28.590> which<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:30.620> crystal<00:05:31.620> up<00:05:31.710> you

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
the next mode which is crystal up you

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.530 
the next mode which is crystal up you
simply<00:05:32.490> just<00:05:32.700> switch<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.270> other<00:05:33.390> way

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
simply just switch it the other way

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.290 
simply just switch it the other way
because<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.590> track<00:05:34.890> will<00:05:35.100> fit<00:05:35.310> into<00:05:35.520> there<00:05:35.820> so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
because the track will fit into there so

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:51.250 
because the track will fit into there so
I'll<00:05:36.690> put<00:05:36.900> this<00:05:37.020> together

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:06:14.590 

well<00:05:51.410> this<00:05:51.760> it<00:05:52.760> should<00:05:53.150> work<00:05:54.280> maybe

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600
