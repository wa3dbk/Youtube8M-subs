of the games industry and focus more on
maybe<00:04:56.360> gambling<00:04:57.360> because<00:04:57.690> maybe<00:04:58.380> they<00:04:58.590> look

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
maybe gambling because maybe they look

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.710 
maybe gambling because maybe they look
at<00:04:58.920> that<00:04:59.070> as<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> better<00:05:00.090> market<00:05:00.540> for

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
at that as a better market for

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.320 
at that as a better market for
profitability<00:05:01.260> than<00:05:01.860> games<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.400> if<00:05:03.120> that's

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
profitability than games and if that's
