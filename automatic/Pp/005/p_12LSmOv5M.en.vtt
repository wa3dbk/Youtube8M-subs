down<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> description<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.480> think<00:00:24.779> he<00:00:24.869> was

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
down the description and I think he was

one<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> only<00:00:25.350> people<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.099> was

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
one of the only people really it was

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.650 
one of the only people really it was
driving<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> cockpit<00:00:27.240> camera

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
especially in the classic car so I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.250 
especially in the classic car so I
wanted<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> show<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.080> didn't

awesome<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:09.960> sliding<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
awesome to see them sliding around the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
awesome to see them sliding around the
track<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> second<00:01:12.390> gear<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
track and in first and second gear it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
track and in first and second gear it's
quite<00:01:12.990> hard<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> control<00:01:13.890> wheel<00:01:14.250> spin

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
quite hard to control wheel spin

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.130 
quite hard to control wheel spin
especially<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> slow<00:01:15.420> corner<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
especially out of a slow corner and you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.310 
especially out of a slow corner and you
can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.450> hard<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.960> keep

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
can see there it is really hard to keep

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
can see there it is really hard to keep
these<00:01:19.500> cars<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> track<00:01:20.009> especially<00:01:20.340> when

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
these cars on the track especially when

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
these cars on the track especially when
you<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.630> over<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> top<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you going a little bit over the top and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
you going a little bit over the top and
it<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> trying<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> keep<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> track<00:01:23.970> and

it is trying to keep it on the track and
it's<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.600> quite<00:01:24.990> hard<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.860> see

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it's really quite hard but you can see

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
it's really quite hard but you can see
the<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.880> arms<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.360> everything<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.960> stove

either<00:02:57.470> having<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.859> correct<00:02:58.010> come<00:02:58.400> out<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
either having to correct come out the

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.520 
either having to correct come out the
corners<00:02:59.060> because<00:02:59.389> you<00:02:59.629> can't<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.169> put<00:03:00.379> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
corners because you can't just put the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.229 
corners because you can't just put the
throttle<00:03:00.709> down<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.790> cars<00:03:02.090> especially

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
throttle down in these cars especially

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.270 
throttle down in these cars especially
when<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.840> start<00:03:02.900> turning<00:03:03.409> off<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.500> assist<00:03:03.950> it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
when you start turning off the assist it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.890 
when you start turning off the assist it
really<00:03:04.489> does<00:03:04.760> become<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.569> bit<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
really does become a little bit of a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.240 
really does become a little bit of a
handful<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.500> keep<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.769> on<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:07.010> track

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
handful to keep it on the track
