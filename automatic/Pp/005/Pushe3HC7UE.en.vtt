 very beautiful eye-catching bag is a cupboard 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.399
 so i'm always choose a typical one 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.090
 eye-catcher in your outfit that you that day 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.160
 want to show 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.360
 and then you can also cut perfectly 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.260
 it is incredibly important that you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.129
 basic okay there is the basic items here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.420

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.670
 very easy because everyone has 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 Well the basic the items is a cupboard what 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.920
 for example, the basic items are 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.470
 black or dark ff 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 shoes I've brought some 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.320
 these are heels 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.049
 but I think this is just as well black 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.060
 flat shoes are on gray lint 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.640
 pluff heels but just as they 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.229
 union and testing are basics 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.240
 that can be basic items of clothing 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.890
 I've already shown what shoes 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.829
 may also be accessories 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 so also very nice very important to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.880
 have basic passes in you go on it or 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.049
 and basic good I have two bags here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 lie and black 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.729
 basic bag and here for example that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 gray basic bag not too many colors 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.610
 just not too many frills 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.740
 quiet to the most important thing and it 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.270
 collection part of the style choose one 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.950
 typical 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.200
 for example, today I choose this one 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.000
 cold blouse a real choose one 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.740
 eye catcher in your outfit 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.600
 this is the only thing you really want to leave 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.100
 so see combine a kepie is with something 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.440
 from your basic collection 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.149
 basic collection that I have just shown 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.660
 you fancy leather pants suit you 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.660
 black pants 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.480
 combine you again with your black 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.480
 shoes 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.330
 now you see that you have two basic items 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.430
 used and a typical 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.060
 and you are ready to take it in the wash 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.060
 take color with you 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.750
 I think the black today does not matter 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.090
 from what you prefer take shoe bag 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.290
 pants or a top when you come to you 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.790
 take it easy 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.790
 and preferably performs safely
