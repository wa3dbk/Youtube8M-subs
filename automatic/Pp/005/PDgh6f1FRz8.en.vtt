going<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:39.910> worry<00:01:40.060> about<00:01:40.119> scraping<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.930> corners

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
going to worry about scraping in corners

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040 
going to worry about scraping in corners
but<00:01:41.979> also<00:01:42.220> in<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.880> frame<00:01:43.180> with<00:01:43.420> no<00:01:43.570> extra

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050

but also in the frame with no extra
bracketry<00:01:44.740> this<00:01:45.340> bike<00:01:45.670> can<00:01:45.940> go<00:01:46.150> from<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.869> petite

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
bracketry this bike can go from a petite

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.219 
bracketry this bike can go from a petite
again<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.280> tall<00:01:48.610> woman<00:01:48.880> we've<00:01:49.540> got<00:01:49.750> two<00:01:50.020> inch

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
spacing and so it's very simple to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.630 
spacing and so it's very simple to
change<00:01:53.410> this<00:01:53.650> bike<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.190> then<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.430> got

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640
