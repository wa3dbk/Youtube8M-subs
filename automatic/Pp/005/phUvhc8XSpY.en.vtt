00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.880
 Hello, people, I am bringing you a 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.920
 tutorial that was forgotten and I was 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.689
 forgot to record at the time fix 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.340
 where is the tutorial what is this the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.380
 trick and fix everything I did 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.300
 then if I forgot it then in 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.740
 today I bring it to you because it is 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.090
 pretty cool and maybe some 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.010
 interesting mechanics is worth 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.110
 modify it or do whatever you want 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.390
 it's about a potion called a cure 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.770
 more more like the final fantasy and good 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.920
 this function what it does is give us then 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.110
 a lot of believe generation but I want 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.699
 that you leave in the animation is worth what 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.670
 that is going to see right now I 'm going to do 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.410
 a little bit of damage putting me as zero 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.020
 back and I hurt myself in fact it seems to me 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.940
 Little enough to get more damage from 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.329
 here as from zero higuain I die there 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 normal 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.690
 well then when we put this position 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.500
 look at the ground I will do so for 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.290
 create better I have pacheco I know 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.190
 and attentive I take the position 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 job 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.840
 s on the ground and they are generating me 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 life but look at that on the ground 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.590
 See, I think you've seen it a lot 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 It's not a kind of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.750
 animation with armor stands that cool 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.310
 a lot because it seems like it's a halo 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.470
 of something I do not know is something strange to me 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.290
 happened a long time ago and I had it out there and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.920
 Well, it seems quite interesting to me 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.750
 fixes exists in height 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.549
 appears in height the animation you will see 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.900
 appears there are tiny blocks that 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.820
 they are making a figurine and 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.399
 while nobody regenerating but it seems 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.070
 like the typical rpg game that they have like this 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.880
 like a halo I do not know is strange 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.970
 basically this position what does 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.710
 guys is to detect the position of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.149
 invisibility that is here is worth this 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.890
 command serves to detect me is 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.899
 constantly giving 14 what is 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.820
 invisibility and 0 that is to say I am 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.009
 constantly removing then once 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.750
 have invisibility this detects that 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.299
 have visibility and emit Christ and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.030
 then all this works here 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.729
 it gives me feedback is everything here I do not 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.259
 I agreed or what I was doing is worth this 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.319
 here a block of commands over here I think 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.720
 around here good after a 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.209
 kind of commands here like this this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.640
 from here you see that they are a lot 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.310
 of paying money stands that have names 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.560
 it's called boss this is called boss too 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.390
 I think everyone calls themselves boss and then they 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.660
 they eliminate clear 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 and well, the boss is not the center 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.830
 that is created in the center and achieve others 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.810
 are being created as a result of the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.410
 center and it's pretty simple to look at what 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.890
 what have I done here 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.380
 I will create a talk of this same 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.990
 berg fix as I did to see I put 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.820
 this today I think he has not copied the whole 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.090
 Ok what I did is the following I put 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.520
 one of these then let's assume 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.800
 this is worth less a January where I do not 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.870
 I wanted perfect so now what 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 I did was change here here, it's worth 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.090
 what it does let's generate the 0.5 towards 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.690
 one side and as you see is generated there 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.890
 and we will not generate the 0.5 more towards 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.860
 another side that would be 0 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.180
 good would be 1 worth it there and 1 is generated 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.220
 for the same and then towards the other 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 side that would be negative would be 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.060
 - 0.5 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.060
 and now that would be the least one 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.879
 and now only the horizontal ones remain 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.530
 horizontal are all of xyz 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:32.180
 there are the ones on this side that you would be able to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.459
 change this here here would be a 0.5 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.019
 do not look at creating a good parallel 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.090
 like that is wrong because here it has 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.519
 attached to remove this is all here 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.799
 remove it now yes that would be English 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.230
 I would be here and I do not know I can not 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.329
 access the command the demon is good 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.269
 basically what we were changing 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.980
 those directions and then it worked 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.370
 You see they are created like this 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.129
 I have gone to see 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.250
 here that is just one missing this block 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.250
 here 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.209
 as the effect is cool but good this 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.849
 I did it a long time ago it's worth super 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.010
 simple to remember that I did it when more or 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.170
 less when they left the these armed 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.450
 remaining but I had it there I had it there 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.700
 saved the trick and I forgot to upload it 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.290
 at the time imagine a map where 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.080
 they give you a potion because it is for example 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.060
 discover more more to say goes for this 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.650
 it's worth what it does that generate life and 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.720
 you believe generates and you appear on the ground and 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.730
 then what you do on the map try 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.020
 who does not believe in this position is to say yes 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.389
 it's an adventure map because you do not give the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.160
 potion if it's a survival map so it's not 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.180
 give the necessary items to make a 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.430
 visibility position so you do not 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.540
 can have them always good because that 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.130
 is all the che che that I hope you have 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.180
 liked me the truth that molded me 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.449
 when I did it now it seems pretty 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.309
 simple but good is cool 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.389
 you could not leave commands in the 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.860
 description but I think it's pretty 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.509
 simple what I want to understand is the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.550
 mechanism that I think is pretty 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.800
 simple what it does is generate restÃ³n 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.139
 and then makes several times to fix them 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.889
 this generates the rest there is generates block 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:06.029
 of stone and now it is removed and removed and 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:09.710
 stop creating circles and nothing else not 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.710
 will open the cinema or peace 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.050
 because nothing
