00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.440
 this is a required angle because all 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.770
 these same ones 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.230
 strict angle of 90 degrees to 90 degrees 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.330
 she's gaining typed certain 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 the size here may not be to 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.960
 in relation to the pledged requirement that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 we need it because of this we immediately measure out 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.020
 This is the size and this is what we need. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.030
 by this size it means they tag 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.600
 it is strictly drunk on which it is necessary here 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.170
 long 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.220
 and here is given a hike as if by 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.680
 a little more 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.100
 that the wedge becomes clogged up then 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 when this is the bottom pounding it just 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.140
 as if temporarily and because then later 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.410
 this 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.009
 this is the bottom of the hive where it opens 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.840
 sidebar here then with this thing when 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:15.020
 here from here that we saw on the saw 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.450
 when the volume itself these internal parts 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.090
 and hulya 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.150
 these are walls there and well this is the top where here 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.240
 the sidewall is in old here and here 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.430
 corolla corps is put and here they are already on 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.210
 full of heat and puncture tires all 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 as it should be in the amount of but the channel 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.560
 strictly what size is needed 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.470
 be sure to choose the angle if large 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.409
 Kostenko is looking for and made for the walls 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.210
 a large shield is made length long 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.909
 which is as it should be here somewhere 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.009
 there is this very big smaller shields 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.710
 mean on here on a little shield but 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.650
 sure to be the original angle and 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.720
 start any 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.950
 this wall and there it is necessary 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.509
 we also have one for example 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:12.910
 most sidewall made money already 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.620
 front also also dialed on 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.980
 this front side is here cutout 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.049
 made under the borehole also she typed 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 shrinks here to pin it on 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.870
 constantly with kalachev ita 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.099
 The ends of the wall and then they made 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.280
 here are the samples 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.720
 here then the sample will go because 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.970
 anterior-posterior to anterior, upper right 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 and the samples are sampled here 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.700
 done under the frame 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.450
 at the side walls do not do there straight 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.720
 stenochki are worth a stroke cicatrization 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.670
 no problem or whoever is doing 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.110
 Here's an example of this here's the deal boards 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.510
 and whether on this if it does not contain 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.290
 So he's also the same angle selected 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.180
 That angle did not go type that size 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.910
 post here guys put the size 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.940
 for example, it is the gas that is the load nq 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.590
 it's on the other wall 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.420
 as much as we need 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.069
 here it is how many 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.940
 we will collect my here they are very long 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:31.410
 pressure on the presses here it is with itself 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:35.280
 wedge all this size which 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.910
 we must get here and so everything is done and 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.120
 for these most 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.480
 and for the housings and housings internally 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.970
 and the exterior is just the main distraction 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.970
 nothing else to invent and us
