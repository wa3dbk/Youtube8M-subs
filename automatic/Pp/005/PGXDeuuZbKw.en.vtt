want to target daily well i'll change
that<00:00:51.480> actually<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:51.870> we've<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.410> live

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that actually because we've got a live

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.080 
that actually because we've got a live
trial<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.760> method<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:55.129> on<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
trial of this method going on on the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
trial of this method going on on the
main<00:00:57.239> website<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.899> betting<00:00:58.170> school<00:00:58.440> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
there we're targeting half a percent so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
there we're targeting half a percent so
i'll<00:01:02.520> put<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:04.019> start<00:01:04.290> date

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
i'll put that in there the start date

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.940 
i'll put that in there the start date
was<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> 20th<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> 12<00:01:07.820> overachieve<00:01:09.950> that's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
was the 20th the 12 overachieve that's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
was the 20th the 12 overachieve that's
how<00:01:11.130> much<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> over<00:01:12.689> target<00:01:13.140> each

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
how much we're going to over target each

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.929 
how much we're going to over target each
day<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.100> try<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.460> ahead<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.790> ourselves

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
day to try and get ahead of ourselves

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.749 
day to try and get ahead of ourselves
should<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.689> any<00:01:15.720> young<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.560> he<00:01:17.400> losses

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
should there be any young and he losses

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.450 
should there be any young and he losses
it<00:01:17.850> along<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> way<00:01:19.430> so

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.840 

the<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.570> over<00:01:26.810> achieve<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.979> when<00:01:28.549> does<00:01:28.729> is

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
the the over achieve that when does is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.780 
the the over achieve that when does is
going<00:01:29.119> for<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.780> hundred<00:01:30.020> percent<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:31.580> she's

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
going for is a hundred percent so she's

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.850 
going for is a hundred percent so she's
looking<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.210> get<00:01:32.360> twice<00:01:32.750> her<00:01:33.350> target<00:01:33.770> every

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
looking to get twice her target every

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.420 
looking to get twice her target every
day<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.420> if<00:01:38.630> she<00:01:38.869> if<00:01:39.110> she<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.530> say<00:01:39.860> if<00:01:40.070> when

this<00:01:59.690> spreadsheet<00:01:59.990> area<00:02:00.380> over<00:02:00.590> here<00:02:00.619> we'll

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
this spreadsheet area over here we'll

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.550 
this spreadsheet area over here we'll
look<00:02:01.009> at<00:02:01.160> your<00:02:01.479> current<00:02:02.479> fund<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.259> let's<00:02:03.440> say

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
at the end of the first day we had made

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.749 
at the end of the first day we had made
a<00:02:07.340> loss<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.200> our<00:02:09.320> fund<00:02:09.619> start<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.250> hundred<00:02:10.550> pound

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
a loss so our fund start a hundred pound

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.490 
a loss so our fund start a hundred pound
let's<00:02:10.940> say<00:02:11.090> no<00:02:11.300> sits<00:02:11.660> at<00:02:12.220> 90<00:02:13.220> pounds<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:15.350> what

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
let's say no sits at 90 pounds so what

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.140 
let's say no sits at 90 pounds so what
this<00:02:15.590> will<00:02:15.739> do<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.910> will<00:02:18.790> look<00:02:19.790> at<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this will do is it will look at the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.680 
this will do is it will look at the
amount<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.290> bank<00:02:21.530> you're<00:02:21.709> supposed<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.100> have

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
amount of bank you're supposed to have

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.360 
amount of bank you're supposed to have
which<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.720> 100<00:02:24.110> pounds<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.470> fifty<00:02:24.709> pence<00:02:24.920> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
which is 100 pounds and fifty pence it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.979 
which is 100 pounds and fifty pence it
look<00:02:25.580> at<00:02:25.700> what<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.209> got<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.900> will

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
look at what you have got and it will

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.380 
look at what you have got and it will
take<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> difference<00:02:27.590> which<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.120> ten<00:02:29.120> pounds

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
take the difference which is ten pounds

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.690 
take the difference which is ten pounds
fifty<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.959> then<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.500> divide<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.980> by<00:02:31.160> 14

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
fifty and then it will divide that by 14

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.890 
fifty and then it will divide that by 14
and<00:02:32.030> each<00:02:33.019> day<00:02:33.760> also<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.880> lad<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.269> fourteenth<00:02:35.750> of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
and each day also it lad a fourteenth of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.680 
and each day also it lad a fourteenth of
that<00:02:36.019> amount<00:02:36.260> your<00:02:36.590> daily<00:02:36.920> target<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.600> you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
that amount your daily target so you

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.080 
that amount your daily target so you
catch<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.140> little<00:02:39.170> bit<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.340> rolling

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
catch up a little bit and it's a rolling

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.300 
catch up a little bit and it's a rolling
claw<00:02:41.450> back<00:02:41.660> so<00:02:41.870> every<00:02:42.110> day<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.590> does<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.100> same

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
claw back so every day it does that same

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.400 
claw back so every day it does that same
thing<00:02:43.579> it<00:02:43.730> looks<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:44.239> you've<00:02:44.360> got<00:02:44.570> takes

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
thing it looks at what you've got takes

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.350 
thing it looks at what you've got takes
it<00:02:45.530> from<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:45.769> you're<00:02:45.890> supposed<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.280> have<00:02:46.459> /

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
it from what you're supposed to have /

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.920 
it from what you're supposed to have /
14<00:02:48.019> adds<00:02:48.320> that<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.340> day's<00:02:49.549> target<00:02:50.030> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.460 

it's<00:02:53.930> it's<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:56.209> gradually<00:02:56.750> clawing<00:02:57.320> back

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
it's it's it's gradually clawing back

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.340 
it's it's it's gradually clawing back
any<00:02:57.829> loss<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.400> might<00:02:58.549> have<00:02:59.140> so<00:03:00.140> any<00:03:00.290> of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
any loss that you might have so any of

any loss that you might have so any of
those<00:03:00.470> are<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.680> settings<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.340> set

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
those are the settings you have to set

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.710 
those are the settings you have to set
and<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:01.820> all<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.360> at<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.570> end<00:03:02.690> of

2.1 and it's still the same so you can

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.640 
2.1 and it's still the same so you can
see<00:03:41.720> because<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.110> spreading<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.530> out<00:03:42.590> over

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
see because it's spreading it out over

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.100 
see because it's spreading it out over
days<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.370> because<00:03:44.740> percentages<00:03:45.740> of<00:03:47.110> small

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
days and because percentages of small

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.310 
days and because percentages of small
numbers<00:03:48.700> but<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:50.450> actually<00:03:50.600> going<00:03:50.900> up<00:03:51.110> so

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
numbers but it's actually going up so

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.360 
numbers but it's actually going up so
little<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.680> it's<00:03:51.830> not<00:03:51.950> affecting<00:03:52.310> your

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
little that it's not affecting your
