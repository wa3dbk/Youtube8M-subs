00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
price I kind of started to think to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760 
price I kind of started to think to
myself<00:00:47.700> game<00:00:48.510> developers<00:00:49.140> might<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
myself game developers might be going a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
myself game developers might be going a
little<00:00:49.920> too<00:00:50.039> far<00:00:50.370> yet<00:00:50.610> maybe<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.510> me

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
little too far yet maybe it's just me

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.939 
little too far yet maybe it's just me
but<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> guys<00:00:52.559> think

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
do you think the last of us should be

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
do you think the last of us should be
sixty<00:00:55.199> dollars<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.620> ps4<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.699> game

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
sixty dollars for ps4 and it's a game

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
sixty dollars for ps4 and it's a game
that<00:00:56.940> people<00:00:57.750> beat<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.289> ps3<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.920> mean<00:00:59.250> six

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that people beat on ps3 I mean six

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
that people beat on ps3 I mean six
million<00:00:59.820> copies<00:00:59.969> later<00:01:00.359> how<00:01:00.539> many<00:01:00.750> people<00:01:01.079> get

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
million copies later how many people get

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.039 
million copies later how many people get
about<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
about it so I think that they need to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.600 
about it so I think that they need to
really<00:01:04.320> calm<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.040> change<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> price

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really calm down and change the price

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.230 
really calm down and change the price
and<00:01:06.000> speaking<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> change<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> price<00:01:08.240> metal
