00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.440
 according to the uses as I want 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.000
 good guys good guys welcome 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.770
 at rumboxing we continue with the package that 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.510
 previously I will have done the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.310
 unboxing of a wireless and good mouse 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.640
 let's go now with this 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.640
 that it is a bluetooth headset 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:43.120
 but good they have asked me and I show it 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.510
 it's very similar to some that sell 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:52.750
 for the playstation so with something too 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.410
 not the typical serious the typical headset 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 of your serious but something like that and your denied 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.190
 to put it some way we have already 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.760
 removed everything and here we have the headset 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.790
 Here you can see the bluetooth headset 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.350
 has a button 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.210
 the more less 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.210
 this I do not know why well opened 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.320
 we go 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.360
 Well it looks like on the road has 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.480
 released but good I have returned to 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.000
 enter here we have the pieces for 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.210
 hang it on the ear 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.830
 to hang it on the right side and 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.560
 I suppose this piece will be for 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.560
 hang it on the other side 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.850
 I do not know exactly how it will go, I suppose 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.850
 well or is it a spare I do not know here to put you 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.890
 the speaker for our ear that 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.160
 enter the micro here 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.660
 and button on and off I do not know if 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.730
 is that it comes without a load or what 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.640
 here we have instructions that we 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.680
 indicates where each part is and also 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.709
 tells us how to set 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.630
 I will see if I can connect with the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.190
 bluetooth mobile assets 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.610
 I do not know if it has any kind of light 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.770
 but now that it's on there you can 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.130
 see that has a button will blink 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.760
 the sense a while and it has been lit 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.590
 now let's go to bluetooth and see if 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.590
 we get a new device 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.930
 I do not seem to be doing it 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.800
 correctly because in theory it should 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.800
 to be worth 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.490
 for any device it is a 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.910
 Bluetooth headset for play that gives 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.010
 explanations as if it is our color 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.970
 so I do not know what it is that can 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.640
 happen then 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.640
 the review we leave it here 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 and I'll try it on the playstation if 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.450
 I get it to work just 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.360
 I will comment below in the box 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.100
 comments if I forget to ask me 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.750
 I guess though it will work because 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.940
 It's not the first one they sell and that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.920
 people have not complained down then 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.890
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.050
 this a boxing 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.580
 forgive because I have not gotten 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.840
 make it work here you have the cable 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.370
 Charging me I said they are 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.840
 these mini micro usb and here the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.640
 another tip where we want it to a 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.250
 charger to the play to a usb the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.250
 computer whatever and little more 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.489
 that counted 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.620
 You already know how I will always leave you under 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.640
 online the description if at all 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.769
 will work 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.969
 I'm thinking that maybe you too 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.370
 some extra video 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:14.420
 this is boxing and another thing to do 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.160
 operate the gadget the headset and 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.150
 little more than telling you so good 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.680
 See you guys in the next one boxing 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.680
 Greetings, until next time
