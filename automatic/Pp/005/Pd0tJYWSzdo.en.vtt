00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 Hello I am the character of norton 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.080
 safety research 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.450
 Today I show them how easy it is 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.380
 the new tents from the range hammer nx 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.340
 establish 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.529
 at the tents haba haba haba haba and 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.779
 dad but nothing is going on anyway 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.899
 what you have come for a standard 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.579
 Installation requires an optional tent 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.350
 Underlay offers further setup 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.040
 options that I show you everything 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.739
 will 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.109
 at all tents from the series have nothing 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.329
 becomes a freestanding unit 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.039
 rod system with color-coded 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.079
 anchoring loops and fabric clips 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.109
 used with those who set that up 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.109
 fast and easy going they spread the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.210
 tent first if you have the optional 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.940
 use tent pad lay it 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.649
 isolated by the inside they secure the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 four corners stretched outwards 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.070
 pull through from the middle 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.720
 Now put the rod together 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.730
 Lead the tips of the two 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 Rods in the grommets with the red tissue 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.690
 at one end of the tent floor 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.360
 then the other rods in the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.580
 Eyes with gray fabric all tents 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.410
 the series but anyway nothing has a first 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.410
 stick the one in the two bad ones in the 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.670
 please put the tents 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.310
 attach the tent clips to the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 main posts or bars and at the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.410
 first pole with the dad but be counted 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.510
 additional rods with a gray 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.630
 created side over the red capital 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.130
 and their ends are in the loops with 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.650
 the gray fabric to the herring 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.680
 then put them in place 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.300
 put fabric clips on the sides of the rods 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.430
 she counts that over with the darker ones 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.400
 side of the logo pointing down over 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.650
 the inner tent 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.720
 the red fabric towards the red 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.050
 herring loops and the gray fabric 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.430
 loops towards the gray herring 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.400
 fix the middle over the tent 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.080
 nasty on the first pole at 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.480
 avantgarde counts must be taken care of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.990
 be that the velcro straps 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.490
 be attached to the main rods 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.680
 pull the entrance areas so far 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.680
 out as they are curious and the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.790
 seams are aligned with the frame 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 pull the fabric at all 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.850
 anchoring points firmly use them 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.190
 always the minimum number of herring and 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.860
 If necessary, additional credits linen and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.080
 Tension your tent and tent 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 if necessary, the entrance areas 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.220
 so that you tent tight and waterproof 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.920
 stays open by opening the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.560
 Air vents high rolling awning 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.209
 or rollback is isolated 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.090
 minimized condensation and the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.310
 Air movement promoted all tent 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.290
 Underlay will help keep the tent clean and tidy 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.190
 keep dry and it protects against 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.260
 abrasion so it stays longer than new 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.420
 all tents in the series but anyway nothing can 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.269
 using the over tent and one 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.459
 optional tent underlay from msa too 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.380
 set up in fast and light mode 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.550
 become 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.430
 secure the tent underlay 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.640
 first so the herring that the msc 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.860
 logo up then shows you stuck 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.440
 Put the bars together and add them 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.480
 in the corner evil of the tent floor around 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.570
 the same rod structure as the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.310
 standard construction 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.260
 attach the tent in which they are 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.530
 The tent fabric with the evil ones 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.120
 fasten the rod ends 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.970
 then insert the first rod into the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.230
 Ã¶sen over the doors 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.900
 Finally, secure the tent 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.489
 Tighten the tent before pulling it 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.850
 Tight and tense them 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.640
 if necessary the tents hammer nx and 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.080
 haba nx can also be in one 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.370
 lighter fast and light mode 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.610
 be set up 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.959
 in which only that over tent is used 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.269
 if the tent is set up with rules 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.070
 must be the almost and 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.650
 light mode was also the first step 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.640
 the startup then keeps that over 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.020
 tent under the tent dry 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.930
 If you were the clips on the rods 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.430
 attach no matter for which position 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.069
 Options you decide 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.730
 the tents of the series haber nx let themselves 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.660
 dismantle as easily as set up 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.640
 Just switch the rods 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.040
 together by starting in the middle 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.769
 around a wear of rod rubbers 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.390
 to keep low 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.640
 hold the tent up for a long time 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.880
 the width of her pack sachs together and 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.230
 if necessary, wipe away dirt 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.390
 Put the rods and herring in the 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.390
 middle and roll them tight 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.740
 The compression stucco has a wide 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.800
 Opening the tent 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.390
 really easy makes the pole 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.669
 also lead separately 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.950
 the pact can be folded inside and 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.020
 the tent to carry in a backpack 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.970
 attached at a compression rate 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.860
 become 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.020
 Do not store when it's wet 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.800
 or damp is because otherwise mold 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.900
 can form 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.940
 if you pack a tent damp 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.010
 should have it later as soon as 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.200
 possible to be set up for drying 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.750
 if extra space is required 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.820
 but that is true for the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.669
 models hammer and haba haba one 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.660
 twice as much storage space 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.330
 Of course, there is still a lot left 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.090
 Another accessory of msa with her 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.760
 tent becomes even more versatile 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.760
