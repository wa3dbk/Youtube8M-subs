00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.069 

huh<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> record<00:00:55.949> looks<00:00:56.280> like

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
huh so that is what a record looks like

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.180 
huh so that is what a record looks like
the<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.379> reads<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> lines<00:01:00.890> does<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> come

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the thing reads the lines does it come

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.350 
the thing reads the lines does it come
with<00:01:02.219> instructions<00:01:06.229> mmm<00:01:07.320> speed<00:01:08.360> that's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
with instructions mmm speed that's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.030 
with instructions mmm speed that's
important<00:01:09.900> isn't<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.580> 33<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> half

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
important isn't it 33 and a half

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.700 
important isn't it 33 and a half
actually<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.400> no<00:01:14.580> idea<00:01:14.610> how<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
probably shouldn't put that on the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.620 
probably shouldn't put that on the
ground<00:01:19.460> how<00:01:20.460> does<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.759> thing<00:01:20.820> work

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
