00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.200
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm a lion and I 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.759
 I'm Luciano 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 I'll show you guys today. 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.080
 how to make a base for drilling and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.570
 cut and families exactly to be 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 most first did not matter provide 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 this here is really very difficult in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 life running back and forth with 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.109
 this base is much easier no longer 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 come on as the first step to 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.980
 make this template for verification of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.440
 loads 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 You're going to bring us two straight lines. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 parallels in these woods after the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.840
 people are going to fight then the intention is to do 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 one one one 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.430
 It's okay, show channel for you to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.690
 put families 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.340
 so you can mark this with a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 rule not being eight if you do 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 a way in case has one of them already have 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.750
 a sense 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.750
 You can wear a scrim suit. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.080
 Once the risk is made, now let's 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.840
 to pass this sakineh 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.280
 right now if you need to have a 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.810
 plant if you have a utopia you 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.700
 Can we in Turkey? 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.960
 cause why not making full 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.640
 need not even connect a tool as 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.140
 that ended up in a service 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.670
 It is very simple to do 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.200
 so to regulate the full as people 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.450
 already showed a video announcing this 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.479
 hit the back you lift 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.970
 blade tapping on the front of the book 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.310
 Do you want to quit smoking? 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.440
 then you get an entirely way 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.440
 new chance to make your stuff 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 so now I have to for the next 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.390
 do this on the plant you have to follow 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.530
 come the risk is you can not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.530
 overtake here 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.789
 careful calm 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.649
 It is important for you to work with full 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.149
 manual work is to do slow and always 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.160
 noting if you are not eating more 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.769
 a side that another agent will try 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.190
 leave here what 45 degrees the fastest 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.190
 possible 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.610
 now I'll have thick in full I'll go 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.590
 start tuning trash 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.900
 Okay, I'll start yelling the cut the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.990
 government the line stay there the son still 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:50.850
 I'm watching is 12 nothing and I'll do it then. 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:54.450
 I'm just going to finish it - I got it 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.860
 make it clear that it was handmade 70 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.600
 make the most perfect possible 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.880
 the subject now to confirm to be like 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.110
 It was so crooked to the shampoo I made 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.320
 this better way 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.320
 check here the medium 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.040
 check out the little bit outside this is not 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.670
 a job that needs to be only you 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:29.340
 leaving a channel to fall will influence 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:32.160
 much in the perfection of the person 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.600
 It does not get much smoothing what you 're going 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.680
 do because otherwise you will end 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.130
 Holland and had how it will look to do 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.150
 a belly, then it needs to be very 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.070
 laugh not because it will not influence 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.019
 the future of your family 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.150
 good, it's another thing to work on 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.600
 complete also please take care 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:57.360
 attention even on wood and another reason 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.010
 also we use this and all the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 same as the surest way not 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:08.130
 Can you know what to do with force? 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.049
 rubber and is non-slip the ways 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.890
 she will need to hold on very hard 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.810
 strong 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.340
 so after you call in both 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.019
 ways we'll join the two 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.760
 screw and glue because only ask after the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.410
 movie is organized 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.630
 she stands firm here you can enter 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.100
 contact so I'll learn with four 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.810
 bolts so that these two ways 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.140
 stay well strange movie get loose 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.670
 also not good and I will not put a 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.290
 screw in the middle because the sock where I 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.940
 I will always use with the calculation 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.250
 cutting pin even then if I 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.350
 I want to carry a screw best way 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.120
 is not winning the league europa is going to ruin 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.940
 my certain disk is that since it can not 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.070
 I'll get a little strong mark and mail 24 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.750
 a little monkey 16 for example 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.350
 interesting because it does not 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.350
 existing 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.480
 I'm not going to paranÃ¡ flamengo, I 'm just gonna cry. 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.750
 because the bolt can even enter the 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.750
 guinea 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.759
 the port that was made to the base I 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.520
 I think you can give a honey finish 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.240
 then pass me by and call me Mayer is the 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.889
 old 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.629
 now on this basis is very useful for 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.159
 stick family because as the cabin is 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.949
 body support us 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.229
 her that you do not have a price to firmness 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:12.840
 completely then you like base 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.960
 Hold it tight so I'm keeping the tone. 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.960
 from the movie 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.020
 very well staff then looking did the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.099
 heart of life and now do not do the 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.289
 same process 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.250
 In the same gang I'm going to get this one. 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.020
 feedback 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.870
 I'll centralize here I did the same 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:42.080
 size of my base 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:42.080
 I will put my allowance has not improved 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.830
 a little bit cut off the province too 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.830
 a safe and very quiet way 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.290
 no no no
