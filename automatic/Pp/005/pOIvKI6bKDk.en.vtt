end let's do the double bump n a double

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.399 
end let's do the double bump n a double
bump<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.390> one<00:01:42.079> two<00:01:42.829> three<00:01:43.700> four<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.689> that's

bump is one two three four and that's
with<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.649> end<00:01:45.920> at<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.189> end<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:48.100> 1230

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
with the end at the end of that 1230

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.459 
with the end at the end of that 1230
change<00:01:49.490> beat<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.329> let's<00:01:50.479> try<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:50.960> one<00:01:51.909> two

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
change beat so let's try that one two

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
one two three four one two three change

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:16.040 
one two three four one two three change
feet<00:02:08.390> f<00:02:08.750> 1<00:02:09.709> 2<00:02:10.519> 3<00:02:10.850> 4<00:02:12.040> 1<00:02:13.040> 2<00:02:13.150> 3<00:02:14.150> change<00:02:15.079> feet

feet f 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 change feet

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.000 
feet f 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 change feet
two<00:02:16.830> three<00:02:17.640> four<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:19.140> two<00:02:19.670> three<00:02:20.670> change<00:02:21.180> feet

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
two three four one two three change feet

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.110 
two three four one two three change feet
now<00:02:23.010> we're<00:02:23.190> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.490> what's<00:02:23.730> called<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
now we're going to do what's called the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.990 
now we're going to do what's called the
m<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.130> n<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.330> M<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.880> followed<00:02:29.880> by<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> end

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
m and n to the M and followed by the end

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.480 
m and n to the M and followed by the end
so<00:02:33.000> let's<00:02:33.180> try<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.720> m<00:02:35.000> 1<00:02:36.500> 2<00:02:37.500> 3<00:02:38.450> 4<00:02:40.100> sort<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.250> stay

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
so let's try that m 1 2 3 4 sort of stay

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.790 
so let's try that m 1 2 3 4 sort of stay
on<00:02:41.640> four<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.710> one<00:02:43.710> two<00:02:44.900> three<00:02:45.900> switch<00:02:46.440> feet

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.950 
on four and one two three switch feet
good<00:02:47.790> again<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:49.580> two<00:02:50.580> three<00:02:51.110> four<00:02:52.910> one<00:02:53.910> two

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
good again one two three four one two

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.520 
good again one two three four one two
three<00:02:55.610> change<00:02:56.610> feet<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.830> one<00:02:58.830> two<00:02:59.790> three<00:03:00.720> four

two three four and one two three change

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.270 
two three four and one two three change
feet<00:03:11.960> good<00:03:12.960> now<00:03:13.650> we're<00:03:13.830> going<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.100> what's

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
feet good now we're going to do what's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.470 
feet good now we're going to do what's
called<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.640> typewriter<00:03:15.390> or<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.210> don't

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
called the typewriter or if you don't

change

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.380 

so<00:03:31.330> let's<00:03:31.510> try<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.990> one<00:03:32.319> two<00:03:33.130> three<00:03:33.670> four<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
so let's try that one two three four and
