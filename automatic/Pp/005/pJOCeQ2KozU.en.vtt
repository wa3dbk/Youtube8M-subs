crossing a body of water he's got a two
and<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> half<00:00:10.170> horsepower<00:00:10.590> motor<00:00:11.130> mounted<00:00:12.059> at

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and a half horsepower motor mounted at

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.480 
and a half horsepower motor mounted at
the<00:00:12.210> rear<00:00:12.360> he<00:00:12.960> starts<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> motor<00:00:13.620> he's<00:00:14.070> got<00:00:14.340> it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the rear he starts the motor he's got it

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
the rear he starts the motor he's got it
running<00:00:14.639> now<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.990> tractor<00:00:16.529> engine<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.980> still

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
running now the tractor engine is still

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.720 
running now the tractor engine is still
running<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.699> he<00:00:17.850> crosses<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.510> river<00:00:22.730> but

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
running as he crosses this river but

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310 
running as he crosses this river but
he's<00:00:23.850> getting<00:00:24.180> most<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.630> propulsion

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
he's getting most of the propulsion

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.779 
he's getting most of the propulsion
power<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> outboard<00:00:26.640> motor<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.180> he<00:00:27.390> goes

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
power from the outboard motor as he goes

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.890 
power from the outboard motor as he goes
you'll<00:00:29.789> notice<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.330> he's<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:30.720> running

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you'll notice that he's still running

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
you'll notice that he's still running
pretty<00:00:31.260> high<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> water<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.669> he<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.969> get

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
pretty high in the water so he can get

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.940 
pretty high in the water so he can get
two<00:00:33.329> people<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:34.020> bags<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.440> cement<00:00:34.649> in

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
two people and two bags of cement in

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.190

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619 
there along with other building
materials<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.460> topper<00:00:38.850> he's<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.390> there

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
materials the topper he's got on there

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.479 
materials the topper he's got on there
is<00:00:39.719> four<00:00:39.870> strapping<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.469> two<00:00:40.680> by<00:00:40.860> fours<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
is four strapping on two by fours and

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
is four strapping on two by fours and
other<00:00:41.700> pieces<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.329> lumber<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
other pieces of lumber you can see that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.580 
other pieces of lumber you can see that
he's<00:00:50.219> moving<00:00:50.640> along<00:00:50.969> quite<00:00:51.840> well<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
he's moving along quite well in the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.810 
he's moving along quite well in the
water<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.710> he<00:00:55.860> certainly<00:00:56.100> does<00:00:56.550> want

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
water to do that he certainly does want

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
water to do that he certainly does want
that<00:00:57.030> outboard<00:00:57.480> motor<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:58.199> he<00:00:58.379> wouldn't

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that outboard motor because he wouldn't

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:31.120 
that outboard motor because he wouldn't
get<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:58.890> far<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.699> fast<00:01:00.030> without<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.430 

he's<00:01:31.670> moving<00:01:32.120> along<00:01:32.210> well<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.690> approaching

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
he's moving along well and approaching

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.770 
he's moving along well and approaching
the<00:01:33.560> far<00:01:33.770> shore<00:01:39.580> as<00:01:40.580> he<00:01:40.850> approaches<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.540> far

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
the far shore as he approaches the far

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.620 
the far shore as he approaches the far
shore<00:01:42.370> notice<00:01:43.370> how<00:01:43.550> smoothly<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.300> tracks

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
shore notice how smoothly the tracks

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 
shore notice how smoothly the tracks
grab<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.290> he<00:01:45.440> comes<00:01:45.710> out<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.130> water<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
grab and he comes out of the water and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.570 
grab and he comes out of the water and
nothing<00:01:47.300> flat<00:01:47.570> as<00:01:47.840> smooth<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.440> can<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.070> think

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
nothing flat as smooth as can be I think

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.430 
nothing flat as smooth as can be I think
there's<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.820> point<00:01:50.119> where<00:01:50.300> here<00:01:50.540> where<00:01:51.080> he

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
there's a point where here where he

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.410 
there's a point where here where he
slows<00:01:51.800> down<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.310> shuts<00:01:52.580> off<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.000> outboard

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
slows down and shuts off the outboard

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:10.690 
slows down and shuts off the outboard
motor<00:01:53.660> first<00:02:06.910> how<00:02:07.910> about<00:02:08.360> that
