00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
things candy to have it and it's like

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.259 
things candy to have it and it's like
crushed<00:02:33.590> some<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.739> my<00:02:34.920> friends<00:02:35.340> said<00:02:36.000> no

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
crushed some of my friends said no

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.229 
crushed some of my friends said no
they've<00:02:36.569> retired<00:02:36.930> they're<00:02:37.319> not<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.769> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
they've retired they're not going to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.850 
they've retired they're not going to
they're<00:02:39.239> not<00:02:39.299> going<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:39.840> any<00:02:39.989> canning<00:02:40.530> now

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.270 

so<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:45.390> has<00:02:45.870> became<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> lost<00:02:47.010> art

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
so I think that it has became a lost art

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.420 
so I think that it has became a lost art
but<00:02:47.780> extension<00:02:48.780> has<00:02:49.110> worked<00:02:49.470> hard<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.250> get

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
but extension has worked hard to get

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.470 
but extension has worked hard to get
people<00:02:50.989> into<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.200> idea<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:53.099> it's<00:02:53.480> less

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
people into that idea that it's less

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.610 
people into that idea that it's less
expensive<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.739> better<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.849> you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
expensive and it's better for you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.589 
expensive and it's better for you
besides<00:02:58.730> extension<00:02:59.730> there's<00:02:59.940> other<00:03:00.150> people

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
besides extension there's other people

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.280 
besides extension there's other people
and<00:03:00.950> classes<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.310> encourage<00:03:03.180> people<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.959> do

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
and classes to encourage people to do

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.650 
and classes to encourage people to do
things<00:03:04.590> because<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.310> lot<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.579> them<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.000> parents

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
things because a lot of them the parents

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.990 
things because a lot of them the parents
didn't<00:03:07.049> do<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.739> how<00:03:08.010> are<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> children<00:03:08.850> are
