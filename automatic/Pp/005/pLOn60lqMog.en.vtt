00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.849 
at it and stuff and so these ones have
like<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.840> hard<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:59.149> material<00:01:00.170> around<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
like this hard like material around the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
like this hard like material around the
actual<00:01:02.340> foam<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.480> inside<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.080> here

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
actual foam that's inside of here

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.320 
actual foam that's inside of here
but<00:01:05.280> again<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.880> still<00:01:05.970> kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> soft<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
but again it's still kind of soft and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
but again it's still kind of soft and
it's<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.869> wobbly

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it's it's wobbly

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.130 
it's it's wobbly
don't<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> could<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:14.600> okay<00:01:15.600> I'll

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
don't you could see that okay I'll

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.649 
don't you could see that okay I'll
believe<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.659> doesn't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
believe it that's all good doesn't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
believe it that's all good doesn't
really<00:01:18.750> matter<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> handles<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:24.000> very

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
really matter and the handles it's very

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.060 
really matter and the handles it's very
hard

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
hard

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
hard
still<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:27.710> harder<00:01:28.710> than<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> sort<00:01:30.530> but<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
still it's harder than the sort but it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.330 
still it's harder than the sort but it
still<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.310> um<00:01:32.780> has<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> plastic<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
still is um has a plastic around it and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.490 
still is um has a plastic around it and
it<00:01:36.270> still<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:37.470> foam<00:01:37.740> inside<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it still has foam inside of it and so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.859 
it still has foam inside of it and so
the<00:01:44.210> there's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.330> an<00:01:45.810> enforced<00:01:46.500> logo<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.069> there

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
the there's a an enforced logo on there

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.070 
the there's a an enforced logo on there
don't<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:51.080> but

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
don't know if you can see that but

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.770 
don't know if you can see that but
anyways<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:55.020> good<00:01:55.259> sword<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.909> if

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
