it<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.270> people

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it so here it is the one that people

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
it so here it is the one that people
requested<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> most<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> new<00:01:46.829> shangzhou

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
requested the most was the new shangzhou

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.850 
requested the most was the new shangzhou
one<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> decided<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.290> this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
one but I decided to just go with this

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.260 
one but I decided to just go with this
because<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:50.759> they're<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
because I'm pretty sure they're all the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
because I'm pretty sure they're all the
same<00:01:51.299> quality<00:01:51.869> anyways<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:53.189> one

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
same quality anyways and this one

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
same quality anyways and this one
actually<00:01:53.759> turns<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.659> very<00:01:55.020> nicely<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
actually turns very very nicely or a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
actually turns very very nicely or a
little<00:01:55.979> bit<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> focus<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.719> now

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
little bit out of focus there so now

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
little bit out of focus there so now
let's<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.649> yeah<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.820> one

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
let's go like this yeah this this one

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.569 
let's go like this yeah this this one
actually<00:02:00.180> turns<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.140> lot<00:02:01.409> better<00:02:01.649> than<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.460> one

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
actually turns a lot better than the one

so let's go ahead and pop a piece out

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.470 
so let's go ahead and pop a piece out
and<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:17.099> what<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.340> looks<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> inside

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and see what it looks like on the inside

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.809 
and see what it looks like on the inside

oh wow
so<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.150> quite<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.870> different<00:02:25.290> this

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so this is quite a bit different this

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.759 
so this is quite a bit different this
looks<00:02:26.550> sort<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.849> like<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.030> GU<00:02:27.360> Hong<00:02:27.599> piece<00:02:27.989> or<00:02:28.290> or

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
looks sort of like a GU Hong piece or or

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.900 
looks sort of like a GU Hong piece or or
something<00:02:29.569> yeah<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.560> that's<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.700> lot

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
something yeah you see that that's a lot

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.729 
something yeah you see that that's a lot
different<00:02:33.150> than<00:02:33.510> your<00:02:33.569> standard<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.590> does

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.530 
like the stickers too I mean look at
this<00:03:29.130> sort<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.579> looks<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.849> it's<00:03:30.060> polished

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
this sort of looks like it's polished

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.690 
this sort of looks like it's polished
metal<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.739> know<00:03:31.859> so<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.160> looks<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.400> cool

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
metal you know so that looks really cool

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.800 
metal you know so that looks really cool
so<00:03:32.790> let's<00:03:32.819> go<00:03:33.000> ahead<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.209> scramble<00:03:33.690> this

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
so let's go ahead and scramble this

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.059 
so let's go ahead and scramble this
thing<00:03:34.019> up<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:36.980> see<00:03:37.980> what<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.160> looks<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:40.069> now

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
thing up and see what it looks like now

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.559 
thing up and see what it looks like now
I<00:03:41.099> don't<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.459> another<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.060> compare<00:03:42.419> this

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
I don't have another one to compare this

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.059 
I don't have another one to compare this
to<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.109> think<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.590> can<00:03:43.709> really<00:03:43.889> get

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
to but I think that you can really get

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.599 
to but I think that you can really get
the<00:03:44.220> idea

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
the idea

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.420 
the idea

the intricate puzzle let's see if I can
solve<00:04:09.599> it<00:04:09.810> really<00:04:10.410> quick<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.549> let's<00:04:11.790> put<00:04:11.970> this

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
solve it really quick so let's put this

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.069 
solve it really quick so let's put this
here<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.500> know<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:13.950> got<00:04:14.609> bored<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.209> this

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
here and I you know I got bored of this

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.789 
here and I you know I got bored of this
puzzle<00:04:16.320> before<00:04:17.280> which<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:18.109> why<00:04:19.109> I<00:04:19.139> stopped

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
puzzle before which is why I stopped

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.790 
puzzle before which is why I stopped
playing<00:04:20.250> with<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.729> I<00:04:21.409> think<00:04:22.409> this<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.770> goes

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
playing with it I think this one goes

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.510 
playing with it I think this one goes
here<00:04:23.400> what

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.650 

but<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.550> guess<00:04:27.760> it's<00:04:27.940> always<00:04:28.090> good<00:04:28.390> to<00:04:28.420> have

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
but I guess it's always good to have

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.290 
but I guess it's always good to have
another<00:04:28.840> one<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.260> your<00:04:29.380> collection<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.300> I'm

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
kind of glad I got this and plus it's

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.830 
kind of glad I got this and plus it's
like<00:04:33.100> it's<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.120> nice<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.480> solve<00:04:36.630> okay<00:04:39.840> that's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
like it's so nice to solve okay that's

in the corners this is the big one that
goes<00:04:57.700> here<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:59.740> one<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.280> know<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.120> lot<00:05:01.300> of

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
goes here and this one I know a lot of

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.910 
goes here and this one I know a lot of
people<00:05:01.600> like<00:05:01.780> oh<00:05:01.960> why<00:05:02.410> are<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.560> using<00:05:02.710> the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
people like oh why are you using the

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.530 
people like oh why are you using the
beginners<00:05:03.280> method<00:05:03.490> that's<00:05:03.970> what<00:05:04.120> people<00:05:04.240> say

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
beginners method that's what people say

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.700 
beginners method that's what people say
a<00:05:04.570> lot<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.930> time<00:05:05.080> when<00:05:05.230> I<00:05:05.260> saw<00:05:05.530> these

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
a lot of the time when I saw these

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.130 
a lot of the time when I saw these
weird-looking<00:05:06.100> puzzles<00:05:06.730> but<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.570> reason<00:05:07.960> I'm

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
weird-looking puzzles but the reason I'm

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.200 
weird-looking puzzles but the reason I'm
using<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.590> beginners<00:05:08.980> method<00:05:09.160> is<00:05:09.550> because

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
using the beginners method is because

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.360 
using the beginners method is because
it's<00:05:10.390> really<00:05:10.660> hard<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.200> do<00:05:11.380> f2l<00:05:11.980> when<00:05:12.220> you're

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
it's really hard to do f2l when you're

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.820 
it's really hard to do f2l when you're
using<00:05:12.670> you<00:05:13.330> know<00:05:13.420> weird<00:05:13.780> shapes<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.590> stuff

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
using you know weird shapes and stuff

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.740 
using you know weird shapes and stuff
like<00:05:15.010> that<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:15.640> just<00:05:15.910> kind<00:05:16.690> of

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
like that and it's just kind of

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.080 
like that and it's just kind of
difficult<00:05:17.260> to<00:05:17.350> line<00:05:18.310> things<00:05:18.610> up<00:05:18.820> properly

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
difficult to line things up properly

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.910 
difficult to line things up properly
when<00:05:19.480> there's<00:05:19.660> no<00:05:19.780> colors<00:05:20.170> to<00:05:20.470> let<00:05:20.590> you<00:05:20.740> know

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
when there's no colors to let you know

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.490 
when there's no colors to let you know
and<00:05:21.190> basically<00:05:21.970> all<00:05:22.300> this<00:05:22.390> is<00:05:22.450> is<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.690> 3x3<00:05:23.350> I

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
and basically all this is is a 3x3 I

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.480 
and basically all this is is a 3x3 I
mean<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.770> think<00:05:23.830> that's<00:05:24.040> pretty<00:05:24.250> obvious<00:05:26.130> but<00:05:27.130> I

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
mean I think that's pretty obvious but I
