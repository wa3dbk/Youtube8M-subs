the<00:02:00.720> direction<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.140> trajectory<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.800> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the direction and trajectory of that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.260 
the direction and trajectory of that
missile<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.340> he<00:02:02.430> actually<00:02:02.550> even<00:02:02.880> pulls<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
missile and he actually even pulls out a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.960 
missile and he actually even pulls out a
little<00:02:03.510> PlayStation<00:02:04.260> DualShock<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.010> and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
little PlayStation DualShock and and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.580 
little PlayStation DualShock and and
controls<00:02:06.480> it<00:02:06.630> around<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> level<00:02:07.200> mean<00:02:07.410> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
controls it around the level mean the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
controls it around the level mean the
level<00:02:07.860> 3<00:02:08.010> speaks<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.580> itself<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.119> mean<00:02:09.300> let's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
level 3 speaks for itself I mean let's

little<00:02:12.840> bit<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.959> an<00:02:13.050> odd<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.320> how<00:02:13.530> kratos<00:02:13.980> is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
little bit of an odd that how kratos is

a<00:02:14.160> level<00:02:14.700> three<00:02:14.910> works<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.390> different

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
a level three works but it's different

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.120 
a level three works but it's different
it's<00:02:16.050> got<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> chain<00:02:16.530> gun<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.890> allows<00:02:17.100> him

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
it's got the chain gun that allows him

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.970 
it's got the chain gun that allows him
essentially<00:02:17.640> full<00:02:17.970> screen<00:02:18.320> access<00:02:19.320> if<00:02:19.500> you're

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
essentially full screen access if you're

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.890 
essentially full screen access if you're
in<00:02:20.220> front<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.760> sweet<00:02:21.000> tooth<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.420> he<00:02:21.600> pops

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
in front of sweet tooth and he pops

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.480 
in front of sweet tooth and he pops
magnitude<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.650> he<00:02:22.740> starts<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.190> shangaan

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
magnitude and he starts that shangaan

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.600 
magnitude and he starts that shangaan
attack<00:02:24.140> good<00:02:25.140> luck<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.950> sum<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.490> all<00:02:26.520> up

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
attack good luck to you so sum it all up

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400 
attack good luck to you so sum it all up
to<00:02:27.030> close<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.450> book<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:27.990> sweet<00:02:28.230> tooth

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
to close the book here on sweet tooth

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.199 
to close the book here on sweet tooth
what<00:02:28.680> kind<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.370> kind<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.610> player<00:02:29.970> is

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
what kind of what kind of player is

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.240 
what kind of what kind of player is
going<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.450> gravitate<00:02:30.720> towards<00:02:31.560> sweet<00:02:31.830> tooth<00:02:32.070> I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
going to gravitate towards sweet tooth I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.220 
going to gravitate towards sweet tooth I
actually<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:33.060> sweet<00:02:33.690> tooth<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
actually think sweet tooth is one of the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.470 
actually think sweet tooth is one of the
easiest<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.730> characters<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.910> our<00:02:36.030> roster<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
easiest of characters on our roster to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.880 
easiest of characters on our roster to
play<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:36.780> maybe<00:02:37.320> if<00:02:37.470> you're<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.770> starting

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
play so maybe if you're just starting

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
play so maybe if you're just starting
out<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.580> one<00:02:38.850> except<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.140> jump

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
out and one except for that you can jump

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.960 
out and one except for that you can jump
in<00:02:40.560> very<00:02:41.070> very<00:02:41.250> quickly<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.760> some

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
in very very quickly and have some

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.759 
in very very quickly and have some
really<00:02:42.120> success<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.230> think<00:02:43.290> you'd<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.739> a

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
really success with I think you'd be a

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.440 
really success with I think you'd be a
great<00:02:43.950> choice

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.450
