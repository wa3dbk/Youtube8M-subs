over the past couple of years and

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.949 
over the past couple of years and
there's<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.400> lot<00:04:14.669> of<00:04:14.940> templates<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:15.690> know<00:04:15.720> that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.050 
there's a lot of templates you know that
you<00:04:16.079> can<00:04:16.229> print<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.709> cut<00:04:17.039> with<00:04:17.519> your<00:04:17.549> craft

knife<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.630> takes<00:04:18.989> forever<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.769> if<00:04:20.280> you

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
knife and that takes forever but if you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.240 
knife and that takes forever but if you
use<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:20.909> dye<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.690> goes<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.289> fast<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.919> it's<00:04:23.070> so

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
use this dye it goes so fast and it's so

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.610 
use this dye it goes so fast and it's so
much<00:04:23.430> easier<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.659> slightly<00:04:25.409> smaller

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
much easier so this is slightly smaller

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.750 
much easier so this is slightly smaller
than<00:04:26.099> six<00:04:26.460> inches<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:26.849> your<00:04:27.240> even<00:04:27.570> your

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
than six inches so your even your

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.760 
than six inches so your even your
6x6<00:04:28.300> paper<00:04:28.450> pads<00:04:28.810> will<00:04:28.990> fit<00:04:29.170> right<00:04:29.200> on<00:04:29.440> top<00:04:29.620> of
