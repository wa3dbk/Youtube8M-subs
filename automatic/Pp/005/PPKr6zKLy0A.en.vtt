00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.709
 So 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.039
 conductor 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.039
 android software 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.089
 if we don't find we go 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.089
 of course you could cut looking 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.989
 because tons 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.509
 I do not care to give 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.159
 quotas 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.159
 wow ancelotti cas 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.410
 to establish 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.210
 trading expert anything thomas 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.019
 shell 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.109
 which will allow here but not then just 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.940
 no help interface 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 open 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.460
 current version continue 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.570
 but here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.560
 the interface has already changed because 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 this is another shell 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.770
 so right window pkm 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 to both 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.370
 whole year 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
 oh wood nice fight but this fight 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.290
 so we will have us 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.940
 so now we will configure 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.370
 new application or and install them on 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.940
 Desktop 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.900
 so apparently 5 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 in conductors 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.630
 By the way, what is such 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.720
 now kishe 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210
 don't know what we 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.650
 tom something much frequency 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.320
 ready there 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.940
 so region 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.320
 unsurpassed not see trades with us 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 what is connected with this year's watch 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.759
 totally sees here 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 to establish 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.989
 in Ukraine it is so 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.139
 so who is not installed 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.159
 ready 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.829
 so i can detect 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.959
 what is this app worth 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.709
 in the following way 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.329
 to give 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.329
 the screen will not appear like this 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.089
 say add whose account 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.089

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.180
 so but here he Moskal figured in 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 adjacent place is the city of Novosibirsk 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.559
 click save 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.109
 so here are tons 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.449
 Immediately loaded the weather forecast and here 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.619
 we made the clock so well 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.979
 earned wrong because 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.389
 what impurities are 16 5 here 17 46 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.179
 we go in setting 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.109
 settings we find time 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.539
 date and time 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.899
 so mood 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.729
 select time zone so set 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.099
 what should be put 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.649
 6 this is Novosibirsk he 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:41.569
 Yekaterinburg 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.169
 knives 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.159
 so adjust the time 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.159
 anyway 16 6 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.419
 to establish 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.419
 so 24 hour format all right 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.749
 the command is correct 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.469
 press the back button 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.469
 and did not come 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.849
 new shell which 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.849
 his x finished 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.089
 in the next 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.309
 budget 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.769
 power management to someone 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.769
 useful widget 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.680
 look 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.419
 we will have the same singer turned on 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.449
 great shut off immediately 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
 because we have nothing 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.759
 so let's see what with 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.759
 this is adjusted by screen brightness 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.849
 this is our background sync too 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.039
 useful perpetual nutrition lives give birth 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.469
 do not turn off 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.219
