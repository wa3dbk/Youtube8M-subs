00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 Yes hi shadow 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:09.170
 I wanted you to explain a bit about that safe driving though 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.980
 It is a little difficult theme 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.750
 It seems that the influence 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:20.270
 It is commentary of safe driving that anyone can do 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:26.830
 I think that I would like to do for the moment 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:31.360
 What time being from should I explained Te handle is always 10 minutes when Tokoro It is both hands handle 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:37.360
 I can always avoid right and left 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.140
 The seat seems to be the rest after having you keep in mind steering wheel operation 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.880
 Right 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:47.110
 Brake 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.730
 Please set the brake to sheet 1 of 1 that can be pressed all good 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 Then that one 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 After in I think that for the time being made somehow Well 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.290
 Hmm 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.200
 me 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.400
 stereo 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.490
 That's right stereo level is the first one 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.020
 Sound is eyes and sound, too Eye tote 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:16.750
 Eyes and ears 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:19.400
 I would like you to drive with eyes and ears. 7 is a stereo sound level is a little at zero 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.690
 Get open the window 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.690
 Now you're ready 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.610
 So I'll try to go a little fine day 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.380
 Because there are many pedestrians this way 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.960
 Left and right 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.960
 Please drive in the feeling that the pedestrian bicycle will jump out from 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.979
 Contact the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.240
 It's almost all right to listen to such a way 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.540
 In the feeling that it will stop if there is anything 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 This is after you drive 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:12.750
 It's an injection Yan car too, but it is not now 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 Toka be Well people from the car of the shadow of a parking violation flies out with 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.319
 Because there are many 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.319
 If parked while parked for 2 minutes while parked, it would be a form like larva eyes 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.400
 Is also when entering an intersection 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.480
 In the feeling that the bicycle will jump out 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.480
 It is slowing down 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 Something like this 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.510
 I'll try to go fine inch pathway little 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:58.500
 The next point is when you turn right, but it's back right 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:00.000
 There are cases where bicycle pedestrians come from, so be careful not just to the front right but to the right 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.530
 It is the back 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.310
 It is also like you to note 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.980
 Pause if possible 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.960
 It is nettsuka 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.240
 If you let me 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:19.130
 I think that I can turn to the safest right I can not turn the right turn when I turn 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.910
 That's right 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.910
 I will bite 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.110
 There are a lot of horses of parking and stopping 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.280
 I often come Tatte pops out people 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.270
 So the roads with many 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.040
 If Moraere out in most crawl like a feeling 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.040
 We can cope with jumping out 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.240
 After all 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.240
 ni 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:00.230
 It will be left and right but it will pop out with attention to the left and right 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.230
 I'm what If you think I He will stop 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.140
 It will not come 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.490
 It may come out and it may not stop . 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.490
 It may be driving 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.069
 Is not 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.150
 There is no 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.010
 It is a file 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:35.490
 Next turn left at the traffic light ahead 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:38.630
 It's entangled in the left, so be careful and turn left 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.630
 It will be in the form of saying 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.270
 Go straight ahead 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:13.909
 Oh, so-called turn right again 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.909
 It is the case of right turn only in right false alarm 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.849
 Well anymore snow 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:47.830
 Why is it easy but it takes seconds 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:50.889
 I would like Ne finish from last to that Well and for the time being turn right 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:57.069
 Right now it's right turn right back 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:57.990
 It is a warning in front of the right, but it gives birth to coming in from the rear right and echo car bicycle 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.460
 Is it 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.110
 You need 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.220
 If you can get 4 verses, you're right Slow 5 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.760
 The most important thing is 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.400
 Yes you already have both hands handle day 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.360
 Mimi Mimi Even That 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:19.940
 Take care and apply the brakes that you can stay at once 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:26.440
 It is a seating position, and after that, it is legal speed speed of the speed 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:30.180
 Well because it is immediately can stay such a speed setting I aim towards there 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.850
 I think you can drive 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.850
 So are you a simple I would like to, but is
