00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
good I set up for the trick and went

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.809 
good I set up for the trick and went
down<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.680> inrun<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.160> about<00:02:49.370> halfway<00:02:49.579> down

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
down the inrun and about halfway down

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.460 
down the inrun and about halfway down
the<00:02:50.000> inrun<00:02:50.299> realized<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.049> was<00:02:51.170> going<00:02:51.319> a

the inrun realized that I was going a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.080 
the inrun realized that I was going a
bit<00:02:51.560> faster<00:02:52.069> than<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.310> expected
