00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.660
 what is ice massage 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.469
 it's just taking the ice to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.110
 rub it on the body you will see that the 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.180
 definition is quite simple in one of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.669
 our illustrations we can observe 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.550
 how are you dealing with ice a 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:25.050
 back first of all it gets to the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.239
 Person in an appropriate position 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.430
 usually with a pillow to level 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.980
 the back doing that in the belly not 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.559
 there are bigger bones in that area and it tends 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.649
 to get depressed so we help you with 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.989
 a pillow to lift it and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.570
 hold it and the body is leveled then 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.820
 we take a glass of ice made of wheat 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.129
 Paul so he can get rid of it with 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.790
 ease you can peel it enough 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.390
 easy 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.390
 remove 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.910
 thing that the glass 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.730
 that stays like half of a 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.110
 just under half the glass for 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.880
 expose the ice so they can 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.370
 hold the ice without freezing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.230
 fingers and then they start rubbing it 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.970
 now when you start the 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.980
 treatment the skin is logically going to 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.630
 cooling can come to contribute for a 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.910
 minute and in some cases inclusive 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.610
 less some skins are very sensitive 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.670
 for which you will rub and then 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.470
 they will take a million towel which is 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.760
 very easy to make it if you do not 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.190
 get done 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.650
 and put in your hand and so you can 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.360
 drying the area can ever be used 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.010
 the same mitten to hold the ice 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.340
 then dry the area and start 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.530
 rub again while rubbing the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.840
 ice we also go through various 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.600
 stages usually the patient supports 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.000
 the first 3 minutes after which 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.950
 begins to feel that you burn this 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.380
 second stage lasts about 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.380
 5 minutes and after which it starts to 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.180
 feel insensitivity like the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.080
 Patient does not feel can rub the ice 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.380
 perhaps 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.290
 without drying it doing a review we have 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.600
 three minutes of cold feeling 45 of 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.360
 burning sensation and 4 minutes of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.370
 insensitivity this amounts approximately 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.790
 2 minutes after which the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.620
 treatment starts to really be 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.410
 beneficial but the vast majority of 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.300
 people shorten it too much and so 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.000
 they get the benefits they get afterwards 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.340
 of 12 minutes if you rub from 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.360
 12 to 15 minutes those last 3 minutes 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.300
 those minutes are precious minutes 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.940
 body or the area becomes so cold that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.400
 the internal capillaries of the blood are 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.080
 dilate and open which means that the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.940
 area receives renewed blood to make 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.820
 facing the problem and it's for that reason 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.010
 when this treatment is given the 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.520
 area where you are rubbing the ice 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.170
 it reddens greatly 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.270
 if the cold contracts the blood vessels 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.069
 your patient will not feel the effect of 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.989
 that redness and redness 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.810
 means that you are attracting more 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.250
 blood to the area therefore the secret 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 of this treatment is to procure 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.190
 prolong as much as possible 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.110
 treatment and rub slowly keep 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.760
 the area dry and rub vigorously to 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.600
 that numbs or freezes us and so 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.600
 you will get good results 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 let's show next how functions 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.340
 of treatment 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.709
 usually this treatment is applied 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.690
 in the shoulder in case of bursitis this is 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.240
 a common problem around the whole 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.700
 world 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.580
 and three sacks or bags in the area of 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.220
 shoulder and maybe one or all three are 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.980
 inflamed and as a result the patient 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.490
 have bursitis or inflammation of these 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.770
 muscle spaces in the same way in the 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.380
 elbow each of these joints have 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.420
 inter-muscular or intercostal bags 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.180
 and these bags are full of liquids and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.270
 inflamed and result in acute pain the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.190
 elbow very often all 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.990
 we have a position an angle 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.800
 maximum extension that if we pass it 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.650
 we injured the elbow the tendons the 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.350
 ligaments and we can injure many 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.150
 sometimes the small fibers which 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.350
 results in inflammation and deep pain 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.660
 so we use the ice in this 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.889
 treatment to achieve a cure 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.409
 problem 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.139
 for all those who have the 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.240
 tennis elbow problem use this 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.580
 treatment with ice and then tie 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.229
 or sell the elbow so that it does not 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.060
 extend or pass beyond a 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.159
 recommended extension at least 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.520
 until the healing process has 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.949
 taken its place by that method the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.919
 patient can quickly recover his 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.749
 health the treatment consists of no less 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.449
 15 minutes of application do not try to 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.919
 shorten it remember that time is very 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.050
 essential to obtain good results 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.729
 there is another word that I would like 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.620
 you remember they do when they massage 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:11.870
 of ice think of this word pray r &amp; h 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:15.099
 resignifica rest h means ice 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.070
 it means: compress or bandage 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:21.350
 wrapping the area 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.120
 means elevation when you are 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.140
 giving an ice massage remember the 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.240
 word rece apply the treatment of 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.300
 ice and if the patient has suffered injury 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.210
 in the elbow try not to move it 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.849
 and the ice treatment maybe what 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.580
 have to repeat several times in the day 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.060
 maybe every two hours can give you a 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.789
 ice massage then with what you read a 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.190
 bandage wrapping the area usually 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.440
 there are inflammations swelling is eczema and 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.960
 this is going to help remarkably and then 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.319
 raise that elbow with pillows or some 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.210
 thing so that it is as high as possible 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.849
 they can apply the same for the ankle 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.780
 or the knee the same principle always 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.159
 is used in this ice massage a 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.740
 very simple treatment in your 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.389
 application and very effective always have 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.909
 in your home ice within your reach 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.710
 refrigerator so that you have what 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.270
 necessary to use in any 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.620
 moment so that we achieve 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.620
 wonderful results
