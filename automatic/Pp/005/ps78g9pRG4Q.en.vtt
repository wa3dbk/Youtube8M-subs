with<00:01:22.650> these<00:01:22.770> little<00:01:23.009> cards<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.759> don't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
with these little cards if you don't

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020 
with these little cards if you don't
know<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.500> apply<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.850> of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
know how to apply this which kind of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
know how to apply this which kind of
common<00:01:27.390> sense<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.900> sometimes<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.860> it's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
common sense but sometimes like if it's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
common sense but sometimes like if it's
your<00:01:29.130> first<00:01:29.159> time<00:01:29.460> wearing<00:01:29.790> makeup<00:01:29.970> this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
your first time wearing makeup this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
your first time wearing makeup this
would<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.750> great<00:01:30.990> thing<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> buy

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
would be a really great thing to buy

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920 
would be a really great thing to buy
because<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.150> natural<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
because it's just so natural and it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.630 
because it's just so natural and it
wouldn't<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.350> BAM<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.009> started<00:01:35.520> wearing

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
wouldn't be like BAM I started wearing

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
wouldn't be like BAM I started wearing
makeup<00:01:35.729> especially<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:36.869> in

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
makeup especially like if you're in

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740 
makeup especially like if you're in
eighth<00:01:37.079> grade<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.650> um<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:39.150> they

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
eighth grade or something um but they

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
eighth grade or something um but they
have<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> classic<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.920> fashion<00:01:41.130> look

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
have like a classic like a fashion look

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.670 
have like a classic like a fashion look
and<00:01:41.759> add<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.240> look<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.229> follow

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and add a look I don't really follow

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.420 
and add a look I don't really follow
these<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.720> helpful<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.979> think

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
these but they are helpful and I think

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.719 
these but they are helpful and I think
they<00:01:47.579> make<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> lot<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.060> sense<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:49.070> yeah<00:01:50.070> that's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
they make a lot of sense so yeah that's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.910 
they make a lot of sense so yeah that's
really<00:01:51.030> cool<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.869> also<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.409> affordable

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
really cool it's also really affordable

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.340 
really cool it's also really affordable
i<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:53.640> paid<00:01:53.820> somewhere<00:01:54.240> around<00:01:54.390> 34<00:01:55.229> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
i think i paid somewhere around 34 this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
i think i paid somewhere around 34 this
at<00:01:55.560> sephora<00:01:55.979> i<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.700> quite<00:01:56.939> remember<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
at sephora i don't quite remember that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.670 
at sephora i don't quite remember that
so<00:01:57.750> bad<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:57.960> should<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.290> thought<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so bad i should have thought about that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.459 
so bad i should have thought about that
but<00:01:59.549> yeah<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.450> pretty<00:02:00.630> affordable<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.320> non

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but yeah it's pretty affordable for non

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.139 
but yeah it's pretty affordable for non
color<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> divide<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.700> it's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
color so if you divide that up it's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
color so if you divide that up it's
pretty<00:02:03.450> good<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.229> also<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.799> easy

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
pretty good it's also really easy

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.270 
pretty good it's also really easy
because<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
because it

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.520 
because it
one<00:02:06.460> pallet<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.240> it's<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.840> got<00:02:07.990> everything

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
you needed including the eyeliner so you

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.360 
you needed including the eyeliner so you
could<00:02:11.470> take<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.740> with<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.100> on<00:02:12.220> vacation
