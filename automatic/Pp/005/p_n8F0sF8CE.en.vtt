 Bryansk Engineering Plant 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.969
 one of the largest enterprises 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.670
 transport engineering of Russia for 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.500
 almost one and a half century history 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 the enterprise produced steam locomotives 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 Diesel freight cars of various types and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.320
 modifications trunk and shunting 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.109
 bnc locomotives and other products today 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.120
 it is a modern dynamic 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.430
 enterprise which is successful 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.460
 implemented advanced management techniques 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.800
 and organizing production from the beginning 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.989
 two thousandth strategic direction 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.110
 for the company becomes the production 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.410
 mainline diesel locomotives 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.460
 in 2014 in record time for just 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.559
 70 days 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.629
 Designed and manufactured simple in 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.610
 management and operation of freight 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 mainline diesel locomotive with collector 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.829
 drive 2 t25 km. 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.629
 This project is the result of well-coordinated work. 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.939
 the whole team of the enterprise 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 it was created with the participation of specialists 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.630
 Transmashholding and Russian iron 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.850
 roads within the program 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.780
 import substitution and consists practically 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 completely from Russian components 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.360
 the project begins with an idea with engineering 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 thoughts 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.409
 development and design is carried out with 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600
 using modern software 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 products as required 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 project management 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.450
 established feedback to the production 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.640
 and operating services to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.770
 operational problem solving 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.220
 and implementing improvement proposals 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 designs and technologies for 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.670
 locomotive production 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.040
 over 30 thousand parts are used 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 most of which are produced on 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.250
 enterprise factory is equipped with modern 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.390
 high-tech equipment 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.650
 machining centers complexes 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.940
 laser cutting 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.310
 machine tools with numerical software 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.830
 management to ensure 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 uninterrupted equipment operation 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.260
 autonomous is actively implemented 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.260
 maintenance and scheduling 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.140
 production chain 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.570
 diesel locomotive 2 t25 to them represents 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.770
 line with a certain amount 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.320
 assembly and welding positions and 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.720
 assigned to them the scope of work and 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.850
 operators today 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.920
 ensured the rhythmic work of the line in 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.620
 time so then every two days with 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.400
 the last position of the thread goes out ready 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.590
 diesel locomotive significant difference new 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.870
 diesel locomotive from its predecessors it 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.850
 traction driver cab 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.090
 meets all modern requirements

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.650
 equipped with air conditioning 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 of air 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.360
 used in the decoration of new vibro 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.850
 first damping materials 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.190
 applied passive safety system 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.590
 which protects the locomotive brigade in 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.150
 emergency situations 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.769
 the next steps in building a locomotive 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.739
 are coloring 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.400
 installation of pipe systems, electrical

 verification of all systems 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.489
 assemblies and units in addition to service quality 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.130
 enterprises are carried out by representatives 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.350
 Russian railways after that 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.610
 the locomotive is ready to go to its place 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.300
 operation resulting from 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.280
 in 2015 restructuring 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.459
 production capacity of the enterprise 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.650
 will be 300 sections of the locomotive 2 tons 25 meters 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.620
 year 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.100
 diesel locomotive 2 t25 to m is basic 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.239

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.969
 providing quality products and 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.090
 lower cost by reducing 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.200
 operating costs and this is very important in 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.389
 present conditions 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.530
 since the issues of acquiring a new 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.760
 traction train 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.969
 oao rzh are considered in terms of 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.739
 optimal price-performance ratio in 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.739
 good way to a bright future
