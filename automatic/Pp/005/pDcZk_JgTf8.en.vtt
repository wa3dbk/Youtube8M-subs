00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
fantastic features on its let's take a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.929 
fantastic features on its let's take a
closer<00:00:14.760> look<00:00:16.369> ok<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> seat<00:00:17.760> then

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
closer look ok so the seat then

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.910 
closer look ok so the seat then
fantastic<00:00:18.900> value<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.260> money<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.590> really

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
fantastic value for money this really

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
fantastic value for money this really
and<00:00:20.100> they've<00:00:20.610> really<00:00:20.820> focused<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.720> two

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and they've really focused on the two

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.240 
and they've really focused on the two
main<00:00:22.050> priorities<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.770> obviously<00:00:23.039> when<00:00:23.160> you're

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
main priorities of obviously when you're

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.189 
main priorities of obviously when you're
getting<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.520> wetsuit<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> fit<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
getting a wetsuit and that's the fit and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.800 
getting a wetsuit and that's the fit and
obviously<00:00:25.440> the<00:00:25.560> thermal<00:00:25.860> properties<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
obviously the thermal properties and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.269 
obviously the thermal properties and
neoprene<00:00:27.810> itself<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.590> made<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:28.860> a<00:00:28.949> super

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
neoprene itself is made from a super

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.740 
neoprene itself is made from a super
stretch<00:00:29.550> material<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.600> really

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
stretch material so it's really

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.939 
stretch material so it's really
comfortable<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:31.289> you've<00:00:31.380> got<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.680> makes

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
comfortable when you've got it on makes

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.340 
comfortable when you've got it on makes
it<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.250> easy<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.520> put<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.879> as<00:00:33.059> well<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it really easy to put on as well and it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.779 
it really easy to put on as well and it
also<00:00:34.469> has<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> thermal<00:00:35.070> core<00:00:35.250> property<00:00:35.640> built

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
also has a thermal core property built

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.180 
also has a thermal core property built
in<00:00:35.999> as<00:00:36.089> well<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> keeps<00:00:36.659> you<00:00:36.809> warm<00:00:37.190> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
in as well so it keeps you warm the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.829 
in as well so it keeps you warm the
seals<00:00:38.429> on<00:00:38.609> the<00:00:38.699> wetsuit<00:00:39.120> they're<00:00:39.629> blind

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
seals on the wetsuit they're blind

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.259 
seals on the wetsuit they're blind
stitched<00:00:40.289> all<00:00:41.249> around<00:00:41.639> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.089> have<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
stitched all around and then they have a

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.000 
stitched all around and then they have a
layer<00:00:42.479> of<00:00:42.659> neoprene<00:00:43.019> tape<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.499> the<00:00:43.589> underside

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
layer of neoprene tape on the underside

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.129 
layer of neoprene tape on the underside
as<00:00:44.190> well<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.940> again<00:00:45.179> stops<00:00:45.510> any<00:00:45.659> flushing

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:46.139 
as well which again stops any flushing

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:48.349 
as well which again stops any flushing
through<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> actual<00:00:46.679> seal<00:00:46.949> itself<00:00:47.359> also

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
through the actual seal itself also

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.549 
through the actual seal itself also
another<00:00:48.629> great<00:00:48.899> feature<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> don't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
another great feature that you don't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.349 
another great feature that you don't
tend<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.859> find<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.159> awful<00:00:50.429> lot<00:00:50.549> of<00:00:50.579> wetsuits<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
tend to find an awful lot of wetsuits is

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.149 
tend to find an awful lot of wetsuits is
they<00:00:51.539> minimize<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.109> amount<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> panels<00:00:52.829> as

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
they minimize the amount of panels as

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.559 
they minimize the amount of panels as
well<00:00:53.429> so<00:00:53.670> obviously<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.120> panels<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
well so obviously the more panels that

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.389 
well so obviously the more panels that
you<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.319> more<00:00:55.469> stitching<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.249> less

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you have the more stitching the less

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.860 
you have the more stitching the less
panels<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> less<00:00:57.059> stitching<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.629> obviously

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
panels the less stitching so obviously

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.180 
panels the less stitching so obviously
less<00:00:58.019> stitching<00:00:58.409> the<00:00:58.559> less<00:00:58.679> water<00:00:58.889> that<00:00:59.100> can

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
less stitching the less water that can

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
less stitching the less water that can
penetrate<00:00:59.839> so<00:01:00.839> take<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.019> look<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> neck

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
penetrate so take a look at the neck

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.759 
penetrate so take a look at the neck
they've<00:01:02.129> included<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.519> glide<00:01:02.760> skin<00:01:03.239> seal<00:01:03.929> again

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
they've included a glide skin seal again

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
they've included a glide skin seal again
this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.040> great<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.790> contact<00:01:06.450> between<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this is great for contact between you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.090 
this is great for contact between you
and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> wetsuit<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.560> again<00:01:07.710> stops<00:01:07.950> any

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and the wetsuit and again stops any

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
and the wetsuit and again stops any
water<00:01:08.340> flushing<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.660> see<00:01:09.810> along<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
water flushing as you can see along the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
water flushing as you can see along the
top<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.620> well<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> second

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
top here as well we have a second

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
top here as well we have a second
neoprene<00:01:12.710> neck<00:01:13.710> collar<00:01:14.010> we'll<00:01:14.250> take<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> look

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
neoprene neck collar we'll take a look

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.220 
neoprene neck collar we'll take a look
at<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.820> around<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> back<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
at that around the back there's a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.560 
at that around the back there's a
another<00:01:16.680> added<00:01:16.920> feature<00:01:17.420> they've<00:01:18.420> also

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
another added feature they've also

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.620 
another added feature they've also
included<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:19.320> polyurethane<00:01:20.510> patent<00:01:21.510> on<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
included these polyurethane patent on it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.090 
included these polyurethane patent on it
as<00:01:21.840> well<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.620> great<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:22.920> you've<00:01:23.010> got

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
as well this is great when you've got

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
as well this is great when you've got
your<00:01:23.220> BCD<00:01:23.550> on<00:01:23.850> there's<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.360> stops<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.690> from

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
your BCD on there's a stops it from

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
your BCD on there's a stops it from
moving<00:01:24.900> around<00:01:25.290> keeps<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:25.920> nice<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> firmly

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
moving around keeps it nice and firmly

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
moving around keeps it nice and firmly
in<00:01:26.730> place<00:01:27.230> you<00:01:28.230> move<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.560> towards<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.130> cuff

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
in place you move down towards the cuff

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.800 
in place you move down towards the cuff
I've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.770> really<00:01:31.770> against<00:01:32.010> simple

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
I've got some really against simple

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.750 
I've got some really against simple
panel<00:01:33.810> system<00:01:34.200> again<00:01:34.770> less<00:01:34.980> panels<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.640> less

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
panel system again less panels the less

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.880 
panel system again less panels the less
flushing<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.300> then<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:36.990> inside<00:01:37.380> we've

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
flushing and then on the inside we've
