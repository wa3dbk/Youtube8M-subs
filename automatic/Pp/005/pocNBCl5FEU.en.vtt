00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you can see probably charged by a micro

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
you can see probably charged by a micro
SP<00:01:07.049> since<00:01:07.350> there's<00:01:07.560> no<00:01:07.710> other<00:01:07.890> ports<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:09.299> the

pistol<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.030> we<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.140> read

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
pistol but we will see that when I read

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.679 
pistol but we will see that when I read
the<00:01:16.619> specs<00:01:16.890> again<00:01:17.220> such<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.210> switch<00:01:18.479> here

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the specs again such as a switch here

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
the specs again such as a switch here
quickly<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> camera<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.640> where

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
quickly to the camera right there where

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
quickly to the camera right there where
we<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> phone<00:01:21.570> camera<00:01:21.930> booting<00:01:22.320> up

we can see the phone camera booting up

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
we can see the phone camera booting up
right<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.070> no<00:01:23.220> status<00:01:23.490> LED<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
right now we have no status LED but it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
right now we have no status LED but it's
looking<00:01:24.960> quite<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.500> quality<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.189> speed

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
looking quite good in quality in speed

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.080

owl also can rotate the camera here and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.020 
owl also can rotate the camera here and
then<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> back<00:01:31.140> camera

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030
