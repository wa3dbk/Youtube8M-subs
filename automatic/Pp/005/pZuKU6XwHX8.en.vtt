the<00:00:47.039> camry<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.239> grill<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.170> looks<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> lot

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the camry is this grill it looks a lot

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
the camry is this grill it looks a lot
like<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> avalon<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> corolla<00:00:51.510> grill<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
like the avalon and corolla grill so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.139 
like the avalon and corolla grill so
it's<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.890> starting<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> come<00:00:53.430> together<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's all starting to come together as a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.080 
it's all starting to come together as a
family<00:00:54.480> resemblance<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.320> fact<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.090> 2015

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
family resemblance in fact the 2015

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
family resemblance in fact the 2015
yards<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.660> also<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> similar<00:00:58.559> grill

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
yards will also have a similar grill

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.380 
yards will also have a similar grill
they're<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.579> two<00:00:59.730> different<00:00:59.760> types<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
they're actually two different types of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.599 
they're actually two different types of
grill<00:01:00.629> there's<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.350> five<00:01:01.649> bar<00:01:01.920> grill<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> a

honeycomb grill for the sporty or models

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
honeycomb grill for the sporty or models
what<00:01:05.939> hasn't<00:01:06.180> changed<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> 2015<00:01:07.799> Camry

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
what hasn't changed for the 2015 Camry

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
what hasn't changed for the 2015 Camry
is<00:01:08.400> what's<00:01:08.909> under<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> hood<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.229> still<00:01:10.470> have

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is what's under the hood you still have

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
is what's under the hood you still have
the<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.220> engine<00:01:11.610> options<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.600> high

the same two engine options the high

horsepower<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> 3.5

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939

percent<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> sales<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.020> surprised<00:01:28.409> if

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
percent of sales don't be surprised if

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
percent of sales don't be surprised if
