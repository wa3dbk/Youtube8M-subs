commie<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.439> ancient<00:01:05.369> hope<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.970> what

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
commie of ancient hope I think is what

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.789 
commie of ancient hope I think is what
this<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.540> prevent<00:01:06.689> I'll<00:01:06.930> combat<00:01:07.290> damage<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this to prevent I'll combat damage is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
this to prevent I'll combat damage is
done<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> turn<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
done in a turn and they can just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
done in a turn and they can just
continue<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.070> basically

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
continue to get it back so you basically

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
continue to get it back so you basically
have<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.210> sideboard<00:01:12.689> cardiac<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> have

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have to have a sideboard cardiac to have

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
have to have a sideboard cardiac to have
rest<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.799> peace<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.909> compete<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.330> their<00:01:15.570> deck

down<00:01:40.229> literally<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> match<00:01:41.520> does<00:01:41.850> come<00:01:42.060> down

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
down literally the match does come down

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.740 
down literally the match does come down
to<00:01:42.210> clock<00:01:42.450> management<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.250> unfortunately<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
to clock management and unfortunately I

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.550 
to clock management and unfortunately I
had<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.259> worst<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> clock<00:01:47.369> management<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
had the worst of the clock management so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
had the worst of the clock management so
also<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.009> screwed<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> video<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> was

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
also it screwed up the video when I was

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.630 
also it screwed up the video when I was
trying<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> click<00:01:51.869> random<00:01:52.110> f<00:01:52.470> keys<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.340> stack

the stacking triggers what's more

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.160 
the stacking triggers what's more
heartbreaking<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.819> they<00:02:21.030> cut<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.390> 32<00:02:21.840> for

how<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.819> math<00:03:12.060> works<00:03:12.299> but<00:03:12.829> anyway<00:03:13.829> if<00:03:14.450> that's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
how the math works but anyway if that's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.939 
how the math works but anyway if that's
a<00:03:15.720> bodacious<00:03:16.200> you're<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.769> 4-3<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.060> a

a bodacious you're not on a 4-3 so a

little bit bummed out right now I

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.379 
little bit bummed out right now I
thought<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.389> deck<00:03:22.459> did<00:03:23.459> play<00:03:23.669> phenomenally

that he was a grixis delver deck so he

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150

a
two<00:06:41.849> planes<00:06:42.150> basically<00:06:42.960> because<00:06:43.259> the<00:06:43.409> one

planes for the flagstone dying and the

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.969 
planes for the flagstone dying and the
ghost<00:06:45.509> quarter<00:06:45.840> from<00:06:46.080> killing<00:06:46.500> a<00:06:46.560> land<00:06:46.770> and

that one comes into play untapped and

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.809 
that one comes into play untapped and
then<00:06:49.289> you<00:06:49.379> can<00:06:49.530> tap<00:06:49.710> for<00:06:49.919> a<00:06:49.949> white<00:06:50.520> so<00:06:50.789> that

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
then you can tap for a white so that

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.730 
then you can tap for a white so that
that<00:06:51.389> is<00:06:51.569> that<00:06:51.719> little<00:06:51.870> implication<00:06:52.439> in<00:06:52.560> here

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
that is that little implication in here

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.309
