00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.099
 now next video lesson that I'm going to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 explain to you here is about what is and is 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.570
 the controllers the virtual dj ok a lot 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.700
 good 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.460
 first you have to have a 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.630
 file called map 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.779
 here is an example of a map of a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 file goes if the other mapper by 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.330
 example of my parent company it comes from 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.330
 next way 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:55.200
 O summer it comes a called part of vai 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.780
 if a part called map 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.580
 only with these two files you 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.560
 can have a configuration of 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.760
 your parent company 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.860
 I'll explain further where 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.620
 you find them 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 First I'm going to teach now how to teach 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.729
 look for the first 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.530
 for you to have your files later 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.390
 explain where you are going to place the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.390
 have operation 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:29.420
 you will come here huh 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:33.240
 if you have the page of your device 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.800
 you look in the box or in the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 do something like that 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.640
 his name the official website for example 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.640
 My case is Hercules. 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.760
 Ok , I'll go there and your official website or 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.580
 Click on the official website 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:01.420
 I'll look for maps in case you 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.420
 Can I come support ok? 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:11.030
 and you're looking for what's not to do with you 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.280
 your site you can do the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:20.239
 next goes on google and puts the name 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.310
 your map controller but in front 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.310
 mapfre and click 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.299
 Here you see this official page and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.340
 here they are 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.459
 the equipment will choose here in case 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.459
 the sound with controls 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.480
 I look for my model is very 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.480
 important to know your model is 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.970
 or control 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.470
 But I look for media matters here. 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.430
 the video maps for you to lower 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.240
 quietly 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.990
 ok its very simple and very easy 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.840
 to work 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:26.250
 if you can not find forums and 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:27.750
 generally google will guide you if 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.260
 can put the gender virtual to the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.260
 front 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.000
 so you will find support that 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.240
 do you want 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.030
 until you find it raised and if these two 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.060
 so important matches which is good 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.010
 now let's go there to demonstrate how it is 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.770
 that makes 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:59.540
 now you will download the file you will 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:06.630
 of compact he picks up here documents 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:09.440
 virtual dj is going to see in maps work 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.440
 part of the map 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:28.689
 now the most part and play that there for 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:31.330
 replace there you go back from will 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.279
 go from varzim game file here 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:39.090
 to replace or copy 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:42.090
 Okay, so the controller is 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.090
 configured
