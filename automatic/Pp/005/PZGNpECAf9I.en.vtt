all<00:00:00.299> right<00:00:00.450> let's<00:00:00.659> start<00:00:00.719> off<00:00:01.020> with<00:00:01.050> we

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
all right let's start off with we

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.649 
all right let's start off with we
started<00:00:01.770> out<00:00:01.890> with<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.100> basic<00:00:02.550> power<00:00:03.030> longboard

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
started out with a basic power longboard

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.550 
started out with a basic power longboard
so<00:00:04.080> 800<00:00:04.830> watts<00:00:05.040> 36<00:00:05.940> volts<00:00:06.299> John<00:00:07.200> speed<00:00:07.440> at

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
so 800 watts 36 volts John speed at

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.120 
so 800 watts 36 volts John speed at
32,000<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.510> said<00:00:10.130> traditionally

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
32,000 so we said traditionally

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.129 
32,000 so we said traditionally
controlled<00:00:11.580> by<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> hand<00:00:12.150> controller<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.900> we

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
controlled by a hand controller and we

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.650 
controlled by a hand controller and we
get<00:00:13.290> rid<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:14.429> basically<00:00:14.639> took<00:00:14.910> got<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
get rid of that we basically took got a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.890 
get rid of that we basically took got a

let's just pull this away from that lets

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
let's just pull this away from that lets
us<00:00:51.030> run<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.539> you've<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> midgets<00:00:53.129> handle

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
us run there you've got a midgets handle

control on how fast we go gives us a
throttle<00:01:09.960> control<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.860> got<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> small<00:01:11.310> USB<00:01:11.520> hop

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
from the gang to know where the gestures

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490 
from the gang to know where the gestures
are<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> recognition<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the

are we do the recognition of the

driver<00:01:33.490> waiting<00:01:33.970> for<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.780> tells<00:01:34.960> us<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.290> what

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
driver waiting for it tells us that what

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.530 
driver waiting for it tells us that what
is<00:01:35.620> recognizable<00:01:36.310> we<00:01:36.430> validate<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.030> goes

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
is recognizable we validate it goes

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.760 
is recognizable we validate it goes
through<00:01:37.750> there<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.320> then<00:01:38.470> we<00:01:38.530> use<00:01:38.650> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
through there and then we use the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.160 
through there and then we use the
fidgets<00:01:39.100> interface<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.729> adjust<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.330> throttle

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
fidgets interface to adjust the throttle

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.760 
fidgets interface to adjust the throttle
it<00:01:41.950> also<00:01:42.280> we<00:01:42.550> use<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.940> tablet<00:01:43.930> too<00:01:44.290> if<00:01:44.560> we

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
it also we use the tablet too if we

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.620 
it also we use the tablet too if we
bring<00:01:45.130> those<00:01:45.310> modes<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:46.180> pull<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
do accelerometer tracking we do we could

do accelerometer tracking we do we could
actually<00:01:54.280> did<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.670> video<00:01:54.820> streaming<00:01:55.300> capsule

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
actually did the video streaming capsule

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.340 
actually did the video streaming capsule
at<00:01:55.810> all<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:57.220> it's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.090> took<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> little<00:01:59.170> bit<00:01:59.290> of

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
at all so it's a took a little bit of

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.230 
at all so it's a took a little bit of
time<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.650> put<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.890> all<00:01:59.979> together<00:02:00.159> but<00:02:00.520> all<00:02:00.759> in

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
time to put it all together but all in

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.480 
time to put it all together but all in
all<00:02:01.330> it's<00:02:01.630> fairly<00:02:02.619> straightforward<00:02:02.770> hardware

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
all it's fairly straightforward hardware

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.150 
all it's fairly straightforward hardware
field<00:02:03.670> okay<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:04.390> what<00:02:04.600> does<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.899> GoPro<00:02:05.560> do<00:02:05.770> and

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
field okay so what does the GoPro do and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.620 
field okay so what does the GoPro do and
the<00:02:06.430> kinect<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.789> mean<00:02:06.910> is<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.149> is<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.450> just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
the kinect I mean is it is that just

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.270 
the kinect I mean is it is that just
reporting<00:02:07.990> video<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.440> gopros<00:02:08.800> are<00:02:08.979> just<00:02:09.160> so

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
reporting video the gopros are just so

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.680 
reporting video the gopros are just so
we<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.520> do<00:02:09.700> our<00:02:09.729> videos<00:02:10.149> we<00:02:10.450> can<00:02:10.570> actually

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
we can do our videos we can actually

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.910 
we can do our videos we can actually
show<00:02:10.929> people<00:02:11.260> what<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.470> looks<00:02:11.620> like<00:02:11.739> I'm

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
show people what it looks like I'm

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.250 
show people what it looks like I'm
