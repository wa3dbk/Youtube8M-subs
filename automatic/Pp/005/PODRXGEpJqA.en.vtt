00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.290
 I have come to tell you something you already know 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.290
 but that you have forgotten 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.450
 remember those days when you started 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.450
 to play 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.429
 you were level 1 and like aunts a lot 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.059
 mistakes that now seem to you boyfriends 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.800
 but I tried to improve by getting 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.340
 to that coveted level 30 play-by-play 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.670
 split game all because I loved this 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.670
 game 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.060
 but once you got that level something 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.060
 changed in fret in the dark world of 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.360
 the pews with their effective trolls and people 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.360
 toxic 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 all your world fell the darkness and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.430
 you were absorbed because they aspire 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430
 self destruction 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.420
 in this game there are two types of people 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.610
 those that have been devoured by 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.680
 this community that are never to blame 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.830
 and always look for excuses why not 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.600
 they get to diamond and those that know 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.710
 admit their mistakes and try to 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 solve the day to day 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.429
 being the first is the easy way 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.259
 you will live in your bubble waving to everything 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.619
 the world with your friends and complaining about 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.619
 do not go up 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.800
 The real challenge is to affect your mistakes and 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.600
 try to solve them then those that 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 they are not able to see even their own 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.690
 weakness will never be able to find those of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.690
 your adversaries 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.180
 really that we are afraid not 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.280
 we are afraid in our darkness of 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.380
 fall into the abyss and be consumed by 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.840
 the buttonhole 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.930
 we are afraid of our own strength to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.060
 our own potential fear that if 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.460
 we show our true nature 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.020
 we are unstoppable and the people of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.030
 around us they feel bad about 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.509
 same for continuing in that world of 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.509
 darkness 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.819
 all these feelings blame anger rage 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.099
 are the anchor that we have hung to 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.319
 our neck and use astra more and more 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.209
 and more towards the darkness 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.739
 perhaps you think that any of them 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.739
 he surrendered or blamed others 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.569
 and now get up and look in the mirror 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.390
 observing who you are and who would want 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.450
 be when you are clear about your goal 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.830
 you will know what your limits are and you will have 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.830
 the ability to break it 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.390
 everything you crave is within reach of 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.980
 your hand all you need is to have 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.310
 the value to lengthen the arm and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.330
 grab it but nobody absolutely nobody 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.330
 he will pick it up for you 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.230
 It's your decision I took the time 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.230
 mine
