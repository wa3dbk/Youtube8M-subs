lot more life than just typical everyday
material<00:02:04.479> existence<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.290> kind<00:02:05.440> of<00:02:05.470> like

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
material existence it's kind of like

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.950 
material existence it's kind of like
thinking<00:02:05.920> outside<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.280> box<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:07.360> gotta<00:02:07.540> hold<00:02:07.810> a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
thinking outside the box we gotta hold a

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.790 
thinking outside the box we gotta hold a
space<00:02:08.759> physics<00:02:09.759> frequencies<00:02:10.739> radio<00:02:11.739> waves

and<00:02:12.489> that's<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.760> one<00:02:13.030> aspect<00:02:13.180> that's<00:02:13.510> a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and that's just one aspect that's a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.840 
and that's just one aspect that's a
third<00:02:13.930> dent<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.410> life<00:02:14.680> being<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.640> real

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
third dent to the life being it's real

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.690 
third dent to the life being it's real
fast<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:17.140> then<00:02:17.200> there's<00:02:17.709> other<00:02:17.980> life<00:02:18.280> forms

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
fast and then there's other life forms

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.910 
fast and then there's other life forms
and<00:02:18.850> other<00:02:18.910> thresholds<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.600> life<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.590> exists

faster are not as easily noticeable I

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.880 
faster are not as easily noticeable I
was<00:02:28.120> introduced<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:29.140> method<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.830> a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
was introduced to a method and a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.030 
was introduced to a method and a
protocol<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.810> enabled<00:02:31.810> me<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.050> train<00:02:32.830> my

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
protocol that enabled me to train my

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.190 
protocol that enabled me to train my
eyes<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.150> object<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:34.959> very

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
eyes to see the object of it is very

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
eyes to see the object of it is very
simple<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.650> very<00:02:35.739> basic<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.580> you're

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
simple and very basic just like you're

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.190 
simple and very basic just like you're
looking<00:02:36.820> at<00:02:37.090> me<00:02:37.209> right<00:02:37.239> now<00:02:37.420> there's<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.019> lot<00:02:38.050> of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
looking at me right now there's a lot of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.380 
looking at me right now there's a lot of
things<00:02:38.410> going<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.920> within<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.850> spectrum<00:02:40.269> of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
things going on within the spectrum of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.810 
things going on within the spectrum of
life<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.620> difficult<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.250> human<00:02:42.670> eyes<00:02:42.790> to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
life that is difficult for human eyes to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.110 
life that is difficult for human eyes to
see<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.959> sunlight<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.950> bright<00:02:45.220> blocking

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
see the sunlight is so bright blocking

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.600 
see the sunlight is so bright blocking
out<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.269> direct<00:02:46.750> light<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.170> side

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
out the direct light of the side

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.100 
out the direct light of the side
expanded<00:02:48.610> coronal<00:02:49.180> light<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.720> comes<00:02:49.870> from

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
expanded coronal light that comes from

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.539 
expanded coronal light that comes from
the<00:02:50.290> Sun<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.500> I'm<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.769> looking<00:02:51.070> directly<00:02:51.190> into

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
the Sun so I'm not looking directly into

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.890 
the Sun so I'm not looking directly into
the<00:02:51.790> Sun<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.269> always<00:02:52.450> tell<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.720> don't

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the Sun because I always tell you don't

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.050 
the Sun because I always tell you don't
look<00:02:53.019> at<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> Sun<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:54.250> looking<00:02:54.549> right<00:02:54.730> next

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
look at the Sun but looking right next

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.220 

now<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.579> could<00:03:09.760> use<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.060> camera<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.140> had

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
now you could use that camera if you had

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.840 
now you could use that camera if you had
a<00:03:11.260> tripod<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.769> be<00:03:11.860> better<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.700> could

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
a tripod to be better and you could
