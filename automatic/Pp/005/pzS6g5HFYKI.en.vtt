 just behind it on the name tag 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 and we'll choose here first 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.049
 suitable for the weko that the weko 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.240
 name tag and yes times markus as well 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.170
 Our truck driver in let's play is called 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.180
 Under the hill, such a nice one 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.439
 name tag exempt because sometimes a green 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.079
 and do nancy test and then have to 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.640
 we have to go order that's why 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.140
 order and then go in again 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.350
 and then only come in led 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.270
 make frames outside 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 To do this, we also go to accessories to choose that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 License plate is made of license plates 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.299
 good but name tag and then we go 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.799
 also to scrap then we can 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.810
 Here's just a simple one 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.210
 make frame out of drum or here then 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
 different frames with different 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.240
 either somebody selects the colors 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 apply white tent 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.710
 sometimes media did not want to take 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.380
 then you see that in the worldwide framework 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.620
 or here in the blue frame of the hear yellow 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:17.099
 green red cyan purple orange or pink 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.660
 we would take a green frame 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.640
 I say just apply that no matter what 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.180
 because there is and test is doing 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:29.550
 also next to it 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:32.190
 but once a honorable red frame so 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.230
 and thus put the whole and then 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.660
 Do you have it here now? 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 colored nameplates nameplates with 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.140
 one with the truck of the marketer and truck 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.030
 a led frame would then pull that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.400
 can you do something good then active now 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.720
 in the frame now not so extreme though 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.459
 whenever you turn the light on then 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.019
 which automatically frames the led then 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.610
 and I think it's a nice one 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.810
 thing in fashion so I can on everyone 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.840
 In case you only recommend 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.880
 the weather machine took in variations 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.410
 has to lead with their rides or 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.510
 one with the truck logo or maybe 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.450
 even a flag has a background 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.280
 I'm only holding the white name 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.720
 may help a bit boring 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.329
 ever smaller cinemas and cool colored ones 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.220
 LED frame drum make it all there 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.450
 cool again and yes download link from 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.620
 I can find courage in the description 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.480
 you definitely recommend this 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.829

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.829
