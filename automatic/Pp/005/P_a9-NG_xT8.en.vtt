I<00:00:09.139> believe<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.349> number<00:00:10.889> six<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:13.309> I've<00:00:14.309> heard

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I believe it's number six and I've heard

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.790 
I believe it's number six and I've heard
that<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.540> guess<00:00:15.809> impossible<00:00:16.529> or<00:00:16.710> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
that it's like I guess impossible or you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.970 
that it's like I guess impossible or you
can't<00:00:18.109> grind<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.320> number<00:00:20.070> six<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.980> here's

can't grind out number six and here's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.429 
can't grind out number six and here's
proof<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:26.180> use<00:00:27.180> CR<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.080> took<00:00:28.260> out

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
proof that you can use CR we took out

proof that you can use CR we took out
this<00:00:30.109> screw<00:00:31.109> right<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.969> this<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.120> right

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
this screw right here and this one right

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:45.040 
this screw right here and this one right
here<00:00:34.219> is<00:00:35.219> already<00:00:35.460> loose

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.430 

we<00:00:45.290> did

we did

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.500 
we did
see<00:00:47.130> it's<00:00:47.940> spinning

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
see it's spinning

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
see I grinded it right here I think it's

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.740
