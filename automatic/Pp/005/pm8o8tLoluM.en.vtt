build a few guys we have a 3412 if you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.410 
build a few guys we have a 3412 if you
haven't<00:00:13.950> tried<00:00:14.009> three<00:00:14.340> four<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.670> two<00:00:14.700> it's

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
haven't tried three four one two it's

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.609 
haven't tried three four one two it's
effectively<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.590> exactly<00:00:17.340> same<00:00:17.520> as<00:00:17.900> 352<00:00:18.900> but

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
effectively I'm exactly same as 352 but

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.099 
effectively I'm exactly same as 352 but
it's<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.670> bit<00:00:20.820> cheaper<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> recommend<00:00:21.720> it

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it's a bit cheaper so I recommend it

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's a bit cheaper so I recommend it
really<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.890> your<00:00:23.070> players<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.369> slightly

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
really all your players are slightly

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.970 
really all your players are slightly
cheaper<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> less<00:00:24.750> desirable

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
cheaper because it's a less desirable

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.029
