00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
dry for a couple hours and then use that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.560 
dry for a couple hours and then use that
to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.809> bottom<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> push

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

to the bottom of that and then you push
it<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.590> pretty<00:00:47.010> good<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.520> it's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it on and it's pretty good like it's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.690
