hi<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:06.899> Sam<00:00:07.259> green<00:00:07.620> lime<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:08.010> euromold

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
hi this is Sam green lime at euromold

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
hi this is Sam green lime at euromold
2012<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.870> behind<00:00:10.679> me<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.219> can<00:00:11.370> see<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.150> new

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
2012 and behind me we can see the new

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.530 
2012 and behind me we can see the new
object<00:00:12.750> 1000<00:00:13.500> wide<00:00:14.130> format<00:00:14.549> 3d<00:00:15.179> printing

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
object 1000 wide format 3d printing

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.210 
object 1000 wide format 3d printing
system<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
system as you can see this is the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490 
system as you can see this is the
largest<00:00:17.670> machine<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.449> object<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:18.990> ever<00:00:19.230> made

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
largest machine the object has ever made

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.310 
largest machine the object has ever made
and<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.150> closer<00:00:21.660> inside<00:00:22.140> we

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
and if we get a look closer inside we

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.429 
and if we get a look closer inside we
can<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.550> nice<00:00:23.760> large<00:00:24.630> size<00:00:24.960> racing

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
can see a very nice large size racing

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
can see a very nice large size racing
car<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.710> we've<00:00:25.800> 3d<00:00:26.010> printed<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
car that we've 3d printed for you in the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:39.200 
car that we've 3d printed for you in the
virile<00:00:27.510> white<00:00:27.660> material<00:00:27.930> come<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> look

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.540 

so<00:00:40.210> this<00:00:40.390> object<00:00:40.840> wide-format<00:00:41.680> 3d<00:00:42.190> printing

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
so this object wide-format 3d printing

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.140 
so this object wide-format 3d printing
system<00:00:42.940> is<00:00:43.630> called<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:43.960> object<00:00:44.260> 1000

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
system is called the object 1000

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.550 
system is called the object 1000
obviously<00:00:46.150> because<00:00:46.300> it's<00:00:46.570> got<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.720> 1000

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
obviously because it's got a 1000

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.530 
obviously because it's got a 1000
millimeter<00:00:47.890> built<00:00:48.490> ray<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:49.210> exact

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
millimeter built ray the exact

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.110 
millimeter built ray the exact
dimensions<00:00:49.720> are<00:00:50.230> actually<00:00:50.530> 1000<00:00:51.490> on<00:00:51.610> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
dimensions are actually 1000 on the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.080 
dimensions are actually 1000 on the
x-axis<00:00:52.450> eight<00:00:53.350> hundred<00:00:53.800> millimeters<00:00:54.310> on<00:00:54.550> the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
x-axis eight hundred millimeters on the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.020 
x-axis eight hundred millimeters on the
y-axis<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.900> 500<00:00:56.590> millimeters<00:00:57.130> on<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.790> depth

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
y-axis and 500 millimeters on the depth

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.530 
y-axis and 500 millimeters on the depth
or<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.360> z-axis<00:00:58.560> so<00:00:59.560> it's<00:01:00.220> actually<00:01:00.460> in<00:01:01.150> terms

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
or the z-axis so it's actually in terms

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.390 
or the z-axis so it's actually in terms
of<00:01:01.690> volume<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.200> can<00:01:02.350> print<00:01:02.620> models<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.370> are

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
of volume you can print models that are

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.640 
of volume you can print models that are
ten<00:01:03.670> times<00:01:03.940> larger<00:01:04.270> than<00:01:04.750> anything<00:01:05.530> that's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
ten times larger than anything that's

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.770 
ten times larger than anything that's
come<00:01:05.860> out<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.310> object<00:01:06.640> connects<00:01:07.060> 500

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
come out of the object connects 500

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.960 
come out of the object connects 500
which<00:01:08.260> is<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.650> next<00:01:08.950> largest<00:01:09.130> 3d<00:01:09.670> printing

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
which is the next largest 3d printing

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.469 
which is the next largest 3d printing
system<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:11.260> we<00:01:11.380> have<00:01:11.619> in<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.890> object<00:01:12.010> range

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
system that we have in the object range

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.969 
system that we have in the object range
so<00:01:13.479> let's<00:01:14.080> see<00:01:14.200> what<00:01:14.229> else<00:01:14.350> we<00:01:14.590> can<00:01:14.680> see<00:01:14.860> that

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
so let's see what else we can see that

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.800 
so let's see what else we can see that
come<00:01:15.280> out<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> object<00:01:15.850> 1000<00:01:16.420> here<00:01:16.540> today

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
come out of the object 1000 here today

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.440 
come out of the object 1000 here today
follow<00:01:17.320> me<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:18.310> here's<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.700> couple<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.090> examples

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
follow me so here's a couple of examples

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.109 
follow me so here's a couple of examples

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
of the sort of 3d printed prototypes and

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.030 
of the sort of 3d printed prototypes and
models<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:23.110> we've<00:01:23.259> got<00:01:23.440> coming<00:01:23.710> out<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.920> the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
models that we've got coming out of the

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.690 
models that we've got coming out of the
object<00:01:24.310> 1000<00:01:24.940> here<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> full-size<00:01:26.700> car
