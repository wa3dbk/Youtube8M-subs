00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:29.469
 rounded that is our movie 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:32.929
 facilitating its application 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.109
 before removing the plastic film 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.240
 Quino, you'll see that it's a good tactic. 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:42.020
 more resistant, no 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.999

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.779
 using extra brightness of the star zinho mega 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:52.939

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.039
 goes a finger even you are not even 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.169
 use nail tip 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:04.069
 you're pulling that film is going already 

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:06.829
 leaving the plastic 'fifth you 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.259
 going pulling does not need a spatula 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.520
 no object with everything she's already 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.380
 leaving with the tip of the nail 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.290

 Look how she's seeing a lot 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.710
 brilliant goal I have to wait for the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.640
 Enamel dry well it already dried because 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.550

 apply on the nail by pressing the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:46.720
 center for the sides always 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.430
 so no film will judge or 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.460
 to be misplaced 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:58.720
