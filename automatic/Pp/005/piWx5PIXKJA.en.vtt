00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.760
 so today I purchased a starway tablet 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.200
 andromeda s8 130 mini 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.820
 right on the job decided to look 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.539
 the most you show what is 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 inside and run small 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.840
 indicative testik here at benchmark 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.470
 see which result produces data 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.470
 tablet means proceed to unpacking 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:40.710
 we have a tablet all 17 and 9 inches 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 it means it is the size of the edges of the frame 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.280
 narrow here a little wider camera go 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.219
 we have 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 front-rear standard connector set 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.930
 including bluetooth on January 4th 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.690
 Further on the configuration goes with us 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:11.479
 warranty card usb and micro 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.110
 yusb cable from the game cable cheholchik here 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.020
 such 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:21.820
 and additional protective film 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.820
 here we have a charger 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.020
 good standard equipment 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.679
 I like it now let's run the tablet itself 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.679
 we'll see 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:46.110
 so the tablet behind us is made of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.110
 metal it usually puts the name 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.700
 cool here is very screen apis matrix 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.110
 the resolution of this tablet is 1024 by 768 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:11.470
 bright cool screen 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.470
 see how many colors 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.500
 before that, I certainly installed 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.040
 so as not to delay the benchmark process i 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.040
 run 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.390
 so we start the test 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:06.480
 while we are testing the processor 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.180
 memory further without graphics can be said 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.099
 about the tablet that it is equipped 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:20.939
 RAM in size 1 gigabyte 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.280
 and the internal memory is 8 gigabytes of course 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:28.549
 you can use 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:32.670
 I insert sd cards here without problems 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.560
 Part of the tablet external modems flash drives 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 through about such cable 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.000
 so we wait android 4 2 stands here 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.680
 we went to the schedule 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.260
 I took a white color tablet like us 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:11.330
 not at all like it like white 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.990
 color we have a test graphic 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.990
 processor 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.720
 that they still have a little bit left 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.710
 how long is the testing 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.710
 write speed to sd card 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.310
 interesting test 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.080
 everything is already guided by points 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:46.449
 in this, that is, that is, how much he will give 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.449
 her like this 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.510
 how great is this performance so 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:06:01.210
 here we issued 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:06:06.660
 17 1638 to say directly that it is very 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:12.160
 very good result in principle 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.810
 This device is a quad 1800 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.180
 megahertz him therefore in the process 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:21.910
 In principle, such a result is not surprising. 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:28.050
 very good result so i produced 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.050
 Such a small reviewer on this all
