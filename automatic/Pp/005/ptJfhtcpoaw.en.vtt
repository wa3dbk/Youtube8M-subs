00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
think that's right right there they go

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.150 
think that's right right there they go
on<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.860> see<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.270> there's<00:02:38.170> also<00:02:38.410> he

on like that see and there's also he

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.470 
on like that see and there's also he
makes<00:02:39.430> stiffener<00:02:40.560> fire<00:02:41.580> which<00:02:42.580> might<00:02:43.450> be

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
makes stiffener fire which might be

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.050 
makes stiffener fire which might be
wrong<00:02:43.780> oh<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.260> know<00:02:44.350> me<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.800> am<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.310> believe

they<00:02:46.210> go<00:02:46.330> on<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.710> these<00:02:47.710> are<00:02:47.830> carbon

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
they go on like this these are carbon

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.300 
they go on like this these are carbon
fiber<00:02:48.400> stiffeners<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.740> when<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:50.830> both<00:02:51.070> down

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
fiber stiffeners and when you both down

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.980 
fiber stiffeners and when you both down
your<00:02:52.260> your<00:02:53.260> mouths<00:02:53.670> your<00:02:54.670> bolding<00:02:55.120> through

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
your your mouths your bolding through

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.690 
your your mouths your bolding through
the<00:02:56.110> carbon<00:02:56.500> fiber<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.100> through<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> carbon

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
the carbon fiber and through the carbon

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.190 
the carbon fiber and through the carbon
fiber<00:02:57.910> which<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.330> makes<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.690> insanely

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
fiber which just makes it insanely

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.610 
fiber which just makes it insanely
strong<00:02:59.710> which<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.370> good<00:03:01.110> turbine<00:03:02.110> guys<00:03:02.350> know<00:03:02.590> I

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
strong which is good turbine guys know I

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.170 
strong which is good turbine guys know I
talk<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.010> lot<00:03:03.160> these<00:03:03.490> are<00:03:03.670> pretty<00:03:03.850> cool<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.090> think

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
talk a lot these are pretty cool I think

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.940 
talk a lot these are pretty cool I think
these<00:03:04.480> will<00:03:04.630> work<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:05.050> further<00:03:05.470> than<00:03:05.680> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
these will work on further than the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.970 
these will work on further than the
turbine<00:03:06.370> guys<00:03:06.580> also<00:03:06.930> well<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.290> these<00:03:08.770> are

turbine guys also well and these are

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.130 
turbine guys also well and these are
just<00:03:09.010> especially<00:03:09.460> made<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.510> phone<00:03:10.780> one

messing around with the f-86 by eflite

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.940 
messing around with the f-86 by eflite
and<00:03:40.110> I've<00:03:41.110> been<00:03:41.230> trying<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.590> kinds<00:03:41.650> of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
and I've been trying all kinds of

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.640 
and I've been trying all kinds of
different<00:03:42.040> motors<00:03:42.550> in<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.140> 70<00:03:44.140> millimeter

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
different motors in and 70 millimeter

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.290 
different motors in and 70 millimeter
I've<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:45.030> ATT<00:03:46.030> 70<00:03:46.630> mm

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
I've a ATT 70 mm

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.680 
I've a ATT 70 mm
and<00:03:47.590> right<00:03:48.590> now<00:03:48.740> I<00:03:48.770> just<00:03:48.860> got<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.510> little<00:03:50.510> out

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
and right now I just got a little out

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.390 
and right now I just got a little out
runner<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.200> your<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.410> skin<00:03:51.620> about<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.860> thousand

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
runner and your it skin about a thousand

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.270 
runner and your it skin about a thousand
watts<00:03:52.580> on<00:03:52.790> five<00:03:53.690> cells<00:03:54.050> so<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:54.890> have<00:03:55.010> pretty

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
watts on five cells so you have pretty

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.640 
watts on five cells so you have pretty
cool<00:03:55.430> stuff<00:03:55.730> there<00:03:55.970> in<00:03:56.780> here<00:03:57.200> what<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.530> gonna

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
cool stuff there in here what I'm gonna
