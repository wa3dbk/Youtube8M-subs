00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello friends this time I'll show you 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.280
 how to make a nice hairstyle very easy 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.110
 for your graduation your 15 years for your 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.140
 wedding or for whatever the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.420
 Occasion many congratulations I hope you 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.210
 like it and let's start 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.970
 I will start by making a partition from the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.250
 front towards the nape of the neck and the other 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.640
 side too and separated with a clamp 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:35.400
 He continued to pull out at the top a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.400
 square and separated it with a clamp 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.170
 we separated the back with a 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.110
 clamp I will make a vertical partition behind 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.250
 from the ear to the crown this is 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.290
 will make both sides separated with pliers 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.780
 will continue taking small pictures of 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.770
 hair and will apply mousse to 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.870
 then go rolling from the growth 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.989
 to the tip of the hair and then 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.790
 I will place a pin took another box 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.820
 of hair can also say 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.250
 rolling from the tip to the root 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.680
 but I think it will be easier if 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.110
 roll from root to tip 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.320
 try both techniques to see which one 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 it's easier, I'm going rolling 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.860
 from the tip to the root and placing 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.340
 a pin 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.620
 so we will go rolling for small 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.900
 squares all sections already 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.800
 separated 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.530
 This technique is called rings or 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.190
 anchovies if you do not roll up is the growth 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.320
 that will give more volume in this area and if 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.710
 not rolled from the tip you will have left 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.930
 a more natural curl I think this 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 technique can get you out of many 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.630
 problems if you do not have any other 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.540
 tool like be good and pipes irons 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.360
 of dough since the pins can be 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.270
 find very easily and they are very 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.659
 economic and this technique does not harm your 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.539
 hair 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.030
 I 'll just leave the rings a couple of 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.569
 minutes but how convenient is 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.400
 perform them one night before the event 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.060
 If it's too early or with some good 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.420
 hours in advance so it will last you all 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.080
 the day 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.560
 the hairstyle now I remove one of the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.900
 rings you see how a curl has formed 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.629
 with volume from growth and very 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.970
 natural little by little we are withdrawing 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.560
 all the pins and continues leaving 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.560
 every curl in many more 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.580
 and little by little we are removing the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.780
 pins and we continue leaving each 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.780
 curls in many more 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.840
 after having removed all the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.010
 rings and brushing with my fingers the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.010
 hair back 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.670
 then on top of pancake or 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.670
 Carl I will give the hair if I wish 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.930
 on one side and winding little to 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.370
 little hair towards the neck coming 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.370
 about half 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.739
 this would be a first option to roll 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:22.680
 hair in half and hold with a 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.699
 inner section of hair making a 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.520
 knot or two and placing pins in xy 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.130
 leaving the rest of the hair loose 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.160
 so we would give a more modern touch to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.389
 combing leaving half loose and the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.389
 half collected 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.960
 although another option is to carry a bit of 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.050
 hair back and hold very well 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.270
 with pins and ready remember that you 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.350
 you can give the turn that you want to your 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.410
 hairstyle with these very natural curls 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.500
 here I have only been lifting and covering the 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.080
 end of the hairstyle with the same curls and 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.930
 placing a nice accessory in the form of 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.110
 flower although you can place a crown 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.810
 flowers and so on the accessory you want 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.600
 good friends and friends I hope that you 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.850
 have liked and congratulations to all 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.280

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.130
 years they get married or they will have a 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.100
 very special event congratulations to all 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.560
 them this hairstyle I did it especially 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.100
 because I think it's very beautiful and easy to 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.890
 do and you will not need much and you 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.150
