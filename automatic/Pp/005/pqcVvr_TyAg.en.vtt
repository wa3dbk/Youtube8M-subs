00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
anything like that this is actually

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.140

happening<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.540> real<00:01:30.750> life<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.710> might<00:01:31.979> be

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
happening in real life but this might be

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.510 
happening in real life but this might be

in training and account and this here is

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.580 
in training and account and this here is
the<00:01:49.500> hack<00:01:49.710> code<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.540> only<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.899> order

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the hack code and this is only for order

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.910 
the hack code and this is only for order
for<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.100> games<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.390> i<00:01:54.659> pre-ordered

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
for me be games like it if i pre-ordered

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.880 
for me be games like it if i pre-ordered
from<00:01:56.750> from<00:01:57.750> Best<00:01:57.960> Buy<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.170> that's<00:01:58.619> where<00:01:58.799> I'm

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
from from Best Buy but that's where I'm

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.569 
from from Best Buy but that's where I'm
fearing<00:01:59.280> from<00:02:00.229> no<00:02:01.229> reason<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.710> because<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
fearing from no reason just because I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.940 
fearing from no reason just because I
save<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.689> more<00:02:03.990> money<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.500> Best<00:02:04.770> Buy

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
save actually more money with Best Buy

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
save actually more money with Best Buy
than<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.939> EB<00:02:06.329> Games

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
than I would with EB Games

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.259 
than I would with EB Games
even<00:02:07.680> though<00:02:08.090> personally<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.619> rather

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.149 

pre-order<00:02:15.269> from<00:02:15.510> eb<00:02:15.900> games<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> main

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
pre-order from eb games but the main

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.009 
pre-order from eb games but the main
reason<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.549> that<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.849> because<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.510> Canadian

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
reason for that is because it's Canadian

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.229 
reason for that is because it's Canadian
I'm<00:02:19.260> Canadian<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.040> love<00:02:20.340> Canada<00:02:20.580> who<00:02:21.390> doesn't
