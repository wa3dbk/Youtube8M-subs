 you a very requested application that was 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.099
 continental funai or known as 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 as c9 is the one that is now in 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.379
 open beta phase this even the poet 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 you can also test the links 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.550
 are in the description and in this game you will 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 find four classes 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 this here is the classic typical mix 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 magic with physics is this is the magic 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.670
 we are the representative of the magic class 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.009
 of the game as well as the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.290
 rangers that not only is he an archer but 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.340
 also using water as 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 see and fire that barbarous mind right if 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.989
 They paid attention to detail that I talked me 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.899
 not mm and the exact one is a multiplayer 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.789
 online is an action game or is it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 very similar to the suit in question 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.770
 online compared to other rpgs but 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.930
 those who are fans of the genre rec - lech 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.829
 will find similarities with many others 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.820
 because he is basically this hankins lech 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.829
 online multiplayer with rpg elements 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.080
 How can you see the question of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 character customization he is 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.119
 exceptional very varied demonstrated 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.900
 several aspects and it is clear 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.150
 good to assemble the classes they are 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.100
 locked by gender so that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.750
 that you can not change the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 masculine and feminine in them 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.490
 happy with what you have and explore the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.100
 maximum of the tool which is very wide 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 besides of course bring not only things 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.070
 basic and good too expensive stuff is 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.189
 Crazy that Batman said the craziest is the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.280
 Batman understood very crazy. 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.680
 simple so then but ending 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 character let's go to the game after 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.729
 finish the customization after a few 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.530
 two or three hours basically right will 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.210
 for the surgery of the game will explain a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.159
 little in history I honestly do not 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 I caught too much even I'll tell you that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.420
 like every game here and do not 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.009
 to expect Anatoly is not his forte 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.540
 but it gives you an idea of ​​what 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.579
 is really going on I do not 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.130
 attached to her what to me is a point 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.570
 negative to every game I'm going to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.270
 lose time as mainly 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.270
 experiences like this where the online 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.989
 law is clear from the two 11 roots and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.679
 everything else 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.110
 I'll have my experience 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.400
 then singleplayer would like the plot 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.290
 the aspect I would say is a point 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.150
 negative because many feel trapped by it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.460
 not even at any time because 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.160
 dubbing for the characters at a time 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.200
 only at the moment of combat 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.360
 but the movement you can see that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.970
 no wsd for who was still 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.160
 wondering if it's only logical for pc is a 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.020
 fibroid mm , the overall 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.110
 in addition it will have the movement 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.660
 using the space will give some 10x 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.910
 some of the special features and attacks 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
 are per click using the mouse 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.780
 besides that your skills will not 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.970
 access through hotkeys using 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 pressing 12 and so on 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.450
 objects are very interactive and will 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.459
 have parts that part as you have seen 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.020
 well finished even to use 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.120
 of obstacles on the way 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.520
 the quest once given by the cene people 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.770
 have the marked trajectory which facilitates 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.050
 much is clear but the index was to be 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.560
 wait once the focus of the game itself 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.200
 It's the same fight as rock slash as me. 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.320
 I then spoke of hordes of enemies 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.550
 sometimes a 23 sometimes literally 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.640
 hordes and hordes see if it is the introduction 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.860
 basic tutorial beyond a clear one 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.230
 mouse button and achievements will have 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.180
 also some special actions that will 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.160
 being able to change over the course of the game will 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.810
 pressing eff that is special to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.239
 attack the character once he 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 is on the floor and give a trodden there should 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.930
 record the jump in the lion's eye thing 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.940
 similar and for some classes will have 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.190
 some differentiated ones that later in the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.049
 pv p you will see why of course how it is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.140
 a game of this kind is to be expected 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.739
 if you have pvp is one of the great objectives 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.110
 it 's a thing that's cool is that 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.570
 clear forests they will have the inputs 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.810
 times or making attempts to 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.420
 they have their own proportionality 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.850
 of a very good size , very striking. 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.709
 gives a much richer experience the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.260
 game and will consist of picking up the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.450
 things in cities and to 10 are 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.450
 limited by level until experience goes 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.860
 to be within a good time instance is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.190
 very selective for those who 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.720
 knows or played and dude 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.250
 a pen that sells everything is blocked 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.530
 back home was not a good tip I 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.450
 I would say to you in the extinct of grace more 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.340
 I would have to use a lock 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.160
 petroleum of the region etc. 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.490
 but finally the fights with the boston well 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.110
 cool 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.259
 is the one that is already a level 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.520
 under the first of the game and it is legal to 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.229
 time you kill 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.270
 The boss still gives a lively 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.229
 animation so the slow motion type 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.849
 but as you can see the movement 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:44.220
 is very rich and dynamic, it encourages 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.180
 use of combos and depending on the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.770
 that you use will have a better 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.229
 yield a note as you can see 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.210
 it literally evaluates the 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.900
 your performance on top of your speed 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.090
 Attack / Defense Time Dodge looks 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.889
 it's all on the screen as you saw the luch 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.259
 also cool because it 's very noticeable you 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.630
 gain key and type this system of 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.960
 casino will open the chests and then see 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.669
 kan monkeys and has still others that 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.800
 same style will pick up bar that goes 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.500
 Exit has random inventory after 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.150
 It's pretty Japanese style, this game. 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.919
 I 'm not really mistaken, he's Korean. 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.650
 so even so even those 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.530
 bizarre things you saw in the hour of 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.289
 customization is another example of what 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.240
 You can see there is of course contact 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.210
 with other players but it is not that 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.250
 populous that neither most of the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.460
 criminals thousands of people 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.020
 it has multiple channels are up to ten channels 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.969
 to the server if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.370
 at the moment I only have one server in the 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.550
 united states and once in europe once 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.139
 that Tupi can look for the person of 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.139
 respective class after training in 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.659
 skill and this is cool that will win 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.550
 I am points and there after the waiter 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.770
 according to the mobility tree that goes 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.289
 developing your character and each 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.110
 class will then have targets where 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.849
 it will divide for subclasses right 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.340
 so despite having the moment only 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.259
 four you can make variations of it 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.159
 opting for example in this one that the 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.289
 my class 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.060
 she is a mixture of attack though 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.940
 physical and magical and then went to 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.680
 specialize in one or the other and 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.860
 so diversify your skills 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.509
 according to your style the armors are 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.880
 Well, they're very well designed. 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.699
 graphics are excellent the fluidity of the 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.069
 ground the drive of it see the wind 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.589
 hitting the trees they are moving 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:39.060
 character movement 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:39.810
 It's his body that's exceptional. 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.370
 time 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.919
 is in beta probably well to be 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.020
 make a free game I do not have 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.000
 sure and I believe he will come to 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.400
 be very successful even was like 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.590

 I really liked this is an analysis 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.180
 about him I do not intend to
