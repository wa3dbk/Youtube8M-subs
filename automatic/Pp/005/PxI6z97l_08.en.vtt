okay<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> tutorial

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
okay so I was going to do a tutorial

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.790 
okay so I was going to do a tutorial
today<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.150> then<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.330> changed<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:21.810> mind<00:00:22.080> because

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
today but then I changed my mind because

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.570 
today but then I changed my mind because
I<00:00:23.369> colored<00:00:24.000> my<00:00:24.060> hair<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.539> morning<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.580> I

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.790 
I colored my hair this morning and I
decided<00:00:27.090> instead<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.990> tutorial<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.619> talk

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
decided instead of a tutorial to talk

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.919 
decided instead of a tutorial to talk
about<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.160> year<00:00:29.340> color<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.630> isn't

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
Sheen which I actually think it does I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.320

think<00:03:33.770> this<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.190> works<00:03:34.490> so<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.120> put<00:03:35.300> that

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
think this really works so you put that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.140 
think this really works so you put that
in<00:03:35.480> there<00:03:35.720> with<00:03:35.930> your<00:03:36.110> developer<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.800> your

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.020 
in there with your developer and your
color<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.800> then<00:03:39.800> it<00:03:39.830> also<00:03:40.250> comes<00:03:40.430> with

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030

you'll see it in my coming videos over
the<00:04:24.500> next<00:04:24.530> few<00:04:24.890> weeks<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.370> we'll<00:04:25.550> see

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
the next few weeks but we'll see

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.129 
the next few weeks but we'll see
usually<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.850> about<00:04:27.180> two<00:04:27.540> weeks<00:04:27.780> between

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
usually have about two weeks between

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.770 
usually have about two weeks between
when<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.010> color<00:04:29.760> my<00:04:29.850> hair<00:04:30.000> with<00:04:30.270> permanent

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
when I color my hair with permanent

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.560 
when I color my hair with permanent
color<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.290> then<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.830> have<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.940> use<00:04:33.540> a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
color and then I have to use a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.480 
color and then I have to use a
semi-permanent<00:04:34.080> color<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.950> brighten<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.340> up

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
semi-permanent color to brighten it up

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.550 
semi-permanent color to brighten it up
so<00:04:35.760> we'll<00:04:35.910> see<00:04:36.150> if<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.540> color<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.990> extended

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
so we'll see if the color is extended

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.770 
so we'll see if the color is extended
any<00:04:37.710> longer<00:04:38.130> either<00:04:38.970> way<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.120> really<00:04:39.450> like<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
any longer either way I really like the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.150 
any longer either way I really like the
initial<00:04:40.139> application<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.919> that's<00:04:40.980> to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
initial application and that's to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.290 
initial application and that's to
continue<00:04:41.580> using<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:43.730> so<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.790> get<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.240> and

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
continue using it so you get this and

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.360 
continue using it so you get this and
you<00:04:45.540> mix<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.020> with<00:04:46.169> your<00:04:46.410> color<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.100> your
