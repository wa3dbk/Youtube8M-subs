is<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.869> really<00:01:17.290> important<00:01:17.920> part<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.520> this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
is a really important part of this

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.280 
is a really important part of this
simple<00:01:19.630> syrup<00:01:20.080> as<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:21.399> boils<00:01:21.940> over<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.110> next

simple syrup as this boils over the next

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.680 
simple syrup as this boils over the next
hour<00:01:23.590> hour<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.220> half<00:01:24.430> it's<00:01:25.119> gonna<00:01:25.240> prevent

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
hour hour and a half it's gonna prevent

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.980 
hour hour and a half it's gonna prevent
my<00:01:25.929> sugar<00:01:26.289> from<00:01:26.560> crystallizing<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> my<00:01:28.630> peel

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
my sugar from crystallizing so my peel

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.490 
my sugar from crystallizing so my peel
will<00:01:29.619> be<00:01:29.709> more<00:01:29.950> soft<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.729> chewy<00:01:31.259> okay<00:01:32.259> let's

so I want to keep these peels submerged
in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> syrup<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.350> easiest<00:01:40.680> way<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
in the syrup the easiest way to do that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
in the syrup the easiest way to do that
find<00:01:42.149> a<00:01:42.299> lid<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.500> smaller

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
find a lid that's a little bit smaller
