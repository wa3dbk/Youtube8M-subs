00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.539 
happy he looks very fluid I will keep
that<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.590> mind<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.189> inspiring

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that in mind that's a good inspiring

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
that in mind that's a good inspiring
picture<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.119> things<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.540> happen<00:01:48.810> before<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
picture of things that happen before and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
picture of things that happen before and
I<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:49.829> legacy<00:01:50.369> sometimes<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I think it is about legacy sometimes and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
I think it is about legacy sometimes and
to<00:01:51.420> continue<00:01:51.810> things<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> move<00:01:52.590> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
to continue things on and to move on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
to continue things on and to move on
forward<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> best<00:01:53.460> possible<00:01:53.610> way<00:01:53.909> that's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
