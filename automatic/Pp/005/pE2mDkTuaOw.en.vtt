you're going to count one two three and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.460 
you're going to count one two three and
then<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> next<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
is gonna go like that and now this light

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.700 
is gonna go like that and now this light
colored<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.300> go<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.509> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.160

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
then the fifth line is going to turn

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.940 
then the fifth line is going to turn
like<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.810> you're<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.410> turn<00:02:11.620> this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
like that now you're going to turn this

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.449 
like that now you're going to turn this
dark<00:02:12.280> blue<00:02:12.610> one<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.420> two<00:02:13.690> match

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
dark blue one so that these two match

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:25.540 
dark blue one so that these two match
like<00:02:15.459> that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.720 

finally<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:27.180> dark<00:02:28.050> blue<00:02:28.440> one's<00:02:28.710> gonna<00:02:28.950> go<00:02:29.100> up

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.250 

and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.360> shell<00:02:35.690> but<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.110> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
have another one you can go on top to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.540 
have another one you can go on top to
make<00:02:41.100> n<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.300> heater
