00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 so that's the ds5 topic 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.740
 ls I saw that in photo I can 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 predict that I was very seduced by 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.880
 what many of you were not 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.109
 no more first impressions at the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.670
 true clairvoyance you know these lava it's 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.460
 the ds that is reserved for the Chinese market 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.300
 including a three-box with a very coach 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300
 bagnols today 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.320
 and because it's the segment that works 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.730
 there I found that in the photos 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 it was massive but there I find 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.420
 she has more presence more guys 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.390
 so that's really important because 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.650
 that it is the signature of the mark ds 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 that we are likely to see everywhere 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.020
 low and it's still good 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.760
 you know that carlos the base that nature 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 nick took over the group he did not 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 hesitated the first decision he made 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.200
 life is no doubt esh 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.400
 becomes a brand in itself 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.620
 the case in China it was not decided 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.989
 in France that's it he immediately 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 says everything and we stop so ds will become 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.370
 the citroÃ«n audit as and when 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.310
 years it takes time but I believe 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.350
 that we can understand by sending the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.210
 the car is so they have it when 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.829
 same penalty dashboard 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.890
 specific for the first time there is 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.740
 you think gps1 explained it's wood 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.630
 open port this barbaric word that means 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.659
 that he is not allowed it is to give 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.530
 the impression of authenticity 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.750
 hello you like yes yes because they 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.409
 have mixed they picked up the dials 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.689
 from the ds5 a little from the console of the ds 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.450
 kdh rizon federation of learned mixes 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.009
 well there we are we are more classic in 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.590
 definitions because it's meant 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.110
 it's always the same for the for the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.270
 China but again it comes back 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.220
 still much better than on the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.909
 photocells rats should know that the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.880
 seats at the back 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.189
 you know the Chinese to 2 so we 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.510
 there is good without it has room 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.550
 it's made for chauffeur cars 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.390
 I always found we trumps 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.560
 photos 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.440
 essalouh which is a pleasure 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.040
 automotive 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.840
 I will be there 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.560
 but you have to sell it you have to leave 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.450
 his luck to the product as said in 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.610
 what begins in sousse 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.470
 no it's not the skirt at home 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.470
 not the neglected rage that we had stowed 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.950
 maybe a little too classic but 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.950
 I think it does it
