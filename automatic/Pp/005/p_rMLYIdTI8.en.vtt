keeps<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.520> it's<00:03:25.640> taking<00:03:26.090> this

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
keeps on going and so it's taking this

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.640

down<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.940> different<00:04:06.180> cities<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.690> think<00:04:07.050> it's

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
down in in different cities I think it's

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.890 
down in in different cities I think it's
it<00:04:07.890> does<00:04:08.100> take<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.610> lot<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.300> legwork<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.780> it

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
it does take a lot of legwork and it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.200 
it does take a lot of legwork and it
takes<00:04:10.110> constant<00:04:10.550> volunteers<00:04:11.550> every<00:04:11.760> week<00:04:12.030> but
