okay<00:00:02.370> so<00:00:02.429> here<00:00:02.700> are<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.090> rollerblade<00:00:03.720> tempest

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay so here are the rollerblade tempest

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.610 
okay so here are the rollerblade tempest
100's<00:00:04.799> on<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.130> floor<00:00:05.400> D<00:00:05.940> wheeled<00:00:06.500> with<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
100's on the floor D wheeled with the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.919 
100's on the floor D wheeled with the
posts<00:00:08.069> already<00:00:08.250> taken<00:00:08.700> out<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.750> wheels

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
posts already taken out and the wheels

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.690 
posts already taken out and the wheels
have<00:00:10.139> been<00:00:10.170> placed<00:00:10.530> exactly<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.639> were

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
have been placed exactly how they were

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.640 
have been placed exactly how they were
aligned<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.660> course<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.110> difference<00:00:13.410> being

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
aligned of course the difference being

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.750 
aligned of course the difference being
these<00:00:14.219> were<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.790> outside<00:00:15.420> facing<00:00:16.369> sides<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
these were the outside facing sides of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.590 
these were the outside facing sides of
the<00:00:17.970> wheels<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.670> typically<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.330> skate

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the wheels so typically in a skate

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.779 
the wheels so typically in a skate
situation<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.740> didn't<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.369> 90

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
situation if you didn't have this 90

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.839 
situation if you didn't have this 90
millimeter<00:00:24.210> rocker<00:00:24.539> wheel<00:00:25.189> against<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> 300

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
millimeter rocker wheel against the 300

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.170 
millimeter rocker wheel against the 300
millimeters<00:00:27.680> you<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:29.670> typically<00:00:30.150> take<00:00:30.619> and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
millimeters you would typically take and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.209 
millimeters you would typically take and
swap<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.809> then<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.219> with

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
swap this with this and then this with

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.520 
swap this with this and then this with
this<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:39.570> obviously<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.020> gonna<00:00:40.260> work

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
this but that's obviously not gonna work

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.319 
this but that's obviously not gonna work
because<00:00:41.010> you've<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.610> chassis<00:00:42.059> point

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
because you've got this chassis point

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.650 
because you've got this chassis point
which<00:00:42.570> hangs<00:00:42.840> low<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.829> maybe<00:00:44.399> put<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.239> back

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
which hangs low so maybe put that back

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.319 
which hangs low so maybe put that back
the<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:49.550> all<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:53.180> right<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the way it was all right so all right so

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
the way it was all right so all right so
I<00:00:55.050> guess<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I guess what I want to do is I want to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.660 
I guess what I want to do is I want to
get<00:00:56.699> my<00:00:58.430> best<00:00:59.430> shaped<00:00:59.760> wheel<00:01:00.030> into<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> front

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
get my best shaped wheel into the front

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.280 
get my best shaped wheel into the front
I'm<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:02.820> sure<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.899> honest

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
I'm not sure which one that is be honest

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
I'm not sure which one that is be honest
might<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.570> seems<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> have

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
might be the back one this seems to have

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.330 
might be the back one this seems to have
the<00:01:08.310> most<00:01:08.549> consistent<00:01:09.299> wear<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> would

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the most consistent wear but that would

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.740 
the most consistent wear but that would
imply<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.909> guy's<00:01:12.150> gonna<00:01:12.360> stay<00:01:12.600> exactly

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
imply that this guy's gonna stay exactly

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.820 
imply that this guy's gonna stay exactly
where<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:14.780> yeah<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.140> tough<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:17.780> okay

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
where he is yeah that's a tough one okay

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.300 
where he is yeah that's a tough one okay
well<00:01:19.860> mez<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.369> make<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> call<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:22.009> if<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.159> look

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
well mez will make a call here if I look

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
well mez will make a call here if I look
at<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.930> yeah<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> rear<00:01:25.290> wheels<00:01:25.500> are

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
at this one yeah the rear wheels are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
at this one yeah the rear wheels are
definitely<00:01:26.280> getting<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> least<00:01:26.790> amount<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
definitely getting the least amount of

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.109 
definitely getting the least amount of
use<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> let's<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.310> we're<00:01:29.820> gonna<00:01:29.909> take

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
use so let's do this we're gonna take

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.390 
use so let's do this we're gonna take
the<00:01:30.240> rear<00:01:30.420> wheel<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> front<00:01:31.860> take

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the rear wheel put it up the front take

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.140 
the rear wheel put it up the front take
the<00:01:32.490> front<00:01:32.700> wheel<00:01:32.909> put<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> back<00:01:35.150> can't

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the front wheel put it in the back can't

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960 
the front wheel put it in the back can't
swap<00:01:36.329> those<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.430> life

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
swap those two so that's life

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.990 
swap those two so that's life
okay<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.680> take<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> front<00:01:41.159> swap<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.970> with

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
okay so we take the front swap it with

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.170 
okay so we take the front swap it with
the<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.590> now<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:43.799> also<00:01:43.950> gonna<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the back now what I'm also gonna do is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.469 
the back now what I'm also gonna do is
I'm<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.450> switch<00:01:45.780> switch<00:01:46.439> them<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.479> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I'm gonna switch switch them to the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.840 
I'm gonna switch switch them to the
other<00:01:48.630> boots<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.680> I'll<00:01:50.009> stick<00:01:50.280> ready<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> put

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
other boots so I'll stick ready and put

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.039 
other boots so I'll stick ready and put
them<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.060> left<00:01:51.270> left<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.960> on

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
them on the left left you put them on

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.300 
them on the left left you put them on
the<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.060> now<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> here's<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> outside

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the right and now so here's the outside

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.819 
the right and now so here's the outside
facing<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> left<00:01:57.360> shoe<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.710> I'm

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
facing of the left shoe so what I'm

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
facing of the left shoe so what I'm
going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.119> these<00:02:00.240> back<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
going to do when I put these back in is

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.050 
going to do when I put these back in is
instead<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.530> having<00:02:01.680> them<00:02:02.070> facing<00:02:02.549> outward

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
instead of having them facing outward

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.660 
instead of having them facing outward
like<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.170> were<00:02:04.229> originally<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.369> flip

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
like they were originally I'm gonna flip

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.809 
like they were originally I'm gonna flip
them<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.670> edge

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
them like this so that the the edge

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.410 
them like this so that the the edge
that's<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:10.170> worn<00:02:10.560> gets<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.370> most<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.180> gets

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that's not worn gets the most it gets

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.320 
that's not worn gets the most it gets
the<00:02:12.540> most<00:02:12.690> angle<00:02:13.110> beating

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
the most angle beating

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.370 
the most angle beating
see<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:16.620> how<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.950> we've<00:02:17.700> got<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.540> we're

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
see see how that we've got the the we're

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.770 
see see how that we've got the the we're
edge<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:19.980> side<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.660> on

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
edge is on this side it's not as one on

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.030 
edge is on this side it's not as one on
this<00:02:21.900> side<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.380> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> make<00:02:22.680> sure<00:02:22.710> this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
this side so I'm going to make sure this

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.270 
this side so I'm going to make sure this
side<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> inside<00:02:25.670> make<00:02:26.670> sense

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
side is on the inside make sense

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.400 
side is on the inside make sense
and<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.400> I'm<00:02:29.460> going<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.610> rotate<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:29.940> wheels

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
and so I'm going to rotate my wheels

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.920 
and so I'm going to rotate my wheels
we'll<00:02:31.410> see<00:02:31.560> how<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.740> works<00:02:32.100> out<00:02:32.690> no<00:02:33.690> idea

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
we'll see how that works out no idea

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.010 
we'll see how that works out no idea
what<00:02:34.020> I'm<00:02:34.110> doing<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.440> these<00:02:34.530> new<00:02:34.680> skates
