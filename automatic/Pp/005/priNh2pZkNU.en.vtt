episodes already

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.610
seems like just yesterday I was part for
my nice comfortable job editing videos

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.150

humor on a weekly basis

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.789

haven't done any minute

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.789
you always your watching her to cast

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.600
with America's worst economic
environment for the Great Depression

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.400
Nissan is offering the cheapest car in
America the 2009 versa has an MSRP of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.580
nine thousand nine hundred ninety
dollars

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.650
which beats other economy cars like the
Hyundai Accent and Chevy avail

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.650
versus total passenger volume: also
exceeded competition

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.990
and with decent power and mileage
ratings it could be a good deal for

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.720
those in the market for cheap car

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.950
of course that is predicated on the
assumption that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.790
anyone will ever buy another car ever
October was a veritable bloodbath for

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.110

engine performance and fuel efficiency

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.860
