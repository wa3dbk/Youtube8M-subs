00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
seems a little bit like a threat but i'm

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.250 
seems a little bit like a threat but i'm
sure

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
sure

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.399 
sure
it's<00:02:18.409> not<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:18.920> kind<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:20.150> probably<00:02:21.110> one

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
it's not it's kind of just probably one

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's not it's kind of just probably one
of<00:02:21.439> those<00:02:21.769> things<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.280> someone<00:02:22.819> says<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
of those things that someone says and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.330 
of those things that someone says and
they<00:02:23.510> get<00:02:23.689> it<00:02:23.900> gets<00:02:24.110> completely<00:02:24.290> blown<00:02:25.040> up<00:02:25.220> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
they get it gets completely blown up and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.670 
they get it gets completely blown up and
everyone<00:02:25.640> goes<00:02:25.819> what<00:02:26.209> but<00:02:26.959> it's<00:02:27.079> kind<00:02:27.409> of<00:02:27.530> an

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
everyone goes what but it's kind of an

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.190 
everyone goes what but it's kind of an
obvious<00:02:28.220> statement<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:29.060> also<00:02:29.269> it's<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:29.870> very

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
obvious statement but also it's not very

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.619 
obvious statement but also it's not very
nice<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.680> hear<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.579> you<00:02:31.939> kind<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.329> always

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
nice to hear because you kind of always

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.110 
nice to hear because you kind of always
hope<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.920> symbol<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.549> keep<00:02:34.700> going<00:02:35.000> on

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
hope that the symbol just keep going on

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.390 
hope that the symbol just keep going on
and<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.569> on<00:02:35.659> and<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.379> really<00:02:36.739> hope<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.159> does

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
and on and on and I really hope it does

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.430 
and on and on and I really hope it does
but<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.060> guess<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.780> money<00:02:38.959> isn't<00:02:39.140> there

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
but I guess if the money isn't there

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280 
but I guess if the money isn't there
then<00:02:39.680> things<00:02:40.129> can't<00:02:40.579> keep<00:02:40.970> going<00:02:41.269> but<00:02:42.110> with

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
then things can't keep going but with

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.020 
then things can't keep going but with
the<00:02:42.470> amount<00:02:42.590> they've<00:02:43.099> charged<00:02:43.579> for<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.849> game

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
the amount they've charged for the game

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.920 
the amount they've charged for the game
I<00:02:44.650> pretty<00:02:45.650> sure<00:02:45.950> they'll<00:02:46.129> have<00:02:46.159> enough<00:02:46.549> cash

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
I pretty sure they'll have enough cash

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.360 
I pretty sure they'll have enough cash
