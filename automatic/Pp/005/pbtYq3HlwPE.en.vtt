now and then but I came up with a list
of<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> straw<00:00:26.490> hats<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> think

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of some of the straw hats that I think

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
of some of the straw hats that I think
will<00:00:27.359> die<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.840> well<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> couple<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> other

characters that aren't straw hats that I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.759 
characters that aren't straw hats that I
think<00:00:30.359> might<00:00:30.599> die<00:00:30.810> towards<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> end<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.679> the

you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.180> very<00:02:00.360> symbolic<00:02:01.049> again

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you know it would be very symbolic again

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.749 
you know it would be very symbolic again
that's<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.950> something<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.340> want<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
don't want to be honest I don't want to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.899 
don't want to be honest I don't want to
see<00:02:04.110> any<00:02:04.290> other<00:02:04.530> store<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:04.890> died<00:02:05.100> alone<00:02:05.490> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
see any other store has died alone so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.029 
see any other store has died alone so
once<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.360> become<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:07.140> such<00:02:07.619> amazing

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
once they become just such amazing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
once they become just such amazing
characters<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.390> does<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> happen

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
characters but if it does have to happen

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.540 
characters but if it does have to happen
and<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.679> again<00:02:10.770> towards<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> end<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and I think again towards the end of the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
and I think again towards the end of the
series<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:11.970> least<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.360> few<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> straw<00:02:12.900> hats

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
series at least a few of the straw hats

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.970 
series at least a few of the straw hats
will<00:02:13.290> die

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
will die

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.949 
will die
I<00:02:14.040> could<00:02:14.519> see<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.730> being<00:02:14.760> chopper<00:02:15.269> because<00:02:15.540> not

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
I could see it being chopper because not

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.050 
I could see it being chopper because not
only<00:02:15.989> do<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.800> as<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> symbolic<00:02:17.489> thing<00:02:17.819> but

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
only do I see it as a symbolic thing but

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.640 
only do I see it as a symbolic thing but
I<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.540> kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> try<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> look<00:02:19.409> at<00:02:19.560> the

after<00:02:42.720> being<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> straw<00:02:43.200> hat<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:43.560> obviously<00:02:44.340> I

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
after being a straw hat and obviously I

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.400

control<00:05:37.170> us<00:05:37.530> for<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.740> loop<00:05:37.950> he<00:05:38.160> could<00:05:38.310> do

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
control us for a loop he could do

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.280 
control us for a loop he could do
something<00:05:38.670> totally<00:05:38.970> different<00:05:39.150> but<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:39.870> really

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
something totally different but I really
