00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
items anything like that i'm actually

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.849 
items anything like that i'm actually
showing<00:00:05.730> off<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.990> kind<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.319> like<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> client

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
showing off it's kind of like a client

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.070 
showing off it's kind of like a client
what<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.160> guess<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.519> could<00:00:08.550> say<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.630> basically

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
what I guess you could say so basically

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.450 
what I guess you could say so basically
it<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.320> gives<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.800> whole<00:00:11.130> heap<00:00:11.370> of

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
it just gives you a whole heap of

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.100 
it just gives you a whole heap of
functionality<00:00:12.240> are<00:00:12.420> they<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.780> otherwise

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
functionality are they you otherwise

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.589 
functionality are they you otherwise
wouldn't<00:00:13.469> happen<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.950> aria<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.240> isn't

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
wouldn't happen to aria so it isn't

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.970 
wouldn't happen to aria so it isn't
actually<00:00:15.690> released<00:00:16.170> at<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> moment<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.800> is

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
actually released at the moment this is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.769 
actually released at the moment this is
just<00:00:17.130> pre<00:00:17.400> release<00:00:17.580> footage<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.449> kind<00:00:18.720> of

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
just pre release footage just to kind of

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
just pre release footage just to kind of
show<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.380> off<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.680> guys<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.070> get<00:00:20.670> an

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
show it off to you guys you know get an

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.900 
show it off to you guys you know get an
overall<00:00:21.119> consensus<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.080> people<00:00:22.560> think

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
overall consensus of what people think

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.240 
overall consensus of what people think
so<00:00:23.910> basically<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> replace<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
so basically you do have to replace the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
so basically you do have to replace the
terraria<00:00:26.670> DHC<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.900> still<00:00:28.230> uses<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.619> basic

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
terraria DHC but it still uses the basic

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
terraria DHC but it still uses the basic
trailer<00:00:29.490> HD<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.750> doesn't<00:00:31.050> actually

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
trailer HD so on it doesn't actually

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
trailer HD so on it doesn't actually
break<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.710> distribution<00:00:32.550> copyright<00:00:33.059> laws

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
break the distribution copyright laws

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
break the distribution copyright laws
that<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.630> very<00:00:34.050> actually<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.950> believe<00:00:34.980> but

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
that are very actually has I believe but

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.090 
that are very actually has I believe but
I<00:00:36.000> could<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.510> wrong<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.739> why<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:37.980> not

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
I could be wrong so that's why we're not

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.590 
I could be wrong so that's why we're not
actually<00:00:38.280> releasing<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> yet<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.360> not

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
actually releasing it yet with not

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
actually releasing it yet with not
actually<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.200> hundred<00:00:40.530> percent<00:00:40.739> sure<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
actually a hundred percent sure on the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
actually a hundred percent sure on the
whole<00:00:41.309> legality<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> desired<00:00:42.570> zap<00:00:42.960> now

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
whole legality of desired zap now

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350 
whole legality of desired zap now
basically<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> allows<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.180> if

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
basically what it allows you to do if

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600 
basically what it allows you to do if
you<00:00:45.570> run<00:00:45.870> tds<00:00:46.469> em<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> trailer

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

make<00:01:24.570> myself<00:01:24.750> walking<00:01:25.259> water<00:01:25.619> by<00:01:25.770> typing

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
make myself walking water by typing

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.390 
make myself walking water by typing
water<00:01:26.430> walk<00:01:29.960> like<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.159> isn't

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
water walk like so but this this isn't

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
water walk like so but this this isn't
even<00:01:32.700> close<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.140> with

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
even close to what we want to do with

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.249 
even close to what we want to do with
this<00:01:34.439> okay<00:01:34.770> our<00:01:35.340> idea<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> moment<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
this okay our idea at the moment is to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.370 
this okay our idea at the moment is to
basically<00:01:37.470> turn<00:01:38.040> terraria<00:01:39.000> into<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.659> MMO<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
basically turn terraria into an MMO so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
basically turn terraria into an MMO so
if<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.619> running<00:01:40.740> tds<00:01:41.280> em<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
if you're running tds em what we want to

could say as opposed to just finally I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.700 
could say as opposed to just finally I
mean<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.030> still<00:02:45.300> farm<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.500> there

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.120 
doing that very very soon and this this
little<00:04:12.720> more<00:04:12.989> actually<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.560> allows<00:04:13.799> us<00:04:14.010> to

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
little more actually that allows us to

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.009 
little more actually that allows us to
have<00:04:14.280> all<00:04:14.400> these<00:04:14.519> rocket<00:04:14.880> boots<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.630> really

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
have all these rocket boots is really

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.380 
have all these rocket boots is really
just<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.290> start<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.640> kind<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
just the start this this is kind of the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.530 
just the start this this is kind of the
are<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.769> support<00:04:20.220> beams<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.580> guess<00:04:20.820> for<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
are the support beams I guess for the

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.180 
are the support beams I guess for the
program<00:04:21.900> for<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.229> programs<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.800> come<00:04:22.979> it's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
program for the programs to come it's

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
program for the programs to come it's
going<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.370> be<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.520> structure<00:04:24.000> for<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
going to be the structure for the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.210 
going to be the structure for the
programming<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.380> going<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> be<00:04:25.919> carried

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
programming that is going to be carried

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.850 
programming that is going to be carried
out<00:04:26.310> over<00:04:26.580> than
