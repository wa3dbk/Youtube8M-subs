00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.320
 tutorial this is part 6 of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.080
 customize our windows 7 without 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.760
 put programs that have in the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 computer or that they do it very slowly that 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.340
 be very heavy 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.340
 now simply 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.470
 is to put a simple gadget we are going to 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.980
 open this link or uploaded by me already 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.460
 you know they have a problem with the link 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.310
 report on entering in if I solved of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.470
 fly 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:44.160
 good is relatively heavy nothing what 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.579
 we go down and bring this tablet 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.629
 but the saints 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.629
 we execute it 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.860
 we install the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.400
 I had it installed and we installed and 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.400
 here it is 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.110
 what is a big clock 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.530
 transparent by the numbers look at each other and 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 the letters 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.890
 It's very minimalist, I like it a lot and 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.250
 we can edit it we can put the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.250
 colour 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.890
 I do not like that color 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.240
 easy to 70 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.840
 we should put the tomato color 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.159
 he's fine 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.159
 I do not like it either 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.159
 a little more red that combines with the 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.159
 red east of the stew play 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.750
 let's see it's like this give a 60 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.820
 well then 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.499
 that's what you already edit it 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.429
 as you wish 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.429
 I like to put it like that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 so they want to put it like that if they want me 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.820
 put well here here where they want 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.820
 put you I like to put it like that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 it's very difficult at the time of here in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.620
 times and that would be all we have focus 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.020
 the icons we put the text 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.319
 Customized we change the icons 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.790
 we change the smell and that's all we've 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.459
 done this right now and now we add 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.760
 this gadget which same animal very 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.220
 minimalist and I really like the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.250
 true and it is very light it does not alter it 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.940
 nothing does not consume much or anything 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.400
 let's say performance 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.190
 the branch always does not consume one when 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.080
 I'm using and then there would be google 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.130
 chrome and computing time for use 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.010
 it comes out as you can see in google chrome and 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.270
 I'm eating something with the program 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
 what I am recording is consuming me 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.310
 something the truth does not not weigh the truth 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.840
 It is a very light gadget 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.500
