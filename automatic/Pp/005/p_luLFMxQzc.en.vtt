00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 of duty advanced warfare 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.580
 map with paolo delle poi we will go to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 see live a game I think he has 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 said in the middle of compound teams is one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.449
 training facility located at 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.150
 denver in colorado practically there 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.420
 really uses to go to train or 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.000
 better theater soldiers to go to 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.730
 training with your own duties is 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 in fact a structure to use at 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 maximum ex functions or then see 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.309
 a field of trento where there are gods 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.930
 vercelli blood and whatever else 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 we start to turn it has it for good for 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.030
 see a little how structured they are 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.219
 many and many bottlenecks e 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 very narrow and the passages below 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.989
 quite intrigued that lead us to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.059
 cut the map centrally for not 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.559
 move into action 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 obviously like we did for each 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.220
 dlc we're going to shoot all of them well 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.500
 four maps together ie from there 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.300
 we will go to whom I owe 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.860
 details and all information parts 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.410
 arrive then of course we will go to 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.660
 see live 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.610
 this delicate game sincerely me 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.890
 it looks very simple as a structure 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 only thing there are a lot of points 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.100
 wide there are quite simple life 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.220
 and to cover because there are passages 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.369
 dark light that can bring some 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.979
 sea ​​the human eye therefore in some 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:43.790
 breakers I think it 's hard while 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:49.030
 in others it seems to me very much I don't know if yes 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:56.000
 can even pass it can be passed again 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.770
 very simple structure however very much 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.160
 nice because I try a structure of 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.840
 colored training let me know 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.899

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.679

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.679
