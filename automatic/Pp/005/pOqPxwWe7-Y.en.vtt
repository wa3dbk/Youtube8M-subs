get the feeling like oh this is this is

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.349 
get the feeling like oh this is this is
trying<00:02:54.769> something<00:02:55.040> new<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.549> succeeding<00:02:56.180> it's

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
trying something new and succeeding it's

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.270

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
perhaps crashes biggest problem here is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.089 
perhaps crashes biggest problem here is
that<00:03:08.030> it's<00:03:08.300> not<00:03:08.450> as<00:03:08.599> good<00:03:08.780> as<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.560> older<00:03:09.860> crash

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099
