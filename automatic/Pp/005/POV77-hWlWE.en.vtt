voluminous I don't know if it's that way
everywhere

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
everywhere

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.939 
everywhere
but<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> bought<00:00:26.849> mine<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:28.230> mascara

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
but where I bought mine the mascara

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.300 
but where I bought mine the mascara
L'Oreal<00:00:29.820> voluminous<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:31.259> wrapped<00:00:31.650> in

L'Oreal voluminous was not wrapped in

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.060 
L'Oreal voluminous was not wrapped in
any<00:00:32.489> kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> packaging<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.470> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
any kind of packaging at all and so I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.520 
any kind of packaging at all and so I
think<00:00:35.520> somebody<00:00:35.970> might<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.360> tried<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
think somebody might have tried as a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
think somebody might have tried as a
tester<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.879> actually<00:00:39.059> bought

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
tester the one that I actually bought

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.990 
tester the one that I actually bought
and<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.859> an<00:00:40.980> eye<00:00:41.100> infection<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.820> it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
dual this month the reason why I'm doing
this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.780> interesting

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this is because I think it's interesting

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.109 
this is because I think it's interesting
as<00:01:10.860> we're<00:01:11.100> all<00:01:11.250> looking<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> good<00:01:11.729> mascara

as we're all looking for a good mascara
to<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.619> looks<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.670> reality

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to know what it looks like in reality

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
to know what it looks like in reality
not<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.540> from<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.079> recommendations<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
not just from the recommendations of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.230 
not just from the recommendations of
people<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.549> seeing<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> looks

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
people but actually seeing what it looks

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
people but actually seeing what it looks
like<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> eyes<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> other<00:01:20.040> reason<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
like on the eyes the other reason is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.830 
like on the eyes the other reason is
because<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.329> know<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because I don't know if you know this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
because I don't know if you know this
but<00:01:22.130> mascara<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.329> long

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
but mascara is not good for a very long

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.219 
but mascara is not good for a very long
time<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:26.869> perishable<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.020> all

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
time it's the most perishable of all

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.980 
time it's the most perishable of all
beauty<00:01:29.159> products<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.420> you're<00:01:30.600> only<00:01:30.780> supposed

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
beauty products and you're only supposed

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
beauty products and you're only supposed
to<00:01:31.200> use<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:31.950> month<00:01:32.159> after<00:01:32.790> you've

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
to use it for two month after you've

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.600 
to use it for two month after you've
opened<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.619> not<00:01:34.619> only<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.369> dry

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
opened it not only because it will dry

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.270 
opened it not only because it will dry
out<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.000> also<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:36.990> sum<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:38.040> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
out but also because it's a sum as you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.340 
out but also because it's a sum as you
can<00:01:38.430> tell<00:01:38.670> from<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.600> eye<00:01:39.630> infection<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.170> got

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
can tell from the eye infection I got

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.310 
can tell from the eye infection I got
it's<00:01:40.829> something<00:01:41.219> where<00:01:41.369> bacteria<00:01:42.149> will<00:01:42.570> will

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's something where bacteria will will

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's something where bacteria will will
you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.130> grow<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.180> shouldn't<00:01:45.509> keep

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you know grow and so you shouldn't keep

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.300 
you know grow and so you shouldn't keep
it<00:01:45.869> after<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.590> month<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.860> should<00:01:47.040> throw<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it after two month you should throw it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.580 
it after two month you should throw it
away<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.000> every<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> throw<00:01:49.439> away

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
away so every time I go to throw away

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.380 
away so every time I go to throw away
one<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> my<00:01:49.979> mascaras<00:01:50.399> I'll<00:01:50.640> actually

challenge it against another brand so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
challenge it against another brand so

lash queen extravaganza the brush as you

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.940 
lash queen extravaganza the brush as you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
can see is normal with the bristles not

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.400 
can see is normal with the bristles not
plastic<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:19.390> has<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:20.530> wavy<00:02:21.280> shape<00:02:21.790> where<00:02:22.600> there

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
plastic it has a wavy shape where there

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.130 
plastic it has a wavy shape where there
is<00:02:23.530> two<00:02:24.090> bigger<00:02:25.650> sizes<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:28.120> has<00:02:28.300> two<00:02:28.630> places

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
is two bigger sizes it has two places

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.280 
is two bigger sizes it has two places
where<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.440> bigger<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.850> there<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.840> in

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
where it's bigger here and there and in

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.960 
where it's bigger here and there and in
the<00:02:32.380> middle<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.830> sort<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.250> hollow<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:33.880> it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the middle it's sort of hollow so it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.180 
the middle it's sort of hollow so it
creates<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.510> wave<00:02:34.720> let's<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.740> on<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
creates a wave let's get on to the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.940 
creates a wave let's get on to the
actual<00:02:36.520> application<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:38.080> don't<00:02:38.530> worry<00:02:38.680> if<00:02:38.860> I

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
actual application so don't worry if I

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.190 
actual application so don't worry if I
if<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.820> put<00:02:40.090> some<00:02:40.240> mascara<00:02:40.540> everywhere<00:02:40.930> I'm<00:02:41.140> a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
if I put some mascara everywhere I'm a

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.640 
if I put some mascara everywhere I'm a
bit<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.590> klutz<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:42.100> anyway<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.570> one<00:02:43.750> is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
bit of a klutz but anyway so this one is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.150 
bit of a klutz but anyway so this one is
the<00:02:44.770> Ellen<00:02:45.370> R<00:02:45.490> Rubinstein<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:46.440> first<00:02:47.440> upon

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
the Ellen R Rubinstein one first upon

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.630 
the Ellen R Rubinstein one first upon
application<00:02:48.730> what<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.030> can<00:02:49.300> say<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
application what I can say is that the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.110 
application what I can say is that the
product<00:02:52.030> sort<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.830> doesn't<00:02:53.830> come<00:02:54.010> out<00:02:54.190> as

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
product sort of doesn't come out as

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.460 
product sort of doesn't come out as
easily<00:02:55.570> as<00:02:55.990> it<00:02:56.230> could<00:02:56.670> basically<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:58.240> very

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.940 

let's<00:03:02.470> say<00:03:02.590> dry<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.870> not<00:03:04.960> really<00:03:05.410> dry<00:03:05.710> but

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
let's say dry it's not really dry but

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.630 
let's say dry it's not really dry but
it's<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:07.600> sort<00:03:07.960> of<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:08.560> wants<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.340> stay<00:03:09.520> on

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
it's a it's sort of it wants to stay on

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.100 
it's a it's sort of it wants to stay on
the<00:03:09.760> brush<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.300> doesn't<00:03:10.570> want<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.750> come<00:03:10.810> on

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
the brush and it doesn't want to come on

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.190 
the brush and it doesn't want to come on
the<00:03:11.260> lash<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.850> once<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.630> lash<00:03:13.810> it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the lash but once it's on the lash it

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.080 
the lash but once it's on the lash it
creates<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:15.010> lengthening<00:03:15.520> effect

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
creates a lengthening effect

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.270 
creates a lengthening effect
I<00:03:16.630> don't<00:03:17.140> know<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.470> see<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:17.980> very

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
I don't know if you can see this very

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.630 
I don't know if you can see this very
well<00:03:18.489> but<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:20.320> has<00:03:20.620> it's<00:03:21.010> sort<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.370> cross

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
well but it it has it's sort of a cross

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.120 
well but it it has it's sort of a cross
between<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:24.630> L'Oreal<00:03:25.630> voluminous<00:03:25.810> or<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
between the L'Oreal voluminous or the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.910 
between the L'Oreal voluminous or the
YSL<00:03:27.760> Fasil<00:03:28.300> which<00:03:28.900> creates<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.380> long<00:03:30.209> lash<00:03:31.209> and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
YSL Fasil which creates a long lash and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.130 
YSL Fasil which creates a long lash and
between<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.540> mascara<00:03:34.540> which<00:03:34.750> would<00:03:34.959> create

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
between the mascara which would create

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.880 
between the mascara which would create
volume<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.690> nice<00:03:37.870> compromise<00:03:38.680> I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
volume and so it's a nice compromise I

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.620 
volume and so it's a nice compromise I
think<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:41.130> lengthen<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.310> also<00:03:42.940> will

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
think in that it lengthen and also will

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.560 
think in that it lengthen and also will
give<00:03:43.810> volume<00:03:44.080> after<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:45.390> second<00:03:46.390> or<00:03:46.540> third

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
give volume after the second or third

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.420 
give volume after the second or third
application<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:48.070> as<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.180> see<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:51.190> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
application so as you can see the the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.400 
application so as you can see the the
bristle<00:03:51.790> applies<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.330> product<00:03:52.750> pretty<00:03:53.140> well

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
bristle applies the product pretty well

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.580 
bristle applies the product pretty well
and<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:55.030> creates<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.980> long<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.450> thin<00:03:58.590> lashes

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
and it creates a long and thin lashes

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.850 
and it creates a long and thin lashes
that<00:04:00.190> are<00:04:00.820> well<00:04:01.239> separated<00:04:01.480> off<00:04:01.989> one<00:04:02.500> from<00:04:02.709> the

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
that are well separated off one from the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.240 
that are well separated off one from the
other<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:04.540> for<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.140> Eleanor<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.100> inch

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
other and that's for the Eleanor of inch

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.030 
other and that's for the Eleanor of inch
time<00:04:06.459> I'm<00:04:06.640> gonna<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.350> see<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.830> this

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
time I'm gonna so as you can see on this

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.820 
time I'm gonna so as you can see on this

your eyelashes and that's very practical

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.999 
your eyelashes and that's very practical
so<00:04:25.840> let's<00:04:26.020> apply<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.380> Lancome<00:04:26.979> Hypnose<00:04:27.340> drama

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
so let's apply the Lancome Hypnose drama

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.390 
so let's apply the Lancome Hypnose drama
all<00:04:30.009> right

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
all right

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.969 
all right
upon<00:04:30.669> application<00:04:31.110> what<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.139> can<00:04:32.410> say<00:04:32.740> as<00:04:32.949> the

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
upon application what I can say as the

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.520 
upon application what I can say as the
first<00:04:33.370> comment<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.660> application<00:04:35.470> is

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
first comment is that the application is

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.670 
first comment is that the application is
much<00:04:35.830> much<00:04:36.009> easier<00:04:36.389> it<00:04:37.389> sort<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.720> glides<00:04:37.960> onto

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
much much easier it sort of glides onto

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.159 
much much easier it sort of glides onto
the<00:04:39.430> lash<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.340> it's<00:04:42.340> much<00:04:42.639> easier<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:43.169> get

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
the lash and so it's much easier to get

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.680 
the lash and so it's much easier to get
all<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.800> lashes<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:45.849> start<00:04:46.330> from<00:04:46.539> the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
all the lashes and to start from the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.779 
all the lashes and to start from the
root<00:04:46.870> than<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:47.949> with<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.370> Illinois

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
root than it is with the Illinois

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.950 
root than it is with the Illinois
Rubinstein<00:04:50.430> also<00:04:51.430> another<00:04:52.000> comment<00:04:52.539> is<00:04:52.840> that

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
Rubinstein also another comment is that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.510 
Rubinstein also another comment is that
I<00:04:53.349> find<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:55.330> actually<00:04:56.220> gives<00:04:57.220> more

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
I find that it actually gives more

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.110 
I find that it actually gives more
volume<00:04:58.289> it's<00:04:59.289> sort<00:04:59.530> of<00:04:59.590> like<00:04:59.880> doesn't<00:05:00.880> create

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
volume it's sort of like doesn't create

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.540 
volume it's sort of like doesn't create
the<00:05:01.960> same<00:05:02.889> sort<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.370> lengthy<00:05:05.220> effect<00:05:06.220> with

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the same sort of lengthy effect with

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.670 
the same sort of lengthy effect with
each<00:05:06.880> lash<00:05:07.210> being<00:05:07.599> separated<00:05:08.139> from<00:05:08.440> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
each lash being separated from the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.330 
each lash being separated from the
others<00:05:08.979> but<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:10.060> does<00:05:10.330> create<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:11.080> more<00:05:11.620> intense

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
others but it does create a more intense

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.570 
others but it does create a more intense
black<00:05:13.800> effect<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.009> a<00:05:15.099> more<00:05:15.490> intense<00:05:16.530> volume

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
black effect and a more intense volume

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.510 
black effect and a more intense volume
so<00:05:18.580> basically<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.900> find<00:05:20.409> that<00:05:20.530> I've<00:05:20.800> at<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.370> end

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
so basically I find that I've at the end

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.480 
so basically I find that I've at the end
when<00:05:22.389> I've<00:05:22.509> applied<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.139> long<00:05:23.889> cozy<00:05:24.250> nose

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
when I've applied the long cozy nose

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.740 
when I've applied the long cozy nose
drama<00:05:24.849> my<00:05:25.690> lashes<00:05:25.960> feel<00:05:26.470> more<00:05:26.800> of<00:05:27.449> full<00:05:28.449> and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
drama my lashes feel more of full and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.219 
drama my lashes feel more of full and
more<00:05:29.740> black<00:05:29.979> than<00:05:30.669> they<00:05:31.389> do<00:05:31.780> with<00:05:32.020> the

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
more black than they do with the

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.520 
more black than they do with the
Illinois<00:05:32.530> Rubinstein<00:05:33.659> so<00:05:34.659> now<00:05:34.810> you<00:05:34.870> have<00:05:35.139> each
