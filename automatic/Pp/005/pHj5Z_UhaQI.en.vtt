00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.949 

all<00:00:01.860> right<00:00:02.100> well<00:00:02.490> had<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.790> few<00:00:03.000> people<00:00:03.300> that

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
all right well had a few people that

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.870 
all right well had a few people that
have<00:00:04.440> inquired<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.000> viaduct<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:08.849> I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
have inquired about the viaduct and so I

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.490 
have inquired about the viaduct and so I
thought<00:00:09.120> I'd<00:00:09.240> do<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> little<00:00:09.599> bit<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.200> video

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
thought I'd do a little bit of a video

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.160 
thought I'd do a little bit of a video
to<00:00:11.179> kind<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> show<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.420> what<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.750> looks<00:00:12.960> like

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
to kind of show you what it looks like

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.189 
to kind of show you what it looks like
up<00:00:13.500> close<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.370> then<00:00:14.639> some<00:00:15.330> people<00:00:15.780> had<00:00:16.020> some

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
up close and then some people had some

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.450 
up close and then some people had some
specific<00:00:16.710> questions<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
specific questions about the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.269 
specific questions about the
construction<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:19.050> we'll<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> quick<00:00:19.890> little

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
construction so we'll do a quick little

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.340 
construction so we'll do a quick little
overview<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:21.650> at<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.660> top<00:00:24.660> try<00:00:24.930> not<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> move

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
overview here at the top try not to move

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920 
overview here at the top try not to move
the<00:00:25.470> camera<00:00:25.680> too<00:00:25.980> quickly<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.820> it'll<00:00:27.660> stay<00:00:27.900> in

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the camera too quickly so it'll stay in

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.860 
the camera too quickly so it'll stay in
focus<00:00:32.630> just<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> sweeping<00:00:34.350> around<00:00:35.870> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
focus just kind of sweeping around and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.299 
focus just kind of sweeping around and
then<00:00:36.989> we'll<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:37.860> close-up

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
then we'll go in for some close-up

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:48.120 
then we'll go in for some close-up
pictures<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> minute

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.670 

there<00:00:48.760> we<00:00:48.970> go

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
there we go

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.650 
there we go
so<00:00:51.340> pretty<00:00:52.030> much<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.390> whole<00:00:52.540> viaduct<00:00:53.200> was<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
so pretty much the whole viaduct was the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.600 
so pretty much the whole viaduct was the
skeleton<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.230> viaduct<00:00:56.620> was<00:00:56.800> constructed<00:00:57.460> out

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
skeleton the viaduct was constructed out

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.490 
skeleton the viaduct was constructed out
of<00:00:57.750> wood<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:59.080> then<00:01:00.390> once<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.570> had<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.700> arcs<00:01:04.500> cut

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
of wood and then once I had the arcs cut

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.850 
of wood and then once I had the arcs cut
right<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.400> put<00:01:07.210> together<00:01:07.330> I<00:01:07.780> then<00:01:08.500> used

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
right and put together I then used

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.990 
right and put together I then used
someone<00:01:09.520> by<00:01:10.350> threes<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.950> make<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:15.580> hold<00:01:15.790> up

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
someone by threes to make the to hold up

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.100 
someone by threes to make the to hold up
the<00:01:16.150> structure<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.590> inside<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.220> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the structure and so inside of this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.240 
the structure and so inside of this
column<00:01:20.110> here<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.400> 1<00:01:21.760> by<00:01:21.910> 3<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:23.410> 1<00:01:24.040> by<00:01:24.220> 3

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
column here is a 1 by 3 and a 1 by 3

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.130 
column here is a 1 by 3 and a 1 by 3
here<00:01:25.000> going<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.550> here<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.900> in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
here going down and here and then in

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.460 
here going down and here and then in
this<00:01:29.560> column<00:01:29.979> as<00:01:30.160> well<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.750> with<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> facade

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
this column as well then with the facade

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.090 
this column as well then with the facade
of<00:01:33.000> birch<00:01:34.000> plywood<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:35.050> think<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.830> used

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
of birch plywood I think I used

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.780 
of birch plywood I think I used
quarter-inch<00:01:37.229> north<00:01:38.260> yeah<00:01:38.860> quarter-inch<00:01:39.490> on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
quarter-inch north yeah quarter-inch on

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.690 
quarter-inch north yeah quarter-inch on
the<00:01:39.940> outside<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.780> once<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:41.770> had<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.460> whole

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
the outside and once I had the whole

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.490 
the outside and once I had the whole
wooden<00:01:43.210> facade<00:01:43.500> created<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.020> covered<00:01:47.410> the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
wooden facade created then I covered the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
wooden facade created then I covered the
viaduct<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.970> plaster<00:01:49.900> actually<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.710> used<00:01:50.979> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
viaduct with plaster actually I used a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.730 
viaduct with plaster actually I used a
joint<00:01:52.270> compound<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:55.230> then<00:01:56.230> after<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.620> had

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
joint compound and then after I had

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.440 
joint compound and then after I had
applied<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.040> joint<00:01:57.490> compound<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.210> had<00:01:58.330> it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
applied the joint compound and had it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.930 
applied the joint compound and had it
fairly<00:01:59.110> even<00:01:59.800> coat<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:01.380> viaduct<00:02:02.940> wood

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
fairly even coat on the viaduct wood

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.230 
fairly even coat on the viaduct wood
superstructure<00:02:04.750> then<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.830> spent<00:02:06.790> pretty<00:02:07.120> much

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
superstructure then I spent pretty much

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.330 
superstructure then I spent pretty much
last<00:02:07.769> December<00:02:09.869> when<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.929> had<00:02:11.260> opportunities<00:02:12.040> I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
last December when I had opportunities I

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180 
last December when I had opportunities I
would<00:02:12.550> come<00:02:12.910> down<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.420> room<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.190> use

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
would come down to the room and use

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.560 
would come down to the room and use
dental<00:02:15.519> tools<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:17.010> etch<00:02:18.010> out<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.180> these

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
dental tools and etch out all of these

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.540 
dental tools and etch out all of these
individual<00:02:20.320> blocks<00:02:20.620> as<00:02:21.300> well<00:02:22.300> as<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.959> made<00:02:23.230> a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
individual blocks as well as I made a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.780 
individual blocks as well as I made a
made<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> tool<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.510> could<00:02:25.570> use<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:27.160> keep

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
made a tool that I could use to keep

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.560 
made a tool that I could use to keep
this<00:02:28.060> fairly<00:02:28.510> even<00:02:29.550> all<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.820> way<00:02:30.850> around<00:02:31.300> in

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
this fairly even all the way around in

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.320 
this fairly even all the way around in
the<00:02:31.660> arch<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.130> came<00:02:33.190> back<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.670> edged

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
the arch and then I came back and edged

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.050 
the arch and then I came back and edged
out<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.660> individual<00:02:35.560> blocks<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:39.060> section

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
out the individual blocks this section

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.190 
out the individual blocks this section
here<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:41.489> one<00:02:42.489> long<00:02:42.790> piece<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.600> material<00:02:43.810> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
here is one long piece of material that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.610 
here is one long piece of material that
I<00:02:44.880> fabricated<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.269> then<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.959> came<00:02:47.019> back<00:02:47.230> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
weathering the the bridge you know

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.690 
weathering the the bridge you know
you've<00:03:27.959> got<00:03:28.109> some<00:03:28.319> areas<00:03:28.530> that's<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.340> little

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
you've got some areas that's a little

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.050 
you've got some areas that's a little
bit<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:30.139> white<00:03:31.139> that's<00:03:31.530> been<00:03:31.769> added<00:03:31.980> as<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
bit of white that's been added as you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.149 
bit of white that's been added as you
know<00:03:33.150> these<00:03:33.389> things<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:34.200> mortar<00:03:34.590> leeches<00:03:35.040> out

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
know these things the mortar leeches out

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.449 
know these things the mortar leeches out
the<00:03:35.459> lime<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.269> sort<00:03:36.569> of<00:03:36.629> thing<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:36.870> just

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
the lime and that sort of thing so just

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:45.559 
the lime and that sort of thing so just
to<00:03:39.379> give<00:03:40.379> it<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.590> bit<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.859> color<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:43.669> I<00:03:44.669> guess

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
to give it a bit of color and I guess

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.399 
to give it a bit of color and I guess
that's<00:03:45.810> pretty<00:03:46.469> much<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:47.239> it's<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.419> you<00:03:49.290> know

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
that's pretty much it it's just you know

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.170 
that's pretty much it it's just you know
takes<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.709> little<00:03:49.859> time<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.159> carve<00:03:50.730> out<00:03:50.879> all<00:03:50.909> the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
takes a little time to carve out all the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.280 
takes a little time to carve out all the
little<00:03:51.329> stones<00:03:51.689> and<00:03:52.700> but<00:03:53.700> once<00:03:53.939> you<00:03:54.209> find<00:03:55.019> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
little stones and but once you find the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.470 
little stones and but once you find the
right<00:03:55.319> process<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.849> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:59.209> get<00:04:00.209> going

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
right process and you kind of get going

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.140 
right process and you kind of get going
it<00:04:01.260> moves<00:04:01.769> along<00:04:01.889> pretty<00:04:02.280> quickly<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:05.150> well

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
it moves along pretty quickly so well

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.199 
it moves along pretty quickly so well
that's<00:04:06.269> it<00:04:07.699> that's<00:04:08.699> helpful
