I<00:00:00.269> love<00:00:01.050> growing<00:00:01.290> plants<00:00:01.740> from<00:00:01.860> seed<00:00:02.190> it's<00:00:02.730> by

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
I love growing plants from seed it's by

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.030 
I love growing plants from seed it's by
far<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.570> best<00:00:03.750> way<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.929> fill<00:00:04.380> your<00:00:04.620> garden

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
far the best way to fill your garden

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.010 
far the best way to fill your garden
with<00:00:05.220> color<00:00:05.520> for<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.240> least<00:00:06.509> possible<00:00:06.720> amount

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
with color for the least possible amount

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.230 
with color for the least possible amount
of<00:00:07.379> money<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.919> actually<00:00:08.760> there's<00:00:08.940> nothing

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
of money and actually there's nothing

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
of money and actually there's nothing
more<00:00:09.420> exciting<00:00:09.840> than<00:00:10.110> collecting<00:00:10.710> your<00:00:10.830> own

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
more exciting than collecting your own

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.160 
more exciting than collecting your own
seed<00:00:11.340> from<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> garden<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.179> sowing<00:00:12.990> it

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
seed from the garden and sowing it

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.140 
seed from the garden and sowing it
yourself<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.950> growing<00:00:14.340> plants<00:00:14.849> from<00:00:14.969> your

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
yourself and growing plants from your

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.620 
yourself and growing plants from your
own<00:00:15.389> seed<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.029> some<00:00:18.330> people

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
own seed so I do know that some people

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.870 
own seed so I do know that some people
say<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.050> limited<00:00:19.770> success<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.550> seed

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
say they have limited success with seed

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.939 
say they have limited success with seed
so<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> wanted<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.470> show<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
so what I wanted to do is just show you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.980 
so what I wanted to do is just show you
how<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.189> grow<00:00:23.550> from<00:00:23.850> seed<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
how we grow from seed here at the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.679 
how we grow from seed here at the
nursery<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.060> hopefully<00:00:27.060> share<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> few<00:00:27.660> tips

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
nursery and hopefully share a few tips

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.689 
nursery and hopefully share a few tips
as<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.320> along

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
as we go along

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.979 
as we go along
so<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.599> compost<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.349> use<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.489> our

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
so the compost we use is just our

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.130 
so the compost we use is just our
nursery<00:00:33.989> peat<00:00:34.530> free<00:00:35.210> multi-purpose<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
nursery peat free multi-purpose but I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.799 
nursery peat free multi-purpose but I
sieve<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.980> bit<00:00:41.190> finer

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
sieve it to make it a little bit finer

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
sieve it to make it a little bit finer
and<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> take<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> larger<00:00:44.100> pieces<00:00:45.000> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and just to take the larger pieces of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.010 
and just to take the larger pieces of
art<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> bits<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.629> art<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
art out of it and the bits of art that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.430 
art out of it and the bits of art that
are<00:00:49.110> left<00:00:49.289> over<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.980> fine<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.960> mulching<00:00:51.960> pots

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
are left over are fine for mulching pots

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
are left over are fine for mulching pots
I<00:00:53.780> sew<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.230> seeds<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:56.030> half<00:00:57.030> size<00:00:57.360> seed

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I sew all our seeds into half size seed

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
I sew all our seeds into half size seed
trays<00:00:58.250> personally<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
trays personally it's just because I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
trays personally it's just because I
think<00:01:00.090> they're<00:01:00.390> easier<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> manage<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> know

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
think they're easier to manage you know

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.280 
think they're easier to manage you know
they<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:01.949> bend<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.290> damp

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
they don't bend if they get a bit damp

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.510 
they don't bend if they get a bit damp
and<00:01:05.330> from<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> point<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> view<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.920> taking<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and from a point of view of taking the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.190 
and from a point of view of taking the
seedlings<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> pot<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.659> pop<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.080> as

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
seedlings out to pot up pop them on as

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.539 
seedlings out to pot up pop them on as
well<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.070> seems<00:01:11.400> easier

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
well I don't know it just seems easier

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.590 
well I don't know it just seems easier
to<00:01:11.970> me<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.820> wouldn't<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.450> without

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
to me and this I wouldn't be without

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.940 
to me and this I wouldn't be without
it's<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.890> half<00:01:17.549> seed<00:01:18.420> tray<00:01:18.780> size<00:01:19.170> press<00:01:19.560> aboard

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it's a half seed tray size press aboard

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's a half seed tray size press aboard
it's<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:21.000> simple<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.840> made<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it's very simple it's just made out of I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.160 
it's very simple it's just made out of I
think<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:22.920> probably<00:01:23.189> 3/8<00:01:24.150> ply<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.600> something

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
think it's probably 3/8 ply or something

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.179 
think it's probably 3/8 ply or something
like<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.270> cut<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.509> fit<00:01:27.780> exactly<00:01:28.229> inside

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
like that and cut to fit exactly inside

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.260 
like that and cut to fit exactly inside
a<00:01:30.020> half<00:01:31.020> size<00:01:31.290> seed<00:01:31.560> tray<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.820> small

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a half size seed tray and then small

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
a half size seed tray and then small
wooden<00:01:33.540> handle<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.409> nailed<00:01:34.650> on

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
wooden handle and that's just nailed on

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.539 
wooden handle and that's just nailed on
with<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.100> small<00:01:35.369> nails<00:01:35.610> couldn't<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.240> simpler

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
with two small nails couldn't be simpler

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
with two small nails couldn't be simpler
and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.640> prefer<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> use<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> flat<00:01:40.020> bottom

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and I prefer I like to use a flat bottom

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.340 
and I prefer I like to use a flat bottom
plastic<00:01:41.189> scoop<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.909> well<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.420> scooping<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
plastic scoop as well for scooping the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.830 
plastic scoop as well for scooping the
compost<00:01:43.829> $2.99<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:44.939> something<00:01:45.240> from<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> garden

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
compost $2.99 or something from a garden

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.740 
compost $2.99 or something from a garden
center<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.710> essential<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> we've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.630> our

said compost now things remember about

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
said compost now things remember about
seeds<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.670> they've<00:01:53.790> only<00:01:53.909> got<00:01:54.119> one<00:01:54.299> shot<00:01:54.570> at

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
seeds is they've only got one shot at

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.200 
seeds is they've only got one shot at
life<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.250> want<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> sow

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
life so what you don't want to do is sow

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
life so what you don't want to do is sow
them<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.659> deeply<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.530> can't<00:01:58.860> make

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
lot of seeds won't germinate if they

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
lot of seeds won't germinate if they
can't<00:02:04.020> detect<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.979> light<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.820> that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
can't detect some light and know that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.210 
can't detect some light and know that
they're<00:02:06.149> close<00:02:06.420> enough<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> surface<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
they're close enough to the surface to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.850 
they're close enough to the surface to
survive

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
survive

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.620 
survive
so<00:02:10.390> we've<00:02:11.390> been<00:02:11.750> enjoying<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.270> make

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
so we've been enjoying that is to make

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.080 
so we've been enjoying that is to make

our seeds this one is a beautiful

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.869 
our seeds this one is a beautiful
aquilegia<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.860> spotted<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.430> our<00:03:24.549> stock

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
aquilegia that I spotted in our stock

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.420 
aquilegia that I spotted in our stock
beds<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.420> says<00:03:25.569> nice<00:03:25.780> flared<00:03:26.170> fall<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.340> we

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
beds and it says nice flared fall so we

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.880 
beds and it says nice flared fall so we
don't<00:03:27.640> know<00:03:27.879> it<00:03:28.750> won't<00:03:28.959> come<00:03:29.170> as<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.319> cultivar

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
don't know it won't come as a cultivar

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.589 
don't know it won't come as a cultivar
but<00:03:30.099> it<00:03:30.159> might<00:03:30.340> come<00:03:30.370> as<00:03:30.670> an<00:03:30.790> attractive<00:03:33.599> fully

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
but it might come as an attractive fully

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.780 
but it might come as an attractive fully
to<00:03:34.780> seeds<00:03:35.129> absolutely<00:03:36.129> beautiful<00:03:36.900> shiny<00:03:37.900> back

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
to seeds absolutely beautiful shiny back

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.360 
to seeds absolutely beautiful shiny back
so<00:03:39.790> just<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.989> scatter<00:03:41.470> them<00:03:41.769> thinly<00:03:42.129> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
so just going to scatter them thinly and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.920 
so just going to scatter them thinly and
evenly<00:03:42.489> on<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.239> surface<00:03:46.769> my<00:03:47.769> seed<00:03:48.370> tray<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.870> a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
evenly on the surface my seed tray on a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.430 
evenly on the surface my seed tray on a
tea<00:03:50.650> tray<00:03:50.950> at<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.430> stage<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.030> if<00:03:52.239> I<00:03:52.359> do

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
tea tray at this stage so that if I do

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.920 
tea tray at this stage so that if I do
spill<00:03:53.440> any<00:03:53.590> seed<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.970> won't<00:03:55.239> end<00:03:55.510> up<00:03:55.629> in<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
spill any seed it won't end up in the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.220 
spill any seed it won't end up in the
next<00:03:56.290> tray<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:59.760> topping<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.879> off<00:04:01.090> now<00:04:01.389> you

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
next tray so topping it off now you

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.740 
next tray so topping it off now you
could<00:04:02.440> use<00:04:02.470> compost<00:04:03.129> but<00:04:03.639> for<00:04:03.940> most<00:04:04.180> plants<00:04:04.629> I

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
could use compost but for most plants I

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.360 
could use compost but for most plants I
like<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.169> use<00:04:05.290> vermiculite<00:04:08.220> medium<00:04:09.220> for

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
like to use vermiculite medium for

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.020 
like to use vermiculite medium for
that's<00:04:09.519> light

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
that's light

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.710 
that's light
beautiful<00:04:11.960> that's<00:04:12.590> light<00:04:12.950> through<00:04:13.430> so<00:04:13.720> it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
beautiful that's light through so it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.890 
beautiful that's light through so it
means<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:15.489> your<00:04:16.489> seeds<00:04:16.880> won't<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.420> too<00:04:17.630> very

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
means that your seeds won't get too very

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.110 
means that your seeds won't get too very
into<00:04:18.260> dark<00:04:18.560> Mill<00:04:18.799> no<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.310> okay<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.640> germinate

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
into dark Mill no it's okay to germinate

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.750 
into dark Mill no it's okay to germinate
but<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.810> vermiculite<00:04:21.290> holds<00:04:22.070> moisture<00:04:22.220> so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
but the vermiculite holds moisture so

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.180 
but the vermiculite holds moisture so
it'll<00:04:22.910> keep<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.330> seed<00:04:23.600> moist<00:04:24.190> especially

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it'll keep the seed moist especially

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.280 
it'll keep the seed moist especially
during<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.640> critical<00:04:25.820> phase<00:04:26.120> while<00:04:27.110> it's

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
during that critical phase while it's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.130 
during that critical phase while it's
germinating<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:29.270> I'll<00:04:29.360> just<00:04:29.510> put<00:04:29.630> my<00:04:29.750> hands<00:04:30.020> on

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
germinating so I'll just put my hands on

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.730 
germinating so I'll just put my hands on
the<00:04:30.230> side<00:04:30.470> stop<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.550> spilling<00:04:31.850> over<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.650> want<00:04:33.650> to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
the side stop it spilling over I want to

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.180 
the side stop it spilling over I want to
waste<00:04:33.920> it<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.840> then<00:04:36.020> just<00:04:36.290> fell<00:04:36.920> in<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
waste it and then just fell in the

I've sown by keeping a log and giving
each<00:06:02.630> one<00:06:02.900> unique<00:06:03.320> numbers<00:06:03.860> so<00:06:04.100> we're<00:06:04.370> on<00:06:04.580> p4

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
each one unique numbers so we're on p4

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.450 
each one unique numbers so we're on p4
propagation<00:06:06.190> 174<00:06:07.390> 2013<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:09.160> so<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.250> first

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
propagation 174 2013 and so the first

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.510 
propagation 174 2013 and so the first
one<00:06:10.640> was<00:06:10.820> an<00:06:11.419> aquilegia<00:06:11.900> so<00:06:12.860> I<00:06:12.890> just<00:06:13.280> put<00:06:13.430> the

one was an aquilegia so I just put the

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.360 
one was an aquilegia so I just put the

batch number at the top and then write

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.920 
batch number at the top and then write
