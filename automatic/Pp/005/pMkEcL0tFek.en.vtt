00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.680 
these are Magnum scales so they're a bit
thicker<00:02:53.890> I'm<00:02:54.890> not<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.670> sure<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:56.510> will

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
thicker I'm not so sure this will

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.810 
thicker I'm not so sure this will
probably<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.290> be<00:02:57.410> sanded<00:02:58.070> I'm<00:02:58.370> gonna<00:02:58.550> try

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
probably have to be sanded I'm gonna try

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.199 
probably have to be sanded I'm gonna try
it<00:02:58.880> first<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.890> looks<00:03:01.100> really<00:03:01.400> cool<00:03:01.610> but<00:03:01.910> I'm

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
it first it looks really cool but I'm

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.500 
it first it looks really cool but I'm
thinking<00:03:03.160> realistically<00:03:04.160> for<00:03:04.190> use<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:05.330> will

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
thinking realistically for use this will

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.250 
thinking realistically for use this will
have<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:06.970> sanded<00:03:07.970> down<00:03:08.420> by<00:03:08.690> hand<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.230> make

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
have to be sanded down by hand to make

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.550 
have to be sanded down by hand to make
it<00:03:09.440> real<00:03:09.860> nice<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.220> smooth<00:03:10.519> so<00:03:11.200> no<00:03:12.200> hot<00:03:12.410> spots

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
it real nice and smooth so no hot spots

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.400 
it real nice and smooth so no hot spots
you<00:03:12.860> can<00:03:12.980> choke<00:03:13.220> up<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.640> right<00:03:13.970> here<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
you can choke up on it right here in the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.699 
you can choke up on it right here in the
choil<00:03:15.769> as<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.160> can<00:03:16.310> see<00:03:17.260> which<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.410> one<00:03:18.560> thing

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
choil as you can see which is one thing

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.620 
choil as you can see which is one thing
I<00:03:18.800> kind<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.130> wish<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.430> jungles<00:03:19.820> had<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.330> can't

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
I kind of wish the jungles had you can't

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.930 
I kind of wish the jungles had you can't
still<00:03:20.900> choke<00:03:21.110> up<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:21.830> it's<00:03:22.760> not<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
still choke up on it but it's not a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.640 
still choke up on it but it's not a
dedicated<00:03:23.480> trail<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.989> just<00:03:24.200> kind<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.440> put

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
dedicated trail you just kind of put

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.440 
dedicated trail you just kind of put
your<00:03:24.769> finger<00:03:25.040> right<00:03:25.220> there<00:03:25.519> which<00:03:26.120> works<00:03:28.450> this

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
your finger right there which works this

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.820 
your finger right there which works this
one<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.750> also<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:30.110> little<00:03:30.320> bit<00:03:30.410> different

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
one is also a little bit different

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.520 
one is also a little bit different
because<00:03:30.920> it's<00:03:31.280> got<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.660> saber<00:03:32.660> grind<00:03:32.930> instead

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
because it's got a saber grind instead

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.340 
because it's got a saber grind instead
of<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.739> full-height<00:03:34.130> convex<00:03:34.730> grind<00:03:35.350> which

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
of the full-height convex grind which

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.250 
of the full-height convex grind which
you<00:03:36.709> can<00:03:36.860> see<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.190> line<00:03:37.340> right<00:03:37.610> there

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.480 

which<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.730> know<00:03:43.110> routines<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:45.190> as<00:03:45.280> much

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
which you know routines really as much

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.360 
which you know routines really as much
weight<00:03:45.760> as<00:03:45.790> possible<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:50.440> again<00:03:50.590> at<00:03:50.980> point

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
weight as possible and again at point

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.090 
weight as possible and again at point
two<00:03:51.520> nine<00:03:51.700> inches<00:03:52.090> thick<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:53.500> we<00:03:53.650> compare<00:03:54.070> it

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
two nine inches thick if we compare it

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.790 
two nine inches thick if we compare it
to<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.630> moon<00:03:55.630> bus<00:03:58.380> which<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.560> three

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
to the moon bus which is three

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:07.160 
to the moon bus which is three
sixteenths<00:04:00.310> it's<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.760> substantial<00:04:01.510> difference

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.870 

which<00:04:08.170> results<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.710> a<00:04:08.770> lot<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.430> big<00:04:09.640> weight

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
which results in a lot and a big weight

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:18.900 
which results in a lot and a big weight
difference<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:18.100> battle<00:04:18.310> mistress<00:04:18.760> is

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
difference this the battle mistress is

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.630 
difference this the battle mistress is
too<00:04:19.090> heavy<00:04:19.330> for<00:04:19.390> my<00:04:19.660> scale<00:04:20.019> but<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:21.250> far<00:04:21.459> as<00:04:21.489> I

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
too heavy for my scale but as far as I

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.490 
too heavy for my scale but as far as I
know<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:21.880> should<00:04:22.090> be<00:04:22.210> around<00:04:22.720> 30<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.290> 33<00:04:24.010> ounces

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
know it should be around 30 to 33 ounces

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.790 
know it should be around 30 to 33 ounces
so<00:04:26.500> yeah<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:26.890> really<00:04:27.160> heavy<00:04:28.800> really

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
so yeah it's really heavy really

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.390 
so yeah it's really heavy really
well-constructed<00:04:34.860> really<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.160> cool

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
well-constructed really just a cool

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.390 
well-constructed really just a cool
knife<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.620> from<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.800> friend<00:04:39.010> on<00:04:39.280> the
