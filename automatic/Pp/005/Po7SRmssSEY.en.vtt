thank you and enjoy in this video I want
to<00:00:14.670> talk<00:00:14.790> about<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.150> activation<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.839> acetyl

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
to talk about the activation of acetyl

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.000 
to talk about the activation of acetyl
co<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> Melanie<00:00:17.039> Loco<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.650> basically<00:00:19.650> if

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
co a to Melanie Loco a so basically if

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859 
co a to Melanie Loco a so basically if
you<00:00:20.279> recall<00:00:20.609> from<00:00:20.789> beta-oxidation<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.660> had<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you recall from beta-oxidation we had to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
you recall from beta-oxidation we had to
activate<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.350> fatty<00:00:22.590> acid<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> CO<00:00:23.400> CO<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> which

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
activate a fatty acid to a CO CO a which

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
activate a fatty acid to a CO CO a which
is<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> activated<00:00:24.930> form<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> fatty<00:00:25.529> fatty

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
is the activated form of fatty fatty

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
is the activated form of fatty fatty
acid<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.939> could<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.390> undergo<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
acid that could actually undergo the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
acid that could actually undergo the
reactions<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> beta<00:00:28.500> oxidation<00:00:28.820> similar<00:00:29.820> idea

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
reactions of beta oxidation similar idea

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.880 
reactions of beta oxidation similar idea
here<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.420> fatty<00:00:30.599> acid<00:00:30.900> synthesis<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.769> have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
here with fatty acid synthesis we have

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.130 
here with fatty acid synthesis we have
to<00:00:31.980> activate<00:00:32.579> these<00:00:32.700> acetyl<00:00:33.090> co<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> z'<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to activate these acetyl co a z' to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.260 
to activate these acetyl co a z' to
their<00:00:34.290> active<00:00:34.649> form<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> Melanie<00:00:36.000> o<00:00:36.030> co

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
their active form which is Melanie o co

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
their active form which is Melanie o co
a<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> activated<00:00:38.460> form<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a so this is the activated form of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.430 
a so this is the activated form of
acetyl<00:00:39.090> co<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> molecule<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
acetyl co a and it's the molecule that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
acetyl co a and it's the molecule that
actually<00:00:40.770> undergoes<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> reactions<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
actually undergoes the reactions of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
actually undergoes the reactions of
fatty<00:00:42.600> acid<00:00:42.930> synthesis<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.370> start<00:00:44.550> off

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fatty acid synthesis so we start off

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
fatty acid synthesis so we start off
with<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.879> two<00:00:45.090> carbon<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.629> acetyl<00:00:46.200> co<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
with this two carbon a acetyl co a and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.729 
with this two carbon a acetyl co a and
we<00:00:47.340> attach<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.539> carboxyl<00:00:49.320> group<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.620> at

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we attach this carboxyl group here at

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
we attach this carboxyl group here at
the<00:00:49.800> bottom<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.539> carboxyl<00:00:51.539> group<00:00:51.690> comes

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the bottom and that carboxyl group comes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
the bottom and that carboxyl group comes
from<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.649> bicarbonate<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.860> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
from a bicarbonate and so because this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.490 
from a bicarbonate and so because this
is<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> carboxylation<00:00:56.850> reaction<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
is the carboxylation reaction it it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.029 
is the carboxylation reaction it it
requires<00:00:58.920> biotin<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.960> in<00:01:00.960> fact<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> name<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
requires biotin and in fact the name of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
requires biotin and in fact the name of
the<00:01:02.910> enzyme<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.420> catalyzes<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.960> reaction

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.880 
the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction
is<00:01:04.619> acetyl<00:01:05.100> co<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.630> carboxylase<00:01:06.799> because<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
is acetyl co a carboxylase because of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
is acetyl co a carboxylase because of
course<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.310> said<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> carboxylation

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
course like I said it's a carboxylation

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.090 
course like I said it's a carboxylation
reaction<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.500> why<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.650> requires<00:01:10.770> by

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
reaction and that's why it requires by

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.149 
reaction and that's why it requires by
biotin<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:13.070> adding<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> carbon<00:01:14.520> carbon

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
biotin and adding a carbon carbon

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.649 
biotin and adding a carbon carbon
dioxide<00:01:17.159> group<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.549> essentially<00:01:18.119> uh<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
dioxide group or essentially uh by the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.109 
dioxide group or essentially uh by the
bicarbonate<00:01:19.320> requires<00:01:19.920> energy<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
bicarbonate requires energy and this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
bicarbonate requires energy and this
makes<00:01:21.360> sense<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.720> given<00:01:23.210> given<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:25.380> we're

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
makes sense to given given that if we're

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
makes sense to given given that if we're
having<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.369> we're<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.110> getting

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
having if we're kind of getting

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
having if we're kind of getting
ourselves<00:01:28.229> ready<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.829> fatty<00:01:29.189> acid<00:01:29.520> synthesis

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
ourselves ready for fatty acid synthesis

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
ourselves ready for fatty acid synthesis
it<00:01:30.390> makes<00:01:30.600> sense<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.250> investing

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it makes sense that we're in investing

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.149 
it makes sense that we're in investing
ATP<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:33.079> we're<00:01:34.079> storing<00:01:34.470> energy<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
ATP because we're storing energy so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.859 
ATP because we're storing energy so
there<00:01:35.310> energy<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> available<00:01:37.130> okay<00:01:38.130> cool<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
there energy is available okay cool so

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
there energy is available okay cool so
this<00:01:39.869> Melanie<00:01:40.409> Ocoee<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.670> molecule<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
this Melanie Ocoee is the molecule that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
this Melanie Ocoee is the molecule that
is<00:01:42.329> committed<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> fatty<00:01:43.530> acid<00:01:43.950> synthesis<00:01:44.430> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is committed to fatty acid synthesis so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.990 
is committed to fatty acid synthesis so
since<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.930> committed<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.159> step<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
since it's committed this step here is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.690 
since it's committed this step here is
the<00:01:48.210> first<00:01:48.479> committed<00:01:49.380> set<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:52.369> fatty<00:01:53.369> acid

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the first committed set of fatty acid

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389 
the first committed set of fatty acid
synthesis<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> key

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
synthesis and because of that is a key

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
synthesis and because of that is a key
regulatory<00:01:57.000> enzyme<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.600> fatty<00:01:57.840> acids<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
regulatory enzyme in fatty acids so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.819 
regulatory enzyme in fatty acids so
we'll<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.399> later<00:01:59.610> now

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
we'll see more about that later now

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
we'll see more about that later now
Melanie<00:02:01.829> Ocoee<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.360> main

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
Melanie Ocoee is going to be the main

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.539 
Melanie Ocoee is going to be the main
two<00:02:03.899> carbon<00:02:04.259> donor<00:02:04.439> fatty<00:02:04.860> acid<00:02:05.189> synthesis

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
two carbon donor fatty acid synthesis

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.029 
two carbon donor fatty acid synthesis
and<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> mean<00:02:06.119> by<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.039> earlier

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and what I mean by that is that earlier

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
and what I mean by that is that earlier
we<00:02:08.220> mentioned<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:09.479> we're<00:02:09.629> building<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
we mentioned that when we're building a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
we mentioned that when we're building a
fatty<00:02:10.259> acid<00:02:10.679> we're<00:02:10.860> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.099> continually

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
fatty acid we're going to continually

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.089 
fatty acid we're going to continually
add<00:02:11.700> two<00:02:11.940> carbon<00:02:12.330> units<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> time

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
add two carbon units at a time

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.860 
add two carbon units at a time
the<00:02:14.760> molecule<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.209> gonna<00:02:15.329> be<00:02:15.420> donating

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the molecule that's gonna be donating

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
the molecule that's gonna be donating
those<00:02:15.959> two<00:02:16.140> carbons<00:02:16.379> at<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.799> is<00:02:16.980> Melanie

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
those two carbons at a time is Melanie

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.910 
those two carbons at a time is Melanie
okay<00:02:17.599> it's<00:02:18.599> kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.840> weird<00:02:19.079> though<00:02:19.170> right

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
okay it's kind of weird though right

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.369 
okay it's kind of weird though right
because<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.329> free<00:02:21.659> carbon<00:02:21.989> molecule

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
because this is a free carbon molecule

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.020 
because this is a free carbon molecule
while<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.769> three<00:02:23.069> carbon<00:02:23.310> molecule<00:02:23.819> be<00:02:23.909> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
while the three carbon molecule be the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.880 
while the three carbon molecule be the
two<00:02:24.150> carbon<00:02:24.510> donor<00:02:24.689> and<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.500> reason<00:02:25.709> why<00:02:25.829> is

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
two carbon donor and the reason why is

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.979 
two carbon donor and the reason why is
that<00:02:26.129> first<00:02:26.430> step<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.819> first<00:02:27.450> reaction<00:02:27.959> that

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
that first step that first reaction that

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.830 
that first step that first reaction that
condensation<00:02:28.739> reaction<00:02:29.250> actually<00:02:29.840> releases

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
condensation reaction actually releases

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.440 
condensation reaction actually releases
this<00:02:31.109> carbon<00:02:31.500> dioxide<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.609> this<00:02:32.879> third<00:02:33.120> carbon

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
this carbon dioxide so this third carbon

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.149 
this carbon dioxide so this third carbon
is<00:02:33.780> irrelevant

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
is irrelevant

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.670 
is irrelevant
in<00:02:35.459> terms<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.810> product<00:02:37.140> that's<00:02:37.260> yielded

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
in terms of the product that's yielded

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.220 
in terms of the product that's yielded
so<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.209> Melanie<00:02:39.510> way<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.900> going<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.079> be<00:02:40.139> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
so the Melanie way is going to be the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.720 
so the Melanie way is going to be the
main<00:02:40.500> two<00:02:40.709> carbon<00:02:41.040> donor<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> reason<00:02:41.639> why

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
main two carbon donor and the reason why

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.610 
main two carbon donor and the reason why
I<00:02:41.760> say<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> main<00:02:42.510> two<00:02:42.840> carbon<00:02:43.170> donor<00:02:43.349> is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
I say the main two carbon donor is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.979 
I say the main two carbon donor is
because<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.219> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.579> contribute<00:02:44.989> almost

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
because it's going to contribute almost

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.199 
because it's going to contribute almost
all<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.709> carbons<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.609> palmitate<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
all the carbons to the palmitate that

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.330 
all the carbons to the palmitate that
we're<00:02:48.299> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.599> be<00:02:48.659> making<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.889> 16

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
we're going to be making so of the 16

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.119 
we're going to be making so of the 16
carbons<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.819> palmitate<00:02:51.349> 14<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.500> those<00:02:52.620> carbons

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
carbons in palmitate 14 of those carbons

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.640 
carbons in palmitate 14 of those carbons
are<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:53.669> Melanie<00:02:54.030> Ocoee<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:55.260> other<00:02:55.439> two

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
are from Melanie Ocoee the other two

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.220 
are from Melanie Ocoee the other two
carbons<00:02:56.129> are<00:02:56.579> from<00:02:57.030> acetyl<00:02:57.329> co<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.870> that's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
carbons are from acetyl co a and that's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.349 
carbons are from acetyl co a and that's
because<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.829> first<00:02:59.189> reaction<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.150> first

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
because the first reaction the first

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.679 
because the first reaction the first
condensation<00:03:01.079> reaction<00:03:02.120> brings<00:03:03.120> an<00:03:03.329> acetyl

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
condensation reaction brings an acetyl

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.710 
condensation reaction brings an acetyl
co<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> Melanie<00:03:04.650> Ocoee<00:03:04.889> together<00:03:05.720> after

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
co a and a Melanie Ocoee together after

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.809 
co a and a Melanie Ocoee together after
that<00:03:06.750> every<00:03:07.530> single<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.950> carbon<00:03:08.310> donor<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.760> a

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
that every single to carbon donor is a

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.390 
that every single to carbon donor is a
melon<00:03:09.269> Yoko<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.739> hope<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.010> video<00:03:11.099> was

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
melon Yoko a so I hope that video was

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.510 
melon Yoko a so I hope that video was
