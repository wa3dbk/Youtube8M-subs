00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
passing plays that that really worked

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.069 
passing plays that that really worked
well<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.480> stop<00:00:48.780> I

noticed<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.860> man<00:00:50.160> coverage<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.820> kind<00:00:51.059> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
noticed that man coverage was kind of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290 
noticed that man coverage was kind of
like<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> bane<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:52.520> almost<00:00:53.520> everything<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
like the bane of almost everything that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
like the bane of almost everything that
she<00:00:54.600> threw<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.649> noticing<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.190> as

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
she threw it but I'm noticing here as

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.680 
she threw it but I'm noticing here as
well<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.820> always<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> correct

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
well that it's not always the correct

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
well that it's not always the correct
answer<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.530> depends<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.070> your

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

your opponent's doing so let's say for

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.389 
your opponent's doing so let's say for
example<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:46.409> come<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
example they if they come out in I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.310
