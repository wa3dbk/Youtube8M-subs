stir<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.930> like<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.669> combustor

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
stir it like this in the combustor

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.920 
stir it like this in the combustor
pushing<00:04:25.400> it<00:04:25.490> all<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:26.150> way<00:04:26.270> down<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:29.660> next

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
pushing it all the way down the next

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.170 
pushing it all the way down the next
thing<00:04:29.990> you'll<00:04:30.229> do<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:31.070> install<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.820> spark

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
thing you'll do is install the spark

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:51.340 
thing you'll do is install the spark
plug

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.520 

we<00:04:52.350> have<00:04:52.820> two<00:04:54.710> four<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.040> six<00:04:56.690> foot<00:04:57.690> extensions

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
we have two four and six foot extensions

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.750 
we have two four and six foot extensions
available<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.900> this<00:05:01.460> demonstration<00:05:02.460> we're

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
available in this demonstration we're

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.950 
available in this demonstration we're
going<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.910> be<00:05:03.060> using<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.480> 2<00:05:03.690> foot<00:05:03.930> extension

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
going to be using the 2 foot extension

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.210 
going to be using the 2 foot extension
simply<00:05:06.960> take<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.350> combustor<00:05:09.950> snap<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.130> in

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
simply take the combustor snap it in

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.510 
simply take the combustor snap it in
place<00:05:13.580> take<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.760> heat<00:05:14.970> tool<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:16.490> snap<00:05:17.490> that

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
place take the heat tool and snap that

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:31.490 
place take the heat tool and snap that
in<00:05:17.880> place<00:05:21.350> now<00:05:22.350> turn<00:05:22.650> on<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.800> fuel<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:29.100> shrink
