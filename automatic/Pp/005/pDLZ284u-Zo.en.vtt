00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.130
 little clarity on the rock which is a 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:19.080
 little more saw the light not this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 saw lights and if the hustler 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.930
 light comes to die on the far right 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.200
 receipts like here on the far left 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 now the form the shape of the water 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:46.110
 around lauquet splash a little 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:50.340
 little here in the wave that was just 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:00.590
 before a commensal form so happy in 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:00.590
 the sand here also the same principle here 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.370
 splash a little 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.550
 a little splash of our 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:19.630
 waves to each other so here we type him 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.630
 with a little natural sienna 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.170
 we can note redon bollÃ©e 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.450
 etna let's go with the other end to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 the other end of the blah 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:07.620
 the wave at the other end a little bit of 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.620
 stringent lawseau 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.319
 only on the tip of the brush none 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.319
 pressure here 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:45.110
 now we have birds to each other 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.690
 just a lot of time 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.610
 you know we were in rowboat and everything 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.709
 of a sudden and start making sound 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.310
 start to raise a little bit the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.819
 wind has risen 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.069
 so we came to run aground with the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.870
 boat bench as they came 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.620
 to run aground with a cottage or is it 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.280
 could be ready to bring him here just to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.700
 down we put a little bit inside 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.620
 from the cave to point arms to the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 afraid of sourness maybe in sum I 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.140
 thought the night here and sir rest 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.140
 the night in the cave 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.170
 but here to be certain not to 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 lose the rowboat 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.220
 the very ugly ghana too far we're going 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.620
 to run aground is to spend the night at 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.270
 the pure state recently not too much we lose in 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.340
 stay in the boat purely three 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.340
 years with with the sea
