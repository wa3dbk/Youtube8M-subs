00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.500
 just decided to do it six months ago 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.210
 it's great it explodes my way 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 to explain things to people who 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230

 I'm starting to really catch up in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 French and I did not elaborate too much on 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.789
 all the videos I made for 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 keep things simple now the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.109
 the more I speak French of course the more 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 I will try to elaborate more on 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.699
 topics are 10 videos that I have 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.640

 remake and well crafted keeping them 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.510
 simple things because as I the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010

 if there is a utility 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 should they be taken before taking after 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.439
 not because we can read a lot of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.619

 find at optimum sport you do not get 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.580
 shit a goat city built in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.050
 the 90s if you are great book he 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.910
 focused more on the hammer 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.910
 dextrin is a little bit of 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.700
 dextrose data and fructose but 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.290
 most wisteria come from mato 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.170
 dextrin because he had viz had done 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.730
 a lot of Russian search and you 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.280
 can check this on the book 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.420
 unstable I love a hard at these 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.330
 last time I made a video 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.950
 I was using the ex textron after 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.760
 training for recovery 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.340
 fast and also during training 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.680
 sometimes I use dextrose 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.300
 maltodextrin from corrugated 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.100
 snacks I was making acids 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.930
 amines plugged in glutamine is everything 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.360
 little bit of creatine something 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.580
 simple so you can quote me must I 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.320
 take the d2 of the dextrine match with a 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.000
 very little dextrose and 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.200
 fructose you do about 80 75 and the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.880
 rest half 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.040
 that's the best thing to do 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.050
 during training and after 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.600
 training so the thing too 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 the call to the super deal also when 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.750
 I made my collection briois card 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.310
 before workouts what am I 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.070
 do and what if we did all the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.160
 pros and we had started to discovered 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.080
 discover that I believe in the midst of 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.840
 90s 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.940
 when you take a snack take it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.880
 dextrine mato as I do you 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.640
 explain and add acids 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.360
 amines connected with glutamine and 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.910
 creatine and vitamin c powder 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.400
 take for example if 100% of the 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.590
 snack you go to sell but avola 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 cola before training you will learn 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.690
 50% of the snack and during a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.600
 drive you continue to see everything 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.250
 slowly 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.190
 the breed of snack of course has to 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.640
 take water it works is great 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.430
