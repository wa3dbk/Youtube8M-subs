boats or planes so let's just take a
look<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.660> monster<00:00:30.900> truck<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.529> we're

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
look at this monster truck what we're

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
look at this monster truck what we're
gonna<00:00:31.800> basically<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.730> monster

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
gonna basically do with this monster

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
gonna basically do with this monster
truck<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.870> taken<00:00:34.200> after<00:00:34.350> run<00:00:34.710> solution

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
truck it's taken after run solution

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
truck it's taken after run solution
because<00:00:35.910> some<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> nitrous<00:00:36.660> Rios<00:00:36.989> use<00:00:37.260> out

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
because some of the nitrous Rios use out

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
because some of the nitrous Rios use out
there<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.399> nitro<00:00:38.969> solution<00:00:39.540> like

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there don't have a nitro solution like

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470 
there don't have a nitro solution like
an<00:00:39.930> after<00:00:40.260> run<00:00:40.440> base<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
an after run base in it so what this is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.389 
an after run base in it so what this is
going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> prevent<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> alcohol

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
going to prevent is that the alcohol

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000 
going to prevent is that the alcohol
it's<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> nitro<00:00:45.329> fuel<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.320> evaporates

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it's in the nitro fuel if it evaporates

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's in the nitro fuel if it evaporates
over<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.399> course<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> couple<00:00:48.090> weeks<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
over the course of a couple weeks so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
over the course of a couple weeks so
over<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> winter<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.520> your

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
over the winter then you have your

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880 
over the winter then you have your
carburetor<00:00:51.390> gummed<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> excess

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
carburetor gummed up with all the excess

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.910 
carburetor gummed up with all the excess
oil<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
oil so this will kind of make it a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.029 
oil so this will kind of make it a
little<00:00:56.010> less<00:00:56.489> gummed<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> we'll<00:00:58.710> try<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
little less gummed up and we'll try and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.740 
little less gummed up and we'll try and
flush<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> excess<00:01:00.120> fuel<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.660> there

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
flush all the excess fuel out of there

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680 
flush all the excess fuel out of there
before<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.340> we're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.359> take

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
before so what we're gonna do is take

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.820 
before so what we're gonna do is take
our<00:01:03.840> fuel<00:01:04.080> lines<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:04.790> blow<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:06.000> out

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
our fuel lines right here blow them out

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.950 
our fuel lines right here blow them out
back<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> fuel<00:01:08.490> tank<00:01:08.540> okay<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
back into the fuel tank okay so the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
back into the fuel tank okay so the
lines<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.350> nice<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> clear<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.760> don't

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
lines are nice and clear and we don't

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
lines are nice and clear and we don't
have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.270> necessarily<00:01:12.420> replace<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.470> lines

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
have to necessarily replace the lines

out<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.159> inside<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> piston<00:01:48.090> cylinder<00:01:48.540> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
out and inside the piston cylinder I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.710 
out and inside the piston cylinder I
flushed<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.680> out<00:01:50.149> now<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.390> we'll<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.690> is

we'll grab the Opteron solution put a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
we'll grab the Opteron solution put a
couple<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.440> drops<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.250> squirt<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
couple of drops in there and squirt that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.290 
couple of drops in there and squirt that
in<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:58.130> either<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.550> electric<00:01:59.970> start

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
in there either with your electric start

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
in there either with your electric start
your<00:02:00.509> pull<00:02:00.720> start<00:02:01.250> remote<00:02:02.250> start<00:02:02.610> some

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
your pull start remote start some

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.370 
your pull start remote start some
possibilities<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:05.280> crank<00:02:05.550> over<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.880> motor

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.020 

let<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.560> feed<00:02:10.830> through<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.190> carburetor<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
let it feed through the carburetor and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.630 
let it feed through the carburetor and
up<00:02:12.150> into<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> piston<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.080> cylinder<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:14.459> that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
up into the piston and cylinder so that

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.699 
up into the piston and cylinder so that
it<00:02:14.820> basically<00:02:15.239> coats<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.840> engine<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
it basically coats the engine with the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.009 
it basically coats the engine with the
after<00:02:17.160> run<00:02:17.310> solution<00:02:17.910> once<00:02:18.690> you're<00:02:18.870> done

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
after run solution once you're done

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.590 
after run solution once you're done
doing<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:20.310> basically<00:02:20.550> put<00:02:21.090> your<00:02:21.269> filter

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
doing that you basically put your filter

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.449 
doing that you basically put your filter
on<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.200> no<00:02:22.350> debris<00:02:22.680> gets<00:02:23.040> into<00:02:23.340> your

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
on so no debris gets into your

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.670 
on so no debris gets into your
carburetor<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.840> course<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.290> time<00:02:25.500> that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
carburetor for the course of time that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.070 
carburetor for the course of time that
it's<00:02:25.800> being<00:02:26.069> stored<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> basically<00:02:27.510> put

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it's being stored then you basically put

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's being stored then you basically put
either<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.440> cloth<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.190> nice<00:02:29.459> clean<00:02:29.870> cloth<00:02:30.870> into

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
either a cloth a nice clean cloth into
