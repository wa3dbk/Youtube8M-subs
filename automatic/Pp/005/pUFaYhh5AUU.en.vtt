from<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.600> sketch<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.350> am<00:00:54.499> taking<00:00:54.979> a

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
from a sketch I am taking a

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.979 
from a sketch I am taking a
two-dimensional<00:00:55.850> idea<00:00:56.239> into<00:00:56.749> three

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
two-dimensional idea into three

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.219 
two-dimensional idea into three
dimensions<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:58.159> will<00:00:58.370> make<00:00:58.549> this<00:00:59.019> then<00:01:00.019> the

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
dimensions so I will make this then the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.439 
dimensions so I will make this then the
block<00:01:00.440> maker<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.889> little<00:01:01.159> car<00:01:01.429> exactly<00:01:02.089> what<00:01:02.420> I

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
block maker a little car exactly what I

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
block maker a little car exactly what I
gave<00:01:02.749> him

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 

we<00:01:05.850> chose<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> draw<00:01:06.750> shapes<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.800> proportions

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
we chose to draw shapes and proportions

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.780 
we chose to draw shapes and proportions
and<00:01:08.880> by<00:01:09.770> everything<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> surrounds<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and by everything that surrounds of the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.760 
and by everything that surrounds of the
shape<00:01:12.120> so<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.890> possibilities<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.010> endless

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
shape so the possibilities are endless

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
shape so the possibilities are endless
this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> Austria<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> where<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.910> break

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is Austria this is where we break

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.499 
this is Austria this is where we break
everything

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
everything

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.050 
everything
make<00:01:20.020> everything<00:01:20.259> on<00:01:20.590> hand<00:01:20.799> it's<00:01:21.789> all

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
make everything on hand it's all

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.779 
make everything on hand it's all
handwork<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.140> there<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.439> no<00:01:23.680> machinery<00:01:24.070> that's

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
handwork so there is no machinery that's

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.660 
handwork so there is no machinery that's
are<00:01:25.570> an<00:01:26.530> illusion<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.189> know<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:27.549> supposed

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
are an illusion you know it's supposed

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.090 
are an illusion you know it's supposed
to<00:01:27.850> look<00:01:28.030> effortless<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.719> easy<00:01:28.840> but<00:01:29.409> in<00:01:29.799> fact

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
to look effortless and easy but in fact

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.880 
to look effortless and easy but in fact
it's<00:01:30.520> not<00:01:30.700> simple<00:01:31.149> it's<00:01:31.240> about<00:01:31.299> its<00:01:32.049> racing

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
it's not simple it's about its racing

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.910 
it's not simple it's about its racing
seasons<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.460> so<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.969> is<00:01:34.149> our<00:01:34.329> big<00:01:34.920> hat

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
seasons and so this is our big hat

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.120 
seasons and so this is our big hat
moment<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.970> year<00:01:37.179> when<00:01:37.509> everyone<00:01:38.130> decides

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
moment of the year when everyone decides

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.160 
moment of the year when everyone decides
what<00:01:39.399> they<00:01:39.520> wear<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> races<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.840> kind<00:01:41.079> of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
what they wear to the races you kind of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.109 
what they wear to the races you kind of
match<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.500> hat<00:01:42.009> with<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.399> personality<00:01:43.090> of

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
match the hat with the personality of

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.880 
match the hat with the personality of
the<00:01:43.329> person<00:01:43.509> everybody<00:01:44.110> likes<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.619> idea<00:01:44.649> of

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the person everybody likes the idea of

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.830 
the person everybody likes the idea of
having<00:01:45.069> something<00:01:45.399> special<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:46.509> for<00:01:46.600> them

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
having something special just for them

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.020 
having something special just for them
but<00:01:47.140> with<00:01:47.920> models<00:01:48.280> it's<00:01:48.490> slightly<00:01:48.729> different

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
but with models it's slightly different

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.789 
but with models it's slightly different
because<00:01:49.329> models<00:01:49.810> make<00:01:50.170> everything<00:01:50.439> look<00:01:50.740> good

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
because models make everything look good

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.949 
because models make everything look good
you<00:01:51.340> know<00:01:51.369> Jodie<00:01:51.759> has<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.970> very<00:01:52.299> sculptural

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
you know Jodie has a very sculptural

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.719 
you know Jodie has a very sculptural
face<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:55.409> lends<00:01:56.409> itself<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.039> my<00:01:57.459> hats

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
face so it lends itself to that my hats

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.039 
face so it lends itself to that my hats
are<00:01:57.849> not<00:01:57.880> necessarily<00:01:58.539> known<00:01:58.689> for<00:01:58.899> their

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
are not necessarily known for their

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.889 
are not necessarily known for their
subtlety<00:01:59.530> but<00:01:59.819> yeah<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:00.849> can't<00:02:01.479> make<00:02:01.630> very

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
subtlety but yeah I can't make very

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.039 
subtlety but yeah I can't make very
subtle<00:02:02.229> has<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:03.209> but<00:02:04.209> every<00:02:04.509> one<00:02:04.899> is

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
subtle has to but every one is

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.800 
subtle has to but every one is
completely<00:02:05.459> different<00:02:06.459> but<00:02:07.149> we<00:02:07.329> have<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.689> be

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
completely different but we have to be

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.350 
completely different but we have to be
inventive<00:02:08.500> fashion<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.220> about<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.910> it's

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
inventive fashion is about you it's

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.030 
inventive fashion is about you it's
about<00:02:10.390> people<00:02:11.019> want<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.290> see<00:02:11.410> something<00:02:12.010> that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
about people want to see something that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.220 
about people want to see something that
they've<00:02:12.370> never<00:02:12.549> seen<00:02:13.000> before<00:02:13.269> bar<00:02:13.930> has<00:02:14.049> never

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
they've never seen before bar has never

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.870 
they've never seen before bar has never
been<00:02:14.410> invented<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.190> that's<00:02:15.370> what<00:02:15.519> makes<00:02:15.730> you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
been invented and that's what makes you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.600 
been invented and that's what makes you
continue<00:02:16.360> really<00:02:16.660> because<00:02:16.989> you're<00:02:17.170> always

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
continue really because you're always
