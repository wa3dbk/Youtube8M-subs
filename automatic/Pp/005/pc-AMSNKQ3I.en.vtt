00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
little brother with 11.6 inch screen and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.069 
little brother with 11.6 inch screen and
there's<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.329> be<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.420> big<00:02:47.660> brother<00:02:47.840> with<00:02:48.049> a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
there's going to be a big brother with a

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.860 
there's going to be a big brother with a
13.3<00:02:48.709> inch<00:02:48.980> screen<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.299> knowable<00:02:50.750> that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
13.3 inch screen and it is knowable that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
13.3 inch screen and it is knowable that
both<00:02:51.530> screens<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.069> very<00:02:52.430> high<00:02:52.519> resolution

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
both screens have very high resolution

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.360 
both screens have very high resolution
indeed<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.780> 13.3<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.590> actually<00:02:54.890> more

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
indeed and the 13.3 is actually more

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.099 
indeed and the 13.3 is actually more
resolution<00:02:55.910> than<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> macbook<00:02:56.510> pro<00:02:56.540> series

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
resolution than the macbook pro series

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.559 
resolution than the macbook pro series
so<00:02:57.319> that's<00:02:57.470> very<00:02:57.590> very<00:02:58.100> cool<00:02:58.310> indeed<00:02:58.569> don't

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
so that's very very cool indeed don't

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.030 
so that's very very cool indeed don't
during<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.900> bottom<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.500> some<00:03:00.650> features

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
during the bottom is just some features

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.620 
during the bottom is just some features
that<00:03:01.069> they<00:03:01.459> showed<00:03:01.850> with<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.389> it's<00:03:02.420> got<00:03:02.600> a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
that they showed with it so it's got a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.080 
that they showed with it so it's got a
core<00:03:02.900> 2<00:03:03.079> duo<00:03:03.109> processor<00:03:03.519> it's<00:03:04.519> gotten<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> video

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
core 2 duo processor it's gotten a video

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.420 
core 2 duo processor it's gotten a video
geforce<00:03:05.540> 320m<00:03:06.139> graphics<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.069> i<00:03:07.100> should<00:03:07.340> have

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
geforce 320m graphics so i should have

no<00:03:07.579> problem<00:03:07.910> handling<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:08.660> those<00:03:09.049> HD<00:03:09.530> videos

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
no problem handling all those HD videos

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.830 
no problem handling all those HD videos
and<00:03:10.010> all<00:03:10.069> that<00:03:10.190> kind<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.400> stuff<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.660> good

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
and all that kind of stuff the good

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.900 
and all that kind of stuff the good
thing<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.079> well<00:03:12.859> good<00:03:13.100> in<00:03:13.220> my<00:03:13.340> opinion<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.850> that

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
thing is well good in my opinion is that

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.970 
thing is well good in my opinion is that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
has no hard drive or no optical drive

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.129 
has no hard drive or no optical drive
now<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.790> know<00:03:16.880> you're<00:03:17.180> losing<00:03:17.660> hair<00:03:17.870> drive

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
now I know you're losing hair drive

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.530 
now I know you're losing hair drive
space<00:03:18.410> by<00:03:18.829> putting<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.310> flash<00:03:19.549> memory<00:03:19.940> but<00:03:20.420> you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
space by putting in flash memory but you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.030 
space by putting in flash memory but you
are<00:03:20.660> gaining<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.959> lot<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.230> speed<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.650> speed<00:03:21.920> is

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
are gaining a lot of speed and speed is

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.680 
are gaining a lot of speed and speed is
very<00:03:22.160> important<00:03:22.639> when<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.760> doesn't<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.209> new

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
very important when it doesn't have new

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.300 
very important when it doesn't have new
i<00:03:23.840> series<00:03:24.079> processors<00:03:24.799> that<00:03:24.829> those<00:03:25.069> still

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
i series processors that those still

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.490 
i series processors that those still
only<00:03:25.489> have<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.850> court<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.239> processor<00:03:26.750> so

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
only have the court to do a processor so

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.770 
only have the court to do a processor so
by<00:03:27.620> using<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.950> flash<00:03:28.190> memory<00:03:28.220> they're

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
by using the flash memory they're

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.370 
by using the flash memory they're
compensating<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.049> core<00:03:30.230> 2<00:03:30.350> duo

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
compensating for this core 2 duo

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.530 
compensating for this core 2 duo
processor<00:03:30.910> that's<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.060> way<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.180> look<00:03:32.389> at<00:03:32.480> it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
processor that's the way I look at it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.270 
processor that's the way I look at it
anyway<00:03:32.780> because<00:03:33.260> flash<00:03:33.560> memory<00:03:33.859> is<00:03:33.950> about<00:03:34.099> two

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
anyway because flash memory is about two

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.520 
anyway because flash memory is about two
times<00:03:34.459> faster<00:03:35.000> than<00:03:35.030> normal<00:03:35.690> hard<00:03:36.109> drive<00:03:36.349> and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
times faster than normal hard drive and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
times faster than normal hard drive and
it<00:03:37.310> basically<00:03:37.519> way<00:03:38.090> lighter<00:03:38.359> so<00:03:38.599> that's<00:03:38.750> our

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
it basically way lighter so that's our

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.300 
it basically way lighter so that's our
getting<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.380> late<00:03:39.530> they're<00:03:39.769> just<00:03:39.950> putting<00:03:40.130> at

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
getting so late they're just putting at

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.559 
getting so late they're just putting at
slapping<00:03:40.670> or<00:03:40.730> right<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.180> motor<00:03:41.359> board

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
slapping or right on the motor board

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.449 
slapping or right on the motor board
just<00:03:41.720> leaving<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.109> there<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.410> it's<00:03:43.099> very<00:03:43.400> very

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
just leaving it there and it's very very

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.220 
just leaving it there and it's very very
cool<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.910> gives<00:03:44.060> cool<00:03:44.269> features<00:03:44.599> like<00:03:44.630> instant

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
cool it gives cool features like instant

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.990 
cool it gives cool features like instant

so<00:03:46.690> what's<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.110> pricing<00:03:47.590> well<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.580> flash

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
so what's the pricing well the flash

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.940 
so what's the pricing well the flash
