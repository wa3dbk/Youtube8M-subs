 millions of liters of water through the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.570

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.570
 the same living conditions of the sea 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.140
 so that the habitat of these species is 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.470
 keep filtering 15 times each drop 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.470
 of water 15 times a day that gives us that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 we process 22 million liters 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 in our systems 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.330
 this every day we have a center
