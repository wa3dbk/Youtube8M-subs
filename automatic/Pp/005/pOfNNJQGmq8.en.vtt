00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
alright in this tutorial I'm going to be

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.409 
alright in this tutorial I'm going to be
showing<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.429> guys<00:00:02.460> how<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.760> use<00:00:03.030> subsurface

first<00:01:49.550> metal<00:01:50.120> right<00:01:50.300> texture<00:01:50.600> one<00:01:50.930> we<00:01:51.290> need<00:01:51.440> to

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
first metal right texture one we need to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800 
first metal right texture one we need to
kind<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:51.950> figure<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.610> attributes<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
kind of figure the attributes on this so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.600 
kind of figure the attributes on this so
just<00:01:53.930> double<00:01:54.050> click<00:01:54.320> on<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.800> we're<00:01:55.550> gonna

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
just double click on it and we're gonna

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.550 
just double click on it and we're gonna
make<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:55.820> rideable<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.660> we're<00:01:57.260> going<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.410> open

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
make it rideable and we're going to open

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.280 
make it rideable and we're going to open
up<00:01:57.620> our<00:01:57.800> render<00:01:58.130> settings<00:01:58.550> button<00:01:58.880> up<00:01:59.030> here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
up our render settings button up here

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.210 
up our render settings button up here
let's<00:02:00.290> take<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.470> look<00:02:00.590> at<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:00.770> we're

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
let's take a look at this we're

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.859 
let's take a look at this we're
rendering<00:02:01.430> at<00:02:01.700> six-forty<00:02:02.180> with<00:02:02.360> we<00:02:02.720> need

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
rendering at six-forty with we need

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.680 
rendering at six-forty with we need
twice<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.170> width<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.979> we<00:02:04.130> render<00:02:04.400> has<00:02:04.660> for<00:02:05.660> a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
twice the width that we render has for a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.480 
twice the width that we render has for a
fire<00:02:06.110> file<00:02:06.590> size<00:02:06.770> here<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.190> we're<00:02:07.280> gonna<00:02:07.369> go

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
fire file size here so we're gonna go

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.440 
fire file size here so we're gonna go
1280<00:02:08.060> or<00:02:08.560> 1280<00:02:09.560> yeah<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.910> for<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.240> heights

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
1280 or 1280 yeah then for the heights

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.600 
1280 or 1280 yeah then for the heights
it<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.900> be<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.110> same<00:02:12.320> because<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.370> right<00:02:13.490> or

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it can be the same because it's right or

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.850 
it can be the same because it's right or
not<00:02:13.640> an<00:02:13.850> image<00:02:14.150> nice<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.480> render<00:02:14.750> both<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
not an image nice to render both the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.729 
not an image nice to render both the
front<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.730> back<00:02:16.850> side<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> object<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.590> get

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
front and back side of the object to get

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.500 
front and back side of the object to get
the<00:02:18.830> subsurface<00:02:19.310> scattering<00:02:19.459> effect<00:02:20.090> so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
the subsurface scattering effect so

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.640 
the subsurface scattering effect so
that's<00:02:20.810> why<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.930> asked<00:02:21.080> me<00:02:21.170> twice<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.500> width

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
that's why I asked me twice the width

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.280 
that's why I asked me twice the width
anyways<00:02:22.580> let's<00:02:22.610> make<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.090> file<00:02:23.239> depth<00:02:23.540> 32

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
anyways let's make the file depth 32

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.340 
anyways let's make the file depth 32
bits<00:02:24.620> over<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.940> close<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.330> up<00:02:26.510> okay

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
bits over here just close this up okay

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.870 
bits over here just close this up okay
now<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.770> all<00:02:28.010> configured<00:02:28.400> here<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.850> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
now this is all configured here that a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.470 
now this is all configured here that a
node<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.130> we<00:02:31.220> need<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.400> make<00:02:31.520> some<00:02:31.850> connections

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
node so we need to make some connections

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.590 
node so we need to make some connections
here<00:02:32.930> let's<00:02:33.650> select<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.130> L<00:02:34.489> map<00:02:34.760> double<00:02:35.450> click

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
here let's select the L map double click

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.170 
here let's select the L map double click
on<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:36.050> then<00:02:36.620> drag<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.400> drop<00:02:37.700> using<00:02:38.120> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
on that I then drag and drop using the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.350 
on that I then drag and drop using the
little<00:02:38.390> mouse<00:02:38.530> button<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.820> simply<00:02:40.820> grab<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
little mouse button and simply grab the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.970 
little mouse button and simply grab the
metal<00:02:41.450> right<00:02:41.690> extra<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.470> drop<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.830> into

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
metal right extra one and drop it into

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.120 
metal right extra one and drop it into
the<00:02:43.190> L<00:02:43.940> maps<00:02:44.239> lightmap<00:02:45.080> under<00:02:45.590> light<00:02:45.920> map

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
the L maps lightmap under light map

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.880 
the L maps lightmap under light map
right<00:02:46.550> dropped<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.239> tab<00:02:47.450> throw<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.590> into

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
right dropped on the tab throw this into

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.300 
right dropped on the tab throw this into
there<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:50.330> you're<00:02:50.450> good<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.530> we<00:02:52.040> need<00:02:52.160> to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
there and then you're good so we need to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.030 
there and then you're good so we need to
make<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.610> more<00:02:52.730> connection<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.630> our<00:02:54.040> shade

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
make one more connection on our shade

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.130 
make one more connection on our shade
and<00:02:55.190> engine<00:02:55.430> note<00:02:55.670> here<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.720> need<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.959> actually

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
and engine note here we need to actually

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.530 
and engine note here we need to actually
grab<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.709> el<00:02:57.980> map<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.640> throw<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.209> into<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
grab a el map and throw it into the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.720 
grab a el map and throw it into the

mesh scale it up throw our shader on

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.920 
mesh scale it up throw our shader on
there<00:03:24.680> using<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:24.980> middle<00:03:25.250> mouse<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:26.570> now<00:03:26.690> this

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
there using the middle mouse so now this

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.300 
there using the middle mouse so now this
spear<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.350> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.739> some<00:03:27.920> stuff<00:03:28.100> super

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
spear is going to have some stuff super

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.310 
spear is going to have some stuff super
scattering<00:03:28.910> going<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.299> let's<00:03:30.019> create<00:03:30.260> some

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
scattering going on let's create some

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.510 
scattering going on let's create some
point<00:03:30.680> lights<00:03:31.090> at<00:03:32.090> seven<00:03:32.540> for<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> lit

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
point lights at seven for a lit

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.900 
point lights at seven for a lit
and<00:03:34.850> then<00:03:35.000> create<00:03:35.330> another<00:03:36.520> another<00:03:37.520> light

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
and then create another another light

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.510 
and then create another another light
throw<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.300> behind<00:03:38.420> there<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.280> then<00:03:40.280> I'm<00:03:40.400> gonna

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
throw it behind there and then I'm gonna

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.310 
throw it behind there and then I'm gonna
actually<00:03:41.110> render<00:03:42.110> out<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> shot<00:03:42.650> here<00:03:44.080> okay<00:03:45.080> so

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
actually render out a shot here okay so

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.990 
actually render out a shot here okay so
we're<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:45.890> Maya<00:03:46.160> software<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.790> says<00:03:46.970> right

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
we're in Maya software it says right

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.220 
we're in Maya software it says right
here<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.390> need<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.600> just<00:03:47.780> click<00:03:47.930> on<00:03:48.020> this<00:03:48.170> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
here we need to just click on this and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.890 
here we need to just click on this and
go<00:03:48.560> mental<00:03:49.160> ray<00:03:49.340> then<00:03:49.640> hit<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.090> render<00:03:50.870> button

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
go mental ray then hit the render button

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.390 
go mental ray then hit the render button
again<00:03:51.850> all<00:03:52.850> right<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.920> know<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.130> can

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
again all right and you know you can

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.140 
again all right and you know you can
kind<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:55.790> tell<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:57.170> is<00:03:57.410> um<00:03:58.150> subsurface

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
kind of tell that this is um subsurface

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.870 
kind of tell that this is um subsurface
scattering<00:03:59.350> but<00:04:00.350> let's<00:04:00.530> change<00:04:01.280> some<00:04:01.850> of

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
scattering but let's change some of

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.820 
scattering but let's change some of
these<00:04:02.300> settings<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.870> our<00:04:02.960> sub<00:04:03.590> sort<00:04:03.770> of

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
these settings and our sub sort of

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.410 
these settings and our sub sort of
scatter<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.570> shader<00:04:05.570> here<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.800> you<00:04:07.310> know

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
scatter and a shader here to you know

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.660 
scatter and a shader here to you know
make<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.570> look<00:04:08.750> more<00:04:09.100> visible<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.310> there<00:04:10.550> is

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
make it look more visible that there is

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.910 
make it look more visible that there is
some<00:04:10.880> subsurface<00:04:11.270> scattering<00:04:11.450> going<00:04:12.020> on<00:04:12.140> I'm

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
some subsurface scattering going on I'm

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.300 
some subsurface scattering going on I'm
going<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.250> change<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.120> back<00:04:14.360> SSS<00:04:14.960> wait<00:04:15.800> which

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
going to change the back SSS wait which

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.860 
going to change the back SSS wait which
this<00:04:16.850> light<00:04:17.120> here<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:19.330> because<00:04:20.330> we're

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
this light here is that so because we're

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.360 
this light here is that so because we're
your<00:04:20.959> rendering<00:04:21.290> from<00:04:21.530> if<00:04:21.830> I<00:04:21.890> ran<00:04:22.070> in<00:04:22.130> from<00:04:22.250> the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
your rendering from if I ran in from the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.230 
your rendering from if I ran in from the
side<00:04:22.580> that's<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.180> back<00:04:24.520> wait<00:04:25.520> over<00:04:26.030> running

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
side that's the back wait over running

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.520 
side that's the back wait over running
from<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.510> side<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.900> light<00:04:27.200> will<00:04:27.320> be<00:04:27.440> the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
from this side that light will be the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.290 
from this side that light will be the
back<00:04:27.710> wait<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.730> I'm<00:04:28.790> going<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:28.940> increase<00:04:29.150> the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
back wait so I'm going to increase the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.520 
back wait so I'm going to increase the
weight<00:04:29.540> 1<00:04:30.110> then<00:04:30.710> increase<00:04:31.070> our<00:04:32.050> back<00:04:33.050> SSS

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
weight 1 then increase our back SSS

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.880 
weight 1 then increase our back SSS
radius<00:04:34.220> which<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.760> going<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.890> basically

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
radius which is going to basically

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.360 
radius which is going to basically
control<00:04:37.400> Hall<00:04:37.550> deep<00:04:37.910> and<00:04:38.320> units<00:04:39.320> on<00:04:39.650> our<00:04:40.070> grid

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
control Hall deep and units on our grid

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.060 
control Hall deep and units on our grid
that<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:41.720> lights<00:04:41.870> going<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.170> go<00:04:42.290> through<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.860> I

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
that the lights going to go through it I

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.990 
that the lights going to go through it I
want<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.910> change<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.630> 15

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
want to change this to 15

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.180 
want to change this to 15
and<00:04:47.570> then<00:04:47.720> I'm<00:04:47.870> going<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.200> render<00:04:48.800> out<00:04:48.950> another

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
and then I'm going to render out another

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.380 
and then I'm going to render out another
frame<00:04:49.490> here<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:49.850> should<00:04:49.970> be<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.090> lot<00:04:50.150> more

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
frame here and it should be a lot more

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.300 
frame here and it should be a lot more
visible<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.470> have<00:04:51.740> some<00:04:51.980> subsurface

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
visible that I have some subsurface

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.480 
visible that I have some subsurface
scattering<00:04:52.520> going<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:53.470> well<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.500> could<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.310> could

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
scattering going on well I could I could

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.940 
scattering going on well I could I could
change<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:55.880> see<00:04:56.390> here<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.860> weight<00:04:58.070> too

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.010 

I'm<00:05:02.850> just<00:05:02.910> going<00:05:03.090> all<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.360> way<00:05:03.450> make<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.780> five

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.540 

all<00:05:07.020> right<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.440> as<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:07.860> see<00:05:07.890> here<00:05:08.280> we

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
all right and as you can see here we

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.070 
all right and as you can see here we
have<00:05:08.580> some<00:05:08.850> subsurface<00:05:09.210> scattering<00:05:09.420> going<00:05:09.930> on

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
have some subsurface scattering going on

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.200 
have some subsurface scattering going on
and<00:05:10.380> it<00:05:11.100> looks<00:05:11.250> pretty<00:05:11.400> nice<00:05:11.640> even<00:05:12.030> though<00:05:12.150> you

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
and it looks pretty nice even though you

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.420 
and it looks pretty nice even though you
know<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.450> could<00:05:12.690> throw<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.380> shader<00:05:14.070> onto<00:05:14.400> a

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
know you could throw this shader onto a

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.030 
know you could throw this shader onto a
candle<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.090> would<00:05:15.180> look<00:05:15.240> really<00:05:15.300> nice

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
candle and it would look really nice

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.350 
candle and it would look really nice
just<00:05:17.040> you<00:05:17.100> know<00:05:17.160> play<00:05:17.970> with<00:05:18.090> some<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.270> your

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
just you know play with some of your

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.850 
just you know play with some of your
settings<00:05:18.540> in<00:05:18.810> here<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:19.230> know<00:05:19.290> change<00:05:19.770> them

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
settings in here you know change them

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.390 
settings in here you know change them
around<00:05:19.950> maybe<00:05:20.760> we<00:05:20.850> could<00:05:21.000> change<00:05:21.300> your<00:05:21.390> front

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
around maybe we could change your front

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.280 
around maybe we could change your front
sss<00:05:23.400> weight<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.820> one<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.600> we<00:05:24.720> can<00:05:24.750> increase<00:05:25.050> the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
sss weight to one so we can increase the

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.320 
sss weight to one so we can increase the
effect<00:05:25.650> or<00:05:26.330> noise<00:05:27.410> or<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.770> penetration<00:05:29.460> in

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
effect or noise or the penetration in

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.380 
effect or noise or the penetration in
the<00:05:30.870> front<00:05:31.110> here<00:05:31.670> so<00:05:32.670> why<00:05:32.970> don't<00:05:33.090> we<00:05:33.120> increased

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
the front here so why don't we increased

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.410 
the front here so why don't we increased
f25<00:05:33.840> just<00:05:34.170> make<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.320> look<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:34.620> it's<00:05:34.800> totally

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
f25 just make it look like it's totally

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.580 
f25 just make it look like it's totally
let<00:05:37.790> maybe<00:05:38.790> that's<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:39.000> little<00:05:39.030> too<00:05:39.210> much

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
let maybe that's a little too much

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.900 
let maybe that's a little too much
because<00:05:40.590> like<00:05:40.860> completely<00:05:41.190> penetrates<00:05:41.730> let

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
because like completely penetrates let

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.390 
because like completely penetrates let
make<00:05:42.060> it<00:05:42.180> three<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:43.040> then<00:05:44.040> I'm<00:05:44.220> going<00:05:44.370> to

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
make it three and then I'm going to

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.070 
make it three and then I'm going to
change<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.240> radius<00:05:46.370> 25<00:05:47.690> so<00:05:48.690> it's<00:05:48.840> only<00:05:48.930> gonna

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
change the radius 25 so it's only gonna

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.190 
change the radius 25 so it's only gonna
shine<00:05:49.290> in<00:05:49.470> five<00:05:49.680> units<00:05:50.160> into<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:51.450> other<00:05:52.020> thing

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
shine in five units into the other thing

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.140 
shine in five units into the other thing
there<00:05:52.410> but<00:05:53.190> anyways<00:05:53.460> there<00:05:53.670> you<00:05:53.730> go<00:05:53.850> that's

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
there but anyways there you go that's

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.030 
there but anyways there you go that's
some<00:05:54.450> some<00:05:54.720> subsurface<00:05:55.110> scattering<00:05:55.350> going<00:05:55.890> on

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
some some subsurface scattering going on

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.290 
some some subsurface scattering going on
with<00:05:56.370> some<00:05:56.610> pretty<00:05:57.200> crazy<00:05:58.200> high<00:05:59.150> settings<00:06:00.150> we

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
with some pretty crazy high settings we

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.460 
with some pretty crazy high settings we
could<00:06:00.450> actually<00:06:00.600> turn<00:06:00.870> these<00:06:01.050> down<00:06:01.200> get

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
could actually turn these down get

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.710 
could actually turn these down get
better<00:06:01.680> looking<00:06:01.800> effect<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:02.400> um<00:06:02.630> there<00:06:03.630> you

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
better looking effect but um there you

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.270 
better looking effect but um there you
go<00:06:03.870> you<00:06:04.320> can<00:06:04.470> obviously<00:06:04.590> see<00:06:05.010> here<00:06:05.250> that

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
go you can obviously see here that

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.430 
go you can obviously see here that
that's<00:06:05.550> metal<00:06:06.060> ray<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.630> it's<00:06:07.110> subsurface

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
that's metal ray and it's subsurface

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.660 
that's metal ray and it's subsurface
scattering<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:07.980> thanks<00:06:08.250> for<00:06:08.310> watching<00:06:08.610> this
