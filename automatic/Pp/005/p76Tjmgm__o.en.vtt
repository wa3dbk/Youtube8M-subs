was about 18 or 15 pounds from a sauce

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.170 
was about 18 or 15 pounds from a sauce
it's<00:01:02.660> monkey<00:01:03.110> then<00:01:03.800> my<00:01:04.189> blazer<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.790> also

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
it's monkey then my blazer is also

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.239 
it's monkey then my blazer is also
monkey<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.649> little<00:01:06.829> bit<00:01:06.979> longer

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:07.249 
monkey and this is a little bit longer

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.029 
monkey and this is a little bit longer
of<00:01:07.609> a<00:01:07.729> blazer<00:01:07.939> than<00:01:08.209> I<00:01:08.299> am<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.899> have<00:01:09.139> and<00:01:09.709> that's

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
of a blazer than I am I have and that's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.309 
of a blazer than I am I have and that's
why<00:01:10.189> I<00:01:10.219> got<00:01:10.429> it<00:01:10.579> because<00:01:10.880> um<00:01:11.149> I<00:01:11.509> just<00:01:11.899> like<00:01:12.079> the

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
why I got it because um I just like the

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:13.660 
why I got it because um I just like the
length<00:01:12.439> I<00:01:12.649> think<00:01:12.679> it<00:01:12.920> makes<00:01:13.039> it<00:01:13.310> if<00:01:13.520> you're

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
length I think it makes it if you're

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.760 
length I think it makes it if you're
scared<00:01:13.969> of<00:01:14.060> wearing<00:01:14.329> Blazers<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:15.380> longer

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
scared of wearing Blazers the longer

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.469 
scared of wearing Blazers the longer
length<00:01:15.979> makes<00:01:16.429> it<00:01:16.609> slightly<00:01:16.819> more<00:01:16.939> casual<00:01:17.389> in

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
length makes it slightly more casual in

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.230 
length makes it slightly more casual in
my<00:01:17.600> opinion<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:18.590> as<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.859> can<00:01:18.979> see<00:01:19.060> it's<00:01:20.060> like<00:01:20.209> a

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
my opinion so as you can see it's like a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.559 
my opinion so as you can see it's like a
really<00:01:20.929> really<00:01:21.139> quite<00:01:21.350> longer<00:01:21.939> blazer<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.149> I

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
really really quite longer blazer and I

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.109 
really really quite longer blazer and I
think<00:01:23.779> that<00:01:23.899> was<00:01:24.020> 45<00:01:24.409> pounds<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.189> sizing<00:01:25.969> wise

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
think that was 45 pounds and sizing wise

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.419 
think that was 45 pounds and sizing wise
monkey<00:01:26.689> is<00:01:26.929> really<00:01:27.229> funny<00:01:27.439> with<00:01:27.590> sizing<00:01:28.039> I<00:01:28.219> get

design<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.940> best<00:03:31.120> thing<00:03:31.270> about<00:03:31.330> this<00:03:31.630> is

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
design and the best thing about this is

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.820 
design and the best thing about this is
the<00:03:32.650> price<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.220> was<00:03:33.310> only<00:03:33.520> like<00:03:34.320> 18<00:03:35.320> pounds<00:03:35.739> I

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
the price it was only like 18 pounds I

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.770 
the price it was only like 18 pounds I
think<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.459> like<00:03:36.550> H&amp;M<00:03:37.030> prices<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:37.660> it's

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
think this is like H&amp;M prices so it's

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.229 
think this is like H&amp;M prices so it's
really<00:03:37.989> really<00:03:38.170> affordable<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.790> love<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
color they do another color of that as

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.290 
color they do another color of that as
well<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.250> I'm<00:03:42.430> all<00:03:42.610> about<00:03:42.670> today<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.060> that's

8 I think it was about 40 pounds so I

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.070 
8 I think it was about 40 pounds so I

integrate them into my wardrobe but they

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.490 
integrate them into my wardrobe but they
don't<00:04:58.030> look<00:04:58.120> as<00:04:58.300> expensive<00:04:58.900> as<00:04:59.110> they<00:04:59.259> looked

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
don't look as expensive as they looked

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.420

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
like point issues at the moment and they

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.710 
like point issues at the moment and they
are<00:05:08.400> from<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.490> Zara<00:05:09.699> basic<00:05:10.090> collection<00:05:10.210> they

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
are from the Zara basic collection they

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.390 
are from the Zara basic collection they
were<00:05:10.810> only<00:05:10.960> 30<00:05:11.229> pounds<00:05:11.650> which<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:11.919> think<00:05:12.130> for<00:05:12.370> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
were only 30 pounds which I think for a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.070 
were only 30 pounds which I think for a
good<00:05:12.699> pair<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:12.940> heels<00:05:13.180> is<00:05:13.389> like<00:05:13.570> quite

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
good pair of heels is like quite

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.600 
good pair of heels is like quite
reasonable<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:15.070> only<00:05:15.310> thing<00:05:15.460> is<00:05:15.580> that

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
reasonable the only thing is that

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.490 
reasonable the only thing is that
they're<00:05:15.880> quite<00:05:16.120> tight<00:05:16.479> here<00:05:16.870> because<00:05:17.199> of<00:05:17.349> the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
they're quite tight here because of the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.370 
they're quite tight here because of the
material<00:05:18.490> it's<00:05:18.639> not<00:05:18.699> leather<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.260> was
