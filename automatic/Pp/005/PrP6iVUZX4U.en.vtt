00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 i 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello guys that analysts and will follow 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 suter and here we are again in 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 minecraft with rudolf is terrain 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 fantastic wonderful and beautiful eyes 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 blue that came out in this last 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 skins update the truth that is 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.180
 one of the ones that I like the most seems 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 which is great and now what is it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.950
 let's see let's see the utilization 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 of the sender but worth of the pearls of 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.250
 leander the eyes of leander or the bitches 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.930
 of selling there are many people who are eyes 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.690
 of people who say they are pearls 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.669
 well the truth whatever the under 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.620
 but the truth had come out in the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 previous update but we did not 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.400
 we could have used could not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.650
 use we do not know why but finally 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.050
 they have already activated how they are used 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.140
 than throw it out simply by giving it to lt 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 against the area to which we want 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.540
 teletransportarnos is to say yes I want 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 after teleporting gives me that area of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.800
 floor from there for example I throw it to you 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 in the castle lt must say one thing 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 guys subtract approximately two 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.010
 hearts and means you have to have 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 very careful to look at it threw it against 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 and a beige two hearts and a half that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.399
 they go to hell or three more are worth 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.830
 they serve to teleport to what 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.080
 it's a nearby area like it can be 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.940
 although it was not a little high there is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 be careful with those guys that's 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.630
 something I also wanted to tell you for example 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 look at that area over there that cave if I see 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 that you would not get to arrive instead of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 make a ladder I throw it to go and there 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 he came to the cave already worth guys is a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 simple way to teleport yourself 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 you are spending one every time you have 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.970
 transport of teleport but 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.260
 It is also to say that it is a good way 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.870
 to reach areas a little bit 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.530
 inaccessible okay guys I keep saying 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.170
 the same 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 subtraction worth subtracts two hearts and a half 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 three hearts you have to have a lot 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.610
 careful and another thing than the one that there 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.500
 to be careful too 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.330
 in the case of hitting a wall by 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.130
 example if I give this wall the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.720
 height of which I did not see there's going to 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.390
 be from that wall I'm going to do the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.040
 hurt the year 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.020
 let's say equitable is to the area where 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.470
 I hit is if I stick in that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.870
 area there but I'm going to fall in here 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 Perfect because it is like there 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.869
 fallen from that height where he hit the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 leg okay guys then what have 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 very much taken care of the truth that what 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.200
 I say to teleport to areas a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.300
 A little bit far is fantastic, you see 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's easier than transporting from 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.570
 upstairs downstairs downstairs because I 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.760
 I can try to throw so leads to the top 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.430
 see where I got to see to see where it gets 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.810
 I do not see it and look and see and tried 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.890
 get to some area but I passed 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.600
 then have a little bit of care 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.520
 but the truth is that it is very good 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.800
 fantastic to be able to make you 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.390
 transportations and for example I want me 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.470
 go to another part of there I do not know where 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.420
 will go to see where it's going for where it's going 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.190
 oysters look at where I went to stop the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.600
 it's really fine to me 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.100
 it's quite fun 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.200
 where are you ear where those cows 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.450
 quickly by simply having a 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.910
 an inter but and take where the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.590
 vaquitas look there I give them the wheat for 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.520
 that they fall in love and there's no more 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.320
 wheat there is no alarm nothing happens and nothing 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.830
 guys what I was saying I hope you 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.650
 I liked nothing else I'm going to ask you what 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.330
 what is that like favorites share the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.640
 social networks and bringing more tidbits 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.290
