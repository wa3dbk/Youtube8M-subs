00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
so anyway now I've advertised BDNF

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.590 
so anyway now I've advertised BDNF
sufficiently<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.170> hope<00:00:04.529> that<00:00:04.950> if<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.460> ran<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.299> PR

sufficiently I hope that if I ran a PR

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.540 
sufficiently I hope that if I ran a PR
campaign<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:07.230> would<00:00:07.379> all<00:00:07.529> want<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.160> go<00:00:08.309> out

campaign you would all want to go out

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.140 
campaign you would all want to go out
and<00:00:08.790> buy<00:00:08.970> some<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.200> point<00:00:10.469> being<00:00:10.590> now<00:00:11.150> no

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and buy some and the point being now no

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.539 
and buy some and the point being now no
you<00:00:12.210> cannot<00:00:12.599> buy<00:00:12.840> some<00:00:13.110> but<00:00:13.710> how<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.280> get

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you cannot buy some but how can you get

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.720 
you cannot buy some but how can you get
it<00:00:14.700> well<00:00:14.870> one<00:00:15.870> way<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.199> getting<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
it well one way of getting it is to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.679 
it well one way of getting it is to
exercise<00:00:18.439> so<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.279> see<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.660> have

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
exercise so as you can see here we have

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.130 
exercise so as you can see here we have

going<00:00:47.460> mainly<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.149> talk<00:00:48.329> about<00:00:48.450> BDNF<00:00:49.079> these

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
going mainly to talk about BDNF these

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.670 
going mainly to talk about BDNF these
are<00:00:50.039> controls<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.090> left<00:00:51.660> passive<00:00:52.170> these

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
are controls that are left passive these

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
are controls that are left passive these
have<00:00:52.920> exercised<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.670> three<00:00:53.940> days<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> these

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
have exercised for three days and these

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.350 
have exercised for three days and these
have<00:00:55.170> exercised<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.920> seven<00:00:56.219> days<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.879> as<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
have exercised for seven days so as you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.080 
have exercised for seven days so as you
can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.680> three<00:00:58.680> days<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.160> exercise<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> even

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
can see three days of exercise and even

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
can see three days of exercise and even
more<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> week<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> exercise<00:01:01.410> will<00:01:01.980> boost

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
more so a week of exercise will boost

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 
more so a week of exercise will boost
the<00:01:02.609> production<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.270> brain<00:01:03.989> derived

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the production of brain derived

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
the production of brain derived
neurotrophic<00:01:04.500> factor<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.060> matter

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
neurotrophic factor and for that matter

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.130 
neurotrophic factor and for that matter
of<00:01:06.600> crap<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> psilocin<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.060> these<00:01:09.659> substances

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
of crap and psilocin so these substances

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.730 
of crap and psilocin so these substances
that<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.119> clearly<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.510> many<00:01:13.140> experiments

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that are clearly in many experiments

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.789 
that are clearly in many experiments
shown<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> importance<00:01:15.750> relative<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
shown so be of importance relative to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.420 
shown so be of importance relative to
learning<00:01:17.640> memory<00:01:18.530> survival<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.590> neurons<00:01:19.950> etc

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
learning memory survival of neurons etc

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.200 
learning memory survival of neurons etc
are<00:01:20.670> boosted<00:01:21.420> by<00:01:21.720> physical<00:01:22.380> activity<00:01:23.210> now

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
are boosted by physical activity now

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
are boosted by physical activity now
this<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> another<00:01:25.860> slide<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.759> should<00:01:26.939> not

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
this is another slide that we should not

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
this is another slide that we should not
spend<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.540> too<00:01:27.720> much<00:01:27.840> time<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
spend all too much time on what I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.609 
spend all too much time on what I
primarily<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> show<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
primarily want to show is that there's a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.929 
primarily want to show is that there's a
particular<00:01:32.270> receptor<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.700> P

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
particular receptor this one here for P

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
particular receptor this one here for P
D<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.119> F<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.259> brain<00:01:37.650> derived

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
D and F so when brain derived

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.490 
D and F so when brain derived
neurotrophic<00:01:38.070> factor<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> produced<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
neurotrophic factor is produced and is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.620 
neurotrophic factor is produced and is
produced<00:01:40.860> both<00:01:41.070> by<00:01:41.310> glial<00:01:41.640> cells<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.329> by

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
produced both by glial cells and by

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.999 
produced both by glial cells and by
neurons<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:44.009> affects<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.170> receptor<00:01:46.170> which

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
neurons it affects this receptor which

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
neurons it affects this receptor which
got<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.460> number<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.970> consequences<00:01:48.530> one<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> them

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
got a number of consequences one of them

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.039 
got a number of consequences one of them
is<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.700> boost<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.450> production<00:01:51.659> of

is actually to boost the production of
creb<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> those<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.310> talked<00:01:53.520> about

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
creb one of those that we talked about

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.580 
creb one of those that we talked about
before<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.329> others<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.200> boost<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
production of a BDNF itself so actually

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.719 
production of a BDNF itself so actually
while<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.969> BDNF<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
we have a positive feedback loop here

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.600 
we have a positive feedback loop here
the<00:02:06.060> production<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.140> cell<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.590> BDNF<00:02:07.979> will

the production in the cell of BDNF will

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.630 
the production in the cell of BDNF will
actually<00:02:09.119> via<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.200> receptor<00:02:10.830> boost<00:02:11.220> even

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
actually via this receptor boost even

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.440 
actually via this receptor boost even
more<00:02:11.849> production

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
more production

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.170 
more production
of<00:02:12.540> BDNF<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.620> once<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:14.849> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
of BDNF so once you get this kind of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.020 
of BDNF so once you get this kind of
positive<00:02:15.420> loop<00:02:16.140> started<00:02:16.709> you're<00:02:17.489> likely<00:02:17.700> to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
positive loop started you're likely to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.900 
positive loop started you're likely to
get<00:02:18.300> some<00:02:18.540> good<00:02:18.810> results<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.950> also<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.700> course

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
get some good results it also of course

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.339 
get some good results it also of course
means<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.510> likely<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.170> some

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
means that you're likely to have some

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.559 
means that you're likely to have some
neuroscientist<00:02:23.129> very<00:02:23.580> interested<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.360> this

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
neuroscientist very interested in this

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.610 
neuroscientist very interested in this
receptor<00:02:25.260> because<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.670> case<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:28.050> true<00:02:28.379> that

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
receptor because in case it is true that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.850 
receptor because in case it is true that
positive<00:02:29.519> effects<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.319> exercise<00:02:31.319> actually

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
positive effects of exercise actually

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.610 
positive effects of exercise actually
has<00:02:32.400> something<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.150> BDNF<00:02:33.810> blocking

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
has something to do with BDNF blocking

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.740 
has something to do with BDNF blocking
this<00:02:34.950> receptor<00:02:35.580> should<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.720> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
this receptor should be a way of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.960 
this receptor should be a way of
preventing<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.549> minute<00:02:38.700> you're

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
preventing it so in a minute you're

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030 
preventing it so in a minute you're
going<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.269> see<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:39.630> results<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.200> which<00:02:40.500> this

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
going to see some results in which this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.949 
going to see some results in which this
receptor<00:02:41.580> has<00:02:41.670> been<00:02:41.819> blocked<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> let's<00:02:42.780> see

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
receptor has been blocked and let's see

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.860 
receptor has been blocked and let's see
what's<00:02:43.260> happening<00:02:44.040> under<00:02:44.489> such

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
what's happening under such

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.949 
what's happening under such
circumstances<00:02:46.130> well<00:02:47.130> first<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> all<00:02:47.849> you<00:02:48.690> have

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
circumstances well first of all you have

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.800 
circumstances well first of all you have
here<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:50.430> animals<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:52.790> exercising

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
here some animals that are exercising

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.509 
here some animals that are exercising
you'll<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:54.959> some<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.590> are<00:02:55.799> just<00:02:55.829> having

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
you'll have some that are just having

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.089 
you'll have some that are just having
brain<00:02:56.970> injury<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:58.920> some<00:02:59.489> here<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.510> are

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
brain injury you have some here that are

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.550 
brain injury you have some here that are
exercising<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:05.160> some<00:03:05.910> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
exercising and you have here some that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.009 
exercising and you have here some that
maybe<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.680> should<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.160> say<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
maybe I should just say this is the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.410 
maybe I should just say this is the
protein<00:03:10.019> levels<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:11.220> are<00:03:11.280> some<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
protein levels these are some of the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.289 
protein levels these are some of the
consequences<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.410> BDNF<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.160> once<00:03:15.120> you

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
consequences this is BDNF and once you

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.259 
consequences this is BDNF and once you
block<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:16.019> receptor<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.920> get<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.609> reduction

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
block this receptor you get a reduction

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.039 
block this receptor you get a reduction
so<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:19.230> goes<00:03:19.620> via<00:03:20.040> BDNF<00:03:20.730> that's<00:03:21.150> clear<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.780> this

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
so it goes via BDNF that's clear in this

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.129 
so it goes via BDNF that's clear in this
case<00:03:22.319> here<00:03:22.920> are<00:03:23.130> some<00:03:23.609> functional<00:03:24.299> results

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
case here are some functional results

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.110 
case here are some functional results
showing<00:03:25.350> pretty<00:03:25.829> much<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.160> same<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.819> have

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
showing pretty much the same you have

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.199 
showing pretty much the same you have
again<00:03:27.690> some<00:03:28.260> animals<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.489> lesion<00:03:30.000> and

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
again some animals that are lesion and

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.780 
again some animals that are lesion and
this<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> cognitive<00:03:31.440> task<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:32.220> time<00:03:32.519> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
this is a cognitive task this time a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.210 
this is a cognitive task this time a
place<00:03:33.060> learning<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.630> water<00:03:33.840> maze<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.319> you

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
place learning in a water maze and you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.180 
place learning in a water maze and you
have<00:03:35.459> here<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.660> shams<00:03:37.049> these<00:03:37.590> are<00:03:37.769> normal

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
have here the shams these are normal

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.390 
have here the shams these are normal
animals<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:39.180> control<00:03:39.660> operated<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.250> is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
animals just control operated so this is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.690 
animals just control operated so this is
the<00:03:41.609> level<00:03:42.319> this<00:03:43.319> is<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.769> criterion<00:03:44.459> score

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
the level this is the criterion score

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
the level this is the criterion score
this<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.209> short<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.810> number<00:03:46.410> indicating

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
this is in short and a number indicating

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.309 
this is in short and a number indicating
how<00:03:47.220> well<00:03:47.430> they<00:03:47.609> they<00:03:48.180> solve<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.630> task<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
how well they they solve the task the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.789 
how well they they solve the task the
higher<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.799> better<00:03:50.120> these<00:03:51.120> are<00:03:51.650> animals<00:03:52.650> that

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
higher the better these are animals that

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.449 
higher the better these are animals that
are<00:03:53.579> well<00:03:54.329> first<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.799> here<00:03:56.130> some

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
are well first of all you have here some

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.120 
are well first of all you have here some
leash<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.910> animals<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:57.900> as<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.500> here

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
leash and animals so as you can see here

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.920 
leash and animals so as you can see here
is<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.639> consequence<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.420> leash<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:00.599> they

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
is the consequence of the leash and they

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.020 
is the consequence of the leash and they
are<00:04:01.079> clearly<00:04:01.440> impaired<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.000> have

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
are clearly impaired but here you have

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.470 
are clearly impaired but here you have
some<00:04:03.450> animals<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.290> are<00:04:04.650> given<00:04:05.220> some<00:04:06.000> time<00:04:06.239> in

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
some animals that are given some time in

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.870 
some animals that are given some time in
a<00:04:06.569> running<00:04:06.900> wheel<00:04:07.049> they<00:04:07.349> are<00:04:07.410> exercising<00:04:08.190> they

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
a running wheel they are exercising they

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.599 
a running wheel they are exercising they
have<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.540> same<00:04:09.750> lesion<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.380> these<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.400> the

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
have the same lesion as these so the

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.890 
have the same lesion as these so the
lesion<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.269> same<00:04:12.480> but<00:04:12.750> they're

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
lesion is the same but they're

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.289 
lesion is the same but they're
exercising<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:13.799> as<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.549> see<00:04:14.790> there's<00:04:15.209> a

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
exercising and as you can see there's a

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.779 
exercising and as you can see there's a
very<00:04:15.690> clear<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.320> significant<00:04:16.950> improvement

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
very clear and significant improvement

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.819 
very clear and significant improvement
of<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.329> task<00:04:18.570> performance<00:04:19.139> when<00:04:19.680> you

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
of the task performance when you

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.140 
of the task performance when you
exercise<00:04:20.160> however<00:04:21.090> if<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.140> block<00:04:22.440> that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
exercise however if you block that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.720 
exercise however if you block that
receptor

is very much studied in many instances
we<00:06:42.830> know<00:06:43.040> that<00:06:43.250> it<00:06:43.370> plays<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:43.580> significant<00:06:44.330> role

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
we know that it plays a significant role

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.260 
we know that it plays a significant role
in<00:06:44.720> learning<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.230> memory<00:06:45.460> and<00:06:46.460> lots<00:06:46.970> of<00:06:47.120> the

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
in learning and memory and lots of the

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.240 
in learning and memory and lots of the
animal<00:06:47.630> models<00:06:47.960> actually<00:06:48.530> focus<00:06:48.950> almost

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
animal models actually focus almost

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.210 
animal models actually focus almost
exclusively<00:06:49.790> on<00:06:50.510> hippocampus<00:06:51.410> and<00:06:51.530> lots<00:06:52.070> of

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
exclusively on hippocampus and lots of

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.700 
exclusively on hippocampus and lots of
the<00:06:52.370> studies<00:06:52.790> looking<00:06:53.540> whether<00:06:54.140> for<00:06:54.680> instance

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
the studies looking whether for instance

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.910 
the studies looking whether for instance
exercise<00:06:55.430> will<00:06:55.910> influence<00:06:56.300> BDNF<00:06:56.990> have<00:06:57.380> almost

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
exercise will influence BDNF have almost

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.570 
exercise will influence BDNF have almost
exclusively<00:06:58.640> looked<00:06:59.030> at<00:06:59.240> the<00:07:00.010> levels<00:07:01.010> of<00:07:01.220> BDNF

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
exclusively looked at the levels of BDNF

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.720 
exclusively looked at the levels of BDNF
within<00:07:02.540> the<00:07:02.930> hippocampus<00:07:03.160> now<00:07:04.160> that<00:07:04.520> might

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
within the hippocampus now that might

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.790 
within the hippocampus now that might
actually<00:07:04.940> be<00:07:05.240> a<00:07:05.270> problem<00:07:05.540> because<00:07:06.080> you<00:07:06.530> tend

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
actually be a problem because you tend

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.670 
actually be a problem because you tend
there<00:07:07.400> to<00:07:07.730> believe<00:07:08.060> maybe<00:07:08.720> wrongly<00:07:09.080> that

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
there to believe maybe wrongly that

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.010 
there to believe maybe wrongly that
factors<00:07:10.160> influencing<00:07:10.790> BDNF<00:07:11.360> in<00:07:11.690> the

factors influencing BDNF in the

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.110 
factors influencing BDNF in the
hippocampus<00:07:12.620> would<00:07:13.100> influence<00:07:13.430> the<00:07:13.700> rest<00:07:13.910> of

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
hippocampus would influence the rest of

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.030 
hippocampus would influence the rest of
the<00:07:14.240> brain<00:07:14.450> in<00:07:14.720> the<00:07:14.840> same<00:07:15.020> ways<00:07:15.260> there's<00:07:15.890> no

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
the brain in the same ways there's no

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.790 
the brain in the same ways there's no
saying<00:07:16.280> that<00:07:16.580> is<00:07:16.730> the<00:07:16.940> case<00:07:16.970> and<00:07:17.630> actually<00:07:18.380> I'm

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
saying that is the case and actually I'm

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.340 
saying that is the case and actually I'm
going<00:07:19.070> to<00:07:19.190> show<00:07:19.370> a<00:07:19.550> little<00:07:19.730> bit<00:07:19.880> later<00:07:20.350> reasons

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
going to show a little bit later reasons

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.010 
going to show a little bit later reasons
not<00:07:21.740> to<00:07:21.800> believe<00:07:22.220> so<00:07:22.400> so<00:07:23.000> here<00:07:23.540> you<00:07:23.660> can<00:07:23.780> see

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
not to believe so so here you can see

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.920 
not to believe so so here you can see
that<00:07:24.460> compared<00:07:25.460> to<00:07:25.640> those<00:07:25.850> that<00:07:26.120> are<00:07:26.300> passive

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
that compared to those that are passive

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.550 
that compared to those that are passive
we<00:07:27.230> have<00:07:27.470> boost<00:07:27.950> of<00:07:28.270> BDNF<00:07:29.270> production<00:07:30.260> within

various parts of the campus and

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.320 
various parts of the campus and
furthermore<00:07:33.590> if<00:07:33.950> we<00:07:34.340> take<00:07:34.580> a<00:07:34.790> learning<00:07:35.120> task

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
furthermore if we take a learning task

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.430 
furthermore if we take a learning task
here<00:07:36.280> this<00:07:37.280> are<00:07:37.550> these<00:07:37.880> are<00:07:38.150> the<00:07:38.300> first<00:07:38.480> 66

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 
here this are these are the first 66

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.490

in<00:07:42.740> water<00:07:43.010> maze<00:07:43.250> the<00:07:43.760> red<00:07:44.060> ones<00:07:44.360> are<00:07:44.570> those

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750 
in water maze the red ones are those

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.440 
in water maze the red ones are those
exercising<00:07:45.680> and<00:07:45.830> as<00:07:46.370> you<00:07:46.520> can<00:07:46.670> see<00:07:46.730> they<00:07:47.390> do

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.450 
exercising and as you can see they do

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.890 
exercising and as you can see they do
have<00:07:47.990> a<00:07:48.650> quicker<00:07:49.340> learning<00:07:50.120> curve<00:07:50.360> so

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:50.900 
have a quicker learning curve so

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.880 
have a quicker learning curve so
exercise<00:07:51.620> does<00:07:51.980> in<00:07:52.250> the<00:07:52.550> normals<00:07:52.970> improve

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:53.890 
exercise does in the normals improve

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.520 
exercise does in the normals improve
cognitive<00:07:54.890> learning
