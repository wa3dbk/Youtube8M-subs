I've seen a lot of posts on rent lists
about<00:00:09.350> wheel<00:00:10.070> bearings<00:00:10.580> and<00:00:10.790> how<00:00:10.879> wheel

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
about wheel bearings and how wheel

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.190 
about wheel bearings and how wheel
bearing<00:00:11.360> should<00:00:11.510> be<00:00:11.600> done<00:00:11.750> and<00:00:11.930> things<00:00:12.080> like

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
bearing should be done and things like

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.080 
bearing should be done and things like
that<00:00:12.440> so<00:00:13.009> I<00:00:13.040> thought<00:00:13.309> I<00:00:13.519> would<00:00:13.580> go<00:00:13.880> through<00:00:14.059> a

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
that so I thought I would go through a

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.850 
that so I thought I would go through a

back<00:00:23.689> together<00:00:23.869> in<00:00:24.800> preparation<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:25.430> put<00:00:25.580> a

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
back together in preparation I put a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.279 
back together in preparation I put a
little<00:00:25.730> piece<00:00:25.850> of<00:00:25.970> string<00:00:26.060> up<00:00:26.359> here<00:00:26.390> now<00:00:26.869> when

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
little piece of string up here now when

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.890 
little piece of string up here now when
you<00:00:27.380> tie<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:28.060> caliper<00:00:29.060> up<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:29.510> that<00:00:29.689> doesn't

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
you tie the caliper up so that doesn't

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.679 
you tie the caliper up so that doesn't
stress<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.740> brake<00:00:31.279> line<00:00:31.460> when<00:00:32.119> it<00:00:32.210> hangs<00:00:32.390> so

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
stress the brake line when it hangs so

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.420 
stress the brake line when it hangs so
the<00:00:32.780> first<00:00:32.960> step<00:00:33.110> I'm<00:00:33.290> going<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.530> open<00:00:34.160> up<00:00:34.340> the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
the first step I'm going to open up the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.729 
the first step I'm going to open up the
caliper<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:36.460> brake<00:00:37.460> pad<00:00:38.170> I<00:00:39.170> like<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.620> use

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.979 
caliper and the brake pad I like to use
two<00:00:39.920> different<00:00:40.330> just<00:00:41.330> bull<00:00:41.479> wrenches<00:00:41.839> and<00:00:41.960> I

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
two different just bull wrenches and I

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.030 
two different just bull wrenches and I
do<00:00:42.049> this<00:00:42.260> adjustable<00:00:42.830> pliers<00:00:44.379> squeeze<00:00:45.379> open

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
do this adjustable pliers squeeze open

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.560 
do this adjustable pliers squeeze open
the<00:00:46.250> trapdoor<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:47.420> pads<00:00:47.629> are<00:00:47.780> now<00:00:47.900> accessible

then<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:51.140> larger<00:00:52.010> wrench<00:00:52.960> that<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.019> use<00:00:54.320> to

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
then a larger wrench that I use to

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.270 
then a larger wrench that I use to
squeeze<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.269> backing<00:00:57.110> plate<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.710> pad<00:00:57.949> and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
the edge of the caliper it does more of

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.350 
the edge of the caliper it does more of
the<00:01:00.650> caliper<00:01:00.979> up<00:01:01.159> a<00:01:01.220> little<00:01:01.369> bit<00:01:01.549> I<00:01:01.729> don't<00:01:02.030> care

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
the caliper up a little bit I don't care

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.939 
the caliper up a little bit I don't care
this<00:01:02.540> is<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.689> track<00:01:02.989> part<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.379> don't<00:01:03.530> expect<00:01:03.799> it

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
this is the track part I don't expect it

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.010 
this is the track part I don't expect it
to<00:01:04.010> be<00:01:04.100> pretty<00:01:04.400> if<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.479> have<00:01:05.689> just<00:01:05.840> painted

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
to be pretty if you have just painted

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.260 
to be pretty if you have just painted
calipers<00:01:06.320> or<00:01:06.650> something<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.880> might<00:01:08.060> want<00:01:08.240> to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
calipers or something you might want to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.120

put a little block of wood or do

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.290 
put a little block of wood or do
something<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> little<00:01:10.580> bit<00:01:10.670> more<00:01:10.820> gentle<00:01:11.120> than

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
something a little bit more gentle than

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.810 
something a little bit more gentle than
that<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:11.870> squeeze<00:01:12.260> one<00:01:12.440> side<00:01:12.680> squeeze<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
that I just squeeze one side squeeze the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.090 
that I just squeeze one side squeeze the
other<00:01:13.940> side<00:01:14.410> that<00:01:15.410> just<00:01:15.470> gives<00:01:15.770> me<00:01:15.920> enough

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
other side that just gives me enough

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.970 
other side that just gives me enough
space<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.370> then<00:01:16.670> pull<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.060> pads<00:01:17.510> out<00:01:17.920> how<00:01:18.920> do

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
space to then pull the pads out how do

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.860 
space to then pull the pads out how do
then<00:01:19.220> going<00:01:19.370> to<00:01:19.430> slide<00:01:19.670> right<00:01:19.700> at<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.480> have

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
then going to slide right at I have

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.240 
then going to slide right at I have
enough<00:01:21.050> thickness<00:01:21.350> for<00:01:21.470> my<00:01:21.560> next<00:01:21.770> track<00:01:21.950> event

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
enough thickness for my next track event

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.890 
enough thickness for my next track event
so<00:01:22.580> I'm<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:22.730> going<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.910> set<00:01:23.030> these<00:01:23.150> aside<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
so I'm just going to set these aside and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.930 
so I'm just going to set these aside and
they'll<00:01:24.440> go<00:01:24.590> back<00:01:24.800> yes<00:01:25.070> when<00:01:25.610> I'm<00:01:25.730> ready

next<00:01:28.940> I'm<00:01:29.150> going<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.540> undo<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.970> caliper

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
next I'm going to undo the caliper

bar just to uh just loosen them up so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.060 
bar just to uh just loosen them up so
I've<00:01:45.320> tried<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.650> complete<00:01:45.980> tight<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:48.040> then<00:01:49.040> a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
I've tried to complete tight and then a

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.610 
I've tried to complete tight and then a

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
hose from the breaker bar just use a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.230 
hose from the breaker bar just use a
regular<00:01:51.740> ratcheting<00:01:52.130> using<00:01:52.850> by<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.000> way

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
regular ratcheting using by the way

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.780 
regular ratcheting using by the way
although<00:01:53.780> if<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:54.890> lose<00:01:55.220> them<00:01:55.370> enough<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.670> could

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
although if I lose them enough I could

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.780 
although if I lose them enough I could
probably<00:01:55.970> even<00:01:56.120> do<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.390> by<00:01:56.510> hand<00:01:57.640> caliper<00:01:58.640> from

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
probably even do it by hand caliper from

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.640 
probably even do it by hand caliper from
then<00:02:00.729> over<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:04.430> rotor<00:02:05.200> got<00:02:06.200> my<00:02:06.320> string

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
then over the the rotor got my string

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.589 
then over the the rotor got my string
ready<00:02:06.860> here<00:02:07.190> just<00:02:07.670> loop<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.000> underneath
