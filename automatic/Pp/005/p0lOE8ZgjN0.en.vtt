00:06:50.179 --> 00:07:03.320 
well they need to get a score in the
high<00:06:50.419> 90s<00:06:50.959> to<00:06:51.949> be<00:06:52.219> in<00:06:52.279> contention<00:06:52.819> for<00:06:52.999> a<00:06:53.239> medal

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:28.950 

not

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.990 

and<00:07:29.960> I<00:07:30.050> think<00:07:30.110> I<00:07:30.350> detected<00:07:30.950> the<00:07:31.190> odds<00:07:31.460> shake<00:07:31.820> of

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 
and I think I detected the odds shake of

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.880 
and I think I detected the odds shake of
the<00:07:32.030> head<00:07:32.300> then<00:07:32.570> in<00:07:32.840> acknowledgment<00:07:33.560> there<00:07:33.770> in

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:33.890 
the head then in acknowledgment there in

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.620 
the head then in acknowledgment there in
third<00:07:34.190> placing<00:07:34.880> at<00:07:35.000> the<00:07:35.120> moment<00:07:36.160> two<00:07:37.160> teams

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630 
third placing at the moment two teams

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.350 
third placing at the moment two teams
still<00:07:38.630> to<00:07:38.930> perform
