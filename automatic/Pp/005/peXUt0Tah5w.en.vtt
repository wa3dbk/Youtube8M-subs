you can also back - after the string is
completed<00:00:45.739> if<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.070> manage<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.520> avoid<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
initial forward + - then you can punish

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.229 
initial forward + - then you can punish
him<00:00:50.129> before<00:00:50.399> he<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> chance<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.940> complete

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
him before he has a chance to complete

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.010 
him before he has a chance to complete
the<00:00:51.390> screen

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.210 

Superman's<00:00:58.020> overheads<00:00:58.470> don't<00:00:58.710> lead<00:00:58.829> into<00:00:59.040> big

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
Superman's overheads don't lead into big

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.399 
Superman's overheads don't lead into big
damage<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.239> his<00:01:00.330> low<00:01:00.480> attacks<00:01:00.780> certainly<00:01:01.230> do

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.380 

so<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.070> best<00:01:07.219> to<00:01:07.310> block<00:01:07.549> low<00:01:07.790> just<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.240> case

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
so it's best to block low just in case

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.490 
so it's best to block low just in case
your<00:01:08.539> opponent<00:01:08.840> tries<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:09.079> cancel<00:01:09.380> their

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
your opponent tries to cancel their

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.190 
your opponent tries to cancel their
string<00:01:09.740> into<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:09.979> low<00:01:10.159> scoop<00:01:16.689> his<00:01:17.689> four<00:01:17.990> plus

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
string into a low scoop his four plus

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.630 
string into a low scoop his four plus
three<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.470> somewhat<00:01:18.860> fast<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.369> leads<00:01:19.520> into

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
three is somewhat fast and leads into

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.410 
three is somewhat fast and leads into
big<00:01:19.909> damage

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.880 

so<00:01:27.990> watch<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> block

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
so watch out for it and block

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.360 
so watch out for it and block
appropriately<00:01:30.830> also<00:01:31.830> watch<00:01:31.979> out<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
appropriately also watch out for is

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.280 
appropriately also watch out for is
flying<00:01:32.610> ground<00:01:32.940> smash<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.140> cross

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.369 

certain<00:02:19.569> characters<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:20.110> leave<00:02:20.230> their

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.030 

which<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> good<00:02:25.780> strategy<00:02:25.959> because<00:02:26.920> it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
which is a good strategy because it

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.500
