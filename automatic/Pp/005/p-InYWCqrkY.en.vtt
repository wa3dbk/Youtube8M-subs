it's<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.590> look<00:01:26.710> like<00:01:26.830> this<00:01:27.100> basically

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
it's going to look like this basically

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's going to look like this basically
you<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:28.180> made<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.750> sleeve<00:01:29.049> opening<00:01:29.470> for

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
you have made a sleeve opening for

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.210 
you have made a sleeve opening for
yourself<00:01:30.990> once<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.080> have<00:01:32.230> sewn<00:01:32.440> both<00:01:32.800> sides

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
yourself once you have sewn both sides

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.800 
yourself once you have sewn both sides
you're<00:01:33.520> going<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.730> lay<00:01:33.880> out<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.210> scarf<00:01:34.480> on<00:01:34.690> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
you're going to lay out the scarf on the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.930 
you're going to lay out the scarf on the
floor<00:01:35.050> once<00:01:35.230> again<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.740> just<00:01:35.770> make<00:01:36.400> sure<00:01:36.580> all

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
floor once again and just make sure all

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.960 
floor once again and just make sure all
of<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.360> edges<00:01:37.390> line<00:01:37.960> up

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of the edges line up

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
of the edges line up
this<00:01:39.480> part<00:01:39.750> probably<00:01:40.080> takes<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> longest<00:01:41.070> if

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this part probably takes the longest if

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.840 
this part probably takes the longest if
your<00:01:41.520> scarf<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> very<00:01:42.300> delicate<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:43.050> mine<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so just make sure that it's as best as

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.120 
so just make sure that it's as best as
you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.650> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.830> grab<00:01:50.010> your

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

you can do and you're going to grab your
measuring<00:01:50.460> tape<00:01:50.550> again<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> measure<00:01:51.660> the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
measuring tape again and measure the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.179 
measuring tape again and measure the
long<00:01:52.320> open<00:01:53.010> edge

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.980 

when<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.789> find<00:01:57.999> the<00:01:58.119> center<00:01:58.299> measurement<00:01:58.869> of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
when you find the center measurement of

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.149 
when you find the center measurement of
this<00:01:59.200> you're<00:01:59.439> going<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.619> cut<00:01:59.799> through<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.130> top

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
this you're going to cut through the top

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.880 
this you're going to cut through the top
layer<00:02:00.850> do<00:02:01.509> not<00:02:01.689> cut<00:02:01.929> through<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.740> bottom

layer do not cut through the bottom

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.700 
layer do not cut through the bottom
layer<00:02:03.219> my<00:02:03.969> fabric<00:02:04.719> actually<00:02:04.869> had<00:02:05.170> lines<00:02:05.409> on<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
layer my fabric actually had lines on it

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.529 
layer my fabric actually had lines on it
so<00:02:05.859> I<00:02:05.920> just<00:02:05.979> pushed<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:07.090> measuring<00:02:07.420> tape

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.690 
so I just pushed the measuring tape
aside<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.259> cut<00:02:08.470> straight<00:02:08.890> up<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.549> the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.530 
aside and cut straight up one of the
lines<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.269> pattern<00:02:12.299> finally<00:02:13.299> you're

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
lines in the pattern finally you're

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.330 
lines in the pattern finally you're
going<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> want<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.110> cut<00:02:14.379> out<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.799> neck<00:02:15.040> hole

making<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.739> crescent<00:02:18.280> cut<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> center

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
making a crescent cut to the center

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.809 
making a crescent cut to the center
where<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.319> cut<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.920> top<00:02:21.129> layer<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.640> then<00:02:21.730> I'm

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
where I cut the top layer and then I'm

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.330 
where I cut the top layer and then I'm
folding<00:02:22.299> it<00:02:22.390> over<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.349> make<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.530> exact<00:02:24.160> on

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
folding it over just to make it exact on

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.160 
folding it over just to make it exact on
the<00:02:24.489> other<00:02:24.580> side<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:25.180> then<00:02:25.750> I'm<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:25.930> going

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the other side and then I'm just going

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.670 
the other side and then I'm just going
to<00:02:26.260> use<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.560> kind<00:02:26.799> of<00:02:26.980> as<00:02:27.160> my<00:02:27.720> pattern<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:29.170> cut

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
to use that kind of as my pattern to cut

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.390 
to use that kind of as my pattern to cut
around<00:02:31.620> once<00:02:32.620> you've<00:02:32.769> done<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.280> have

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
around once you've done that you have

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.330 
around once you've done that you have
cut<00:02:33.610> out<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.879> neck<00:02:34.060> hole<00:02:35.099> then<00:02:36.099> you're<00:02:36.220> going

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
cut out the neck hole then you're going

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.920 
cut out the neck hole then you're going
to<00:02:36.400> take<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.000> sewing<00:02:37.180> machine<00:02:37.329> again

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
to take it to the sewing machine again

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.630 
to take it to the sewing machine again
and<00:02:38.200> you're<00:02:38.290> basically<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.860> going<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.340> fold

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and you're basically just going to fold

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.819 
and you're basically just going to fold
over<00:02:40.150> all<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.750> edges<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.379> have<00:02:41.530> cut

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
over all of the edges that you have cut

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.030 
over all of the edges that you have cut
and<00:02:42.510> you're<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.690> want<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.019> run<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> seam

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and you're going to want to run a seam

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.670 
and you're going to want to run a seam
all<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.489> way<00:02:45.849> along<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.840> edge<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.470> fold

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
all the way along the edge just to fold

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.229 
all the way along the edge just to fold
it<00:02:47.829> down<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.310> make<00:02:48.459> sure<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:49.000> nothing

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
it down and to make sure that nothing

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.050 
it down and to make sure that nothing
freeze<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:50.680> your<00:02:50.859> fabric<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.340> delicate<00:02:51.579> like

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
freeze if your fabric is delicate like

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.940 
freeze if your fabric is delicate like
mine<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.690> might<00:02:52.840> bunch<00:02:53.079> up<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.470> little<00:02:53.620> bit<00:02:53.829> when

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
mine it might bunch up a little bit when

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.280 
mine it might bunch up a little bit when
you're<00:02:54.069> sewing<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.879> hold<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.810> top<00:02:56.019> edge

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you're sewing so hold it on the top edge

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.530 
you're sewing so hold it on the top edge
and<00:02:56.319> kind<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.769> pull<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.220> tightly<00:02:57.579> as<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.269> sew

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
and kind of pull it tightly as you sew

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.630 
and kind of pull it tightly as you sew
and<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.049> should<00:02:59.290> prevent<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.769> from<00:02:59.950> doing<00:03:00.280> so

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
and that should prevent it from doing so

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.940 
and that should prevent it from doing so
once<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:01.750> finished<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.620> on<00:03:02.739> all<00:03:02.920> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
once you have finished and so on all of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.120 
once you have finished and so on all of
the<00:03:03.190> edges<00:03:03.340> you're<00:03:03.910> ready<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.450> put<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:05.130> this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
the edges you're ready to put it on this

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.069 
the edges you're ready to put it on this
is<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.670> final<00:03:07.090> thing<00:03:07.359> looks<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:07.870> when

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
is what the final thing looks like when

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.319 
is what the final thing looks like when
you're<00:03:08.230> finished<00:03:08.260> it's<00:03:09.220> nice<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.760> long<00:03:09.970> and
