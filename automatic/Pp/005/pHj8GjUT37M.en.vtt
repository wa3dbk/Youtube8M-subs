00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 save all curtains from spazioogames.it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.049
 we are now doctor white we are here today with 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.940
 a new review of a footballer on 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.220
 first time the latest teams 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 we return for a moment the attackers of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 series after reviewing higuain 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 all right if we start the year 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 our reviews 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.930
 speaking of mario balotelli balotelli 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.640
 which is considered one of the best 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.859
 strikers in series with statistics 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.750
 really really interesting 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.579
 let's see how it behaves 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 in the field starting as always the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.739
 speed speed which is very good 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.570
 obviously not as fast as you but from the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.700
 his has an incredible physique therefore 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 you can safely run him 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.329
 will move opponents reminds me 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.059
 slightly ibra which seems to be stronger 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.070
 physically but is slightly less fast 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 balotelli is a bit of a mix then a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.920
 higher speed than a pound 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.300
 run more fingers slightly lower 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.430
 however it really is really 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.489
 devastating so you can use it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.580
 even for those who love to play at speed 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.090
 shooting shooting is its main quality 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 probably because it's great 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.820
 finalizer this I did not think of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 find a finisher so good but 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 I had to change my mind because it marks 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.600
 really really in all ways of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.280
 left-footed left-wing volley 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 with four weaker stars then 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.830
 you can safely go and shoot 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 with your left-handed then you won't leave 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.369
 landmarks to see that much 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.020
 often the defenders than in sending the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.119
 attackers on the left with balotelli 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 this cannot do it 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.869
 moreover, shooting from outside is also a lot 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 good has excellent shooting power 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.820
 so you have another available 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.530
 weapon against defenses very closed on 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.090
 dribbling is good not good life 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.619
 despite the height 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.320
 what I didn't like about the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.090
 dribbling and the four-star skill that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.399
 they were removed last year he had 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.219
 4 this year have been reduced to three 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.490
 so it's more a dribbling based on 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.110
 acceleration is not bad 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.969
 because anyway I loved it for 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.280
 its height did not hurt sin 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.380
 only for the skis if it wasn't 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.959
 really really devastating blow of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.470
 very good head is very tall balotelli 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.090
 a method 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.950
 9 if I'm not mistaken then you can go 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.500
 quietly to cross and him 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.750
 will also quietly finalize against 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.310
 defenders like chiellini very benatia 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.150
 very good high-headed 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.220
 if you love the game based on the crosses 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.890
 balotelli may be the right choice 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.770
 maybe gomez still slightly better but 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.830
 balotelli is certainly a great one 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.110
 alternative the world race is enough 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.420
 good for a striker because of medium 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.490
 low so it's not perfect is n't the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.860
 classic striker with high bass but 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.170
 however, he will be ready when 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.850
 will serve to conclude the action that is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.030
 mixed you are delivered on balotelli 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.620
 the first is sniper shooting sniper e 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.100
 dribbling so we increased by 3 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.200
 points 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.880
 all the qualities of shooting and dripping 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.160
 let's go further increasing or 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.720
 hawk what I used I speed 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.520
 attire header then let's go to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.950
 further increase his already 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.800
 best statistics where to use 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.540
 mario balotelli in addition to the 4 1 2 1 2 that 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.670
 you saw the video I can open 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.840
 recommend a 5 3 2 with a lot module 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.500
 undervalued because it is offensive 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.060
 you will attach design contacts 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.380
 categorically balotelli is verb like 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.480
 tips and vidal and marchisio as 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.300
 midfielders who run a lot and abbot 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.070
 constant as very high backs that 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.750
 so do the offensive phase then 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.870
 try this module is a lot of fun 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.519
 in the offensive area or in a 3 5 2 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.620
 classic series a 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.269
 gomez balotelli in front so go 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980
 go cross with the exteriors 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.930
 sharaawy squares are very fast 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.170
 they have a great ride can go 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.280
 to cost hernanes is a playmaker 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.239
 incredible because five-star penis 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.250
 weak and one of the best 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.709
 play midfielders and really cultured 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.870
 little becomes very solid classical 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.790
 chiellini benati water jesus speed 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.799
 physical header all that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.690
 you want from three central defenders 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.209
 Balotelli is definitely the best 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.070
 there is a big striker though 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.830
 what's the problem with this player 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.140
 which will sometimes go away completely 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.910
 from the game of san matches like 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.459
 the reality in which he does not 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.380
 will conclude nothing so it will seem to 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.420
 playing in ten is therefore not a 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.709
 constant player and very constant like 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.030
 can be ibrahim indexes because it has 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.739
 I was lucky enough to try the years 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.299
 I saw that all the games were 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.620
 devastating currency 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.360
 but this kind of player is there 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.759
 in the games in which he dominated 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.590
 completely the opponent in others 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.419
 matches in which he will be absent slightly 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.400
 remember though that with a shot of 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.830
 head can safely mark e 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.970
 give you the victory even today 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.349
 concluded if you liked the video 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.090
 at all screams with comments written by 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.139
