00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.670 
I had the idea I had no idea how complex
the<00:01:15.600> idea<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> did<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the idea was going to be when I did it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.719

all the Playstations not PlayStation

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.070 
all the Playstations not PlayStation
Sony<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> play<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.840> where<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Sony but the play you know where you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
Sony but the play you know where you
actually<00:01:25.170> game<00:01:25.470> over<00:01:26.240> remotely<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.450> we

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
actually game over remotely and so we

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually game over remotely and so we
had<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> end<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.140> running<00:01:28.380> about<00:01:28.439> 40<00:01:28.829> feet<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
had to end up running about 40 feet of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
had to end up running about 40 feet of
cable<00:01:29.280> around<00:01:29.700> each<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.090> ended<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.270> being

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
cable around each one it ended up being

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.640 
cable around each one it ended up being
a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.840> expensive<00:01:31.170> than<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.530> thought

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
a little more expensive than I thought

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.690 
a little more expensive than I thought
it<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.130> think<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.490> totally

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it would be but I think it's totally

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
it would be but I think it's totally
worth<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.110> fun<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
worth it just because it was fun and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.190 
worth it just because it was fun and

it's<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:19.770> okay<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.160> spent<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.580> stupid<00:03:20.760> amount

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
it's just okay you spent a stupid amount

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's just okay you spent a stupid amount
of<00:03:21.180> money<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.540> threw<00:03:21.750> everything<00:03:21.989> in

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
of money and you threw everything in

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.810 
of money and you threw everything in
there<00:03:22.320> because<00:03:22.560> as<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.830> know<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.459> don't<00:03:23.610> need

settings<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:30.750> went<00:03:31.050> for<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> gaming<00:03:31.500> pc

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
settings so we went for a gaming pc

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.830 
settings so we went for a gaming pc
those<00:03:32.000> absolutely<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.150> top<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.660> line

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
those absolutely like top of the line

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.090 
those absolutely like top of the line
without<00:03:34.050> being<00:03:34.230> without<00:03:34.650> being<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:34.980> an

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
overkill machine so of course

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.990 
overkill machine so of course
cornerstone<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.860> any<00:03:38.010> gaming<00:03:38.340> machine<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.730> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
cornerstone of any gaming machine is the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.050 
cornerstone of any gaming machine is the
graphics<00:03:39.360> card<00:03:39.540> we're<00:03:39.840> rocking<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.230> GTX<00:03:41.220> 780

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
graphics card we're rocking the GTX 780

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.750 
graphics card we're rocking the GTX 780
which<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.709> my<00:03:43.860> might<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.040> mean<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.310> Titan<00:03:44.610> is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
which is in my might I mean the Titan is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.580 
which is in my might I mean the Titan is
marginally<00:03:45.570> faster<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.350> came<00:03:46.440> out

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
marginally faster but it came out

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.440 
marginally faster but it came out
earlier<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.370> costs<00:03:47.700> like<00:03:47.820> twice<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.330> much

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
earlier and it costs like twice as much

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.380 
earlier and it costs like twice as much
so<00:03:48.660> right<00:03:48.780> now<00:03:48.900> GTX<00:03:49.410> 780<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:51.150> best

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
so right now GTX 780 is the best

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.670 
so right now GTX 780 is the best
graphics<00:03:51.780> card<00:03:51.900> for<00:03:52.020> us<00:03:52.110> especially<00:03:52.470> since<00:03:52.590> we

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
do CG stuff which requires Nvidia

do CG stuff which requires Nvidia

for<00:04:02.730> your<00:04:02.970> buck<00:04:03.150> processor<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:03.900> pretty<00:04:04.110> much

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
for your buck processor it's pretty much

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
see like these ridiculous the ridiculous

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.440 
see like these ridiculous the ridiculous
ones<00:04:11.430> which<00:04:11.580> are<00:04:11.700> super<00:04:11.880> expensive<00:04:12.150> like

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
ones which are super expensive like

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.270 
ones which are super expensive like
$2,000<00:04:13.140> each<00:04:13.260> it'll<00:04:13.769> come<00:04:13.920> down<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.190> then

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
$2,000 each it'll come down and then

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.440 
$2,000 each it'll come down and then
right<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:14.519> it's<00:04:14.640> like<00:04:14.700> magic<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> little<00:04:15.269> spot

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
right in it's like magic a little spot

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.060 
right in it's like magic a little spot
about<00:04:15.660> five<00:04:15.870> notches<00:04:16.049> from<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.380> top<00:04:16.560> there's

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
about five notches from the top there's

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.340 
about five notches from the top there's
the<00:04:17.130> four<00:04:17.310> 770<00:04:17.850> K<00:04:18.000> at<00:04:18.480> like<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.810> stupidly<00:04:19.169> low

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
the four 770 K at like the stupidly low

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.860 
the four 770 K at like the stupidly low
price<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.650> $300<00:04:20.609> for<00:04:21.060> for<00:04:21.540> what<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.750> does

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
price of $300 for for what it does

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.240 
price of $300 for for what it does
performance<00:04:22.260> wise<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.470> clock<00:04:22.919> right<00:04:23.039> now<00:04:23.190> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
performance wise the clock right now to

performance wise the clock right now to
4.3<00:04:23.820> gigahertz<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.690> they'll<00:04:24.930> they'll<00:04:25.350> be<00:04:25.440> able

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
4.3 gigahertz so they'll they'll be able

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.680 
4.3 gigahertz so they'll they'll be able
to<00:04:25.590> churn<00:04:25.740> through<00:04:25.919> anything<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.760> then

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
to churn through anything and then

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.060 
to churn through anything and then
we<00:04:28.020> found<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.260> be<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.440> one<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.710> awesomest

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
we found to be like one of the awesomest

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.310 
we found to be like one of the awesomest
things<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:29.670> for<00:04:30.000> gaming<00:04:30.300> right<00:04:30.390> now<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.750> we're

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
things for for gaming right now is we're

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.490 
things for for gaming right now is we're
doing<00:04:31.410> rated<00:04:31.890> rated<00:04:32.280> SSDs<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.660> 120

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
doing rated rated SSDs we have to 120

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.290 
but origin actually went the extra mile
and<00:05:04.280> did<00:05:05.280> everything<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.880> course<00:05:06.060> it's<00:05:06.210> a

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
and did everything and of course it's a

it's<00:05:16.530> like<00:05:16.620> what<00:05:16.770> can<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:16.980> run<00:05:17.070> Crysis<00:05:17.460> at<00:05:17.610> for

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
it's like what can it run Crysis at for

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.010

one's can really agree on what the best
like<00:05:26.730> benchmark<00:05:27.120> game<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.390> and<00:05:27.540> when<00:05:27.630> they<00:05:27.720> do

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
like benchmark game is and when they do

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.690 
like benchmark game is and when they do
it's<00:05:28.080> only<00:05:28.200> for<00:05:28.350> six<00:05:28.380> months<00:05:28.680> but<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.830> think<00:05:29.130> the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
it's only for six months but I think the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.830
