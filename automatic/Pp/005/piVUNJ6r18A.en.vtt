00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.410
 welcome to 365 deco weavers today les 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.570
 I bring this idea of ​​how to make small 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.599
 little hearts with clips you will need 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.599
 crochet needle clips scissors and thread 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.300
 I have this big clip you can also 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.570
 use the smallest does not matter 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.810
 you are going to calculate half of your clip 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 in the middle you will be pressing with the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 index finger 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.340
 downwards so that the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.340
 heart 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.880
 now you have to make sure that when 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.770
 you are forming the heart the tips of 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.580
 clip left in the back 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.380
 the two together that have the one that has 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.380
 click have to be left behind 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.480
 and the big wire that forms the heart 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.600
 it has to be on the side of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600
 in front 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.080
 so that you can weave it and also 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 you can put it in the paper 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.970
 when you use it in this way it's going to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.640
 stay 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.580
 heart is going to be in front of you and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.160
 clips or pieces of wire shaped 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.470
 de cruz will be left behind 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.540
 I'm going to use this needle number now 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.510
 you can use whatever you want or the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.180
 what they like or what they have 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.720
 they also just have to notice that 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.920
 the needle grasps the thread well and that's 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.870
 everything I'm going to use this thin thread you're going to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.870
 form a ring with the thread 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.060
 This way you will have the ring 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.060
 now you take your clip 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.540
 they realize that the shape of the heart 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 stay ahead you're going to turn around and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.569
 let's start from this side to be able 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.300
 start knitting 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.880
 put the needle down 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 clip 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.530
 you hold the thread with the crochet hook 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.140
 let's go hiding this piece of and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.890
 what remains there we will go 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.890
 hiding 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.700
 to line the little heart made with 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.620
 this clip we are only going to need 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.300
 make low points 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.230
 you put the needle down 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.230
 plazas 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.750
 you have to make sure you 're grabbing 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.690
 the thread that you have left to go 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.600
 hiding together with the wire of 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.870
 clip 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:04.190
 you put the needles back in the loop 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.260
 and you take those are low points 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.170
 let's keep knitting now you have to 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.260
 push down the tissue 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 so that it stops in that corner and you go to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.040
 continue weaving 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.690
 when you get to this part it's a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.850
 a little annoying to weave because they get in the way 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.920
 bit 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.080
 this part is not going to be very complicated 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.020
 for those who already have experience in 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.100
 tissue but yes for the one that is going to 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.740
 try for the first time but it's not so 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.050
 complicated you just have to have a 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.990
 little bit of patience and you'll see how you 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.990
 it comes out and it will be nice 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.720
 you have to knit always on the part of 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.510
 down without grasping those wires or spikes 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.680
 that come out the back when 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.230
 already finished is to keep pulling 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.439
 down to go together and so stay 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.980
 Very well woven wire and do not remain 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.530
 pieces without knitting you have to follow 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.180
 squeezing the tissue 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:21.040
 at the end simply ends in this 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.730
 part of the needle in the center 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.070
 a first stitch that you made jalas since 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.700
 you have your weaved heart now I 'm going to 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.800
 teach how to weave this other heart with 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.510
 pearls you can cover everything with 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.340
 pearls or only I'm going to put 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.680
 only 2 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.230
 you are going to put the basin or pearl in the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.920
 I'm going to put 2 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.400
 You will knit as I indicated at the beginning 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.400
 of the video 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.569
 now that you get to this part you have 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.770
 that poke the needle underneath 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.770
 do the lacing 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.580
 put the basin or the perlite well attached 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.379
 to the clip wire 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.379
 then do the loop 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.530
 it's very simple then you keep knitting 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.880
 as we have been doing previously 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.430
 making the low points 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.190
 there you have the little stone stuck now 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.960
 keep knitting until you reach the end 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.820
 put the needle in the back 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.820
 you make the last point to finish 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.569
 then later you hit the pebble that 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.569
 we have 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.920
 lower it and paste it very well 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.800
 try to make it well attached to the fabric 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.420
 tie him in this way again 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.420
 another chain to finish 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:59.250
 and your heart is finished 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.640
 only cuts with the scissor hides the 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.640
 thread 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.800
 you can use your heart 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.490
 wherever you want 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.280
 I put them in these additional books 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.400
 that I have to go marking where I 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.400
 I really like how they are 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.960
 I hope you liked this tutorial and 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.820
 enjoy making them when you put it 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.680
 on paper or on the sheets you will 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.760
 remain in this way in the part of 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.710
 behind 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.320
 now you can surprise your friends 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.740
 from school with these hearts made 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.960
 with a clip you made 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.330
 in the next tutorial I want to teach you 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.919
 to make these little butterflies or mini 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.960
 butterflies so you can decorate your 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.960
 clips see you next time
