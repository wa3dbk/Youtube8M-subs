Fidel Castro and this will be in this

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.670 
Fidel Castro and this will be in this
case<00:00:21.630> will<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.870> a<00:00:22.050> tip<00:00:22.620> from<00:00:22.830> JFK<00:00:23.870> so<00:00:24.870> you<00:00:25.500> can

case will be a tip from JFK so you can

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.590 
case will be a tip from JFK so you can
choose<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.850> clip<00:00:27.840> will<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:29.600> moved<00:00:30.600> to

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
choose that that clip will be moved to

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.380 
choose that that clip will be moved to
the<00:00:31.140> main<00:00:31.410> timeline<00:00:31.770> so<00:00:32.129> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.700> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the main timeline so you can see this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.489 
the main timeline so you can see this
video<00:00:33.839> and<00:00:35.510> after<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.629> business<00:00:36.960> being<00:00:37.289> play

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
video and after the business being play

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:38.810 
video and after the business being play
right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.280> example<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
right now so for example you have a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.849 
right now so for example you have a
topic<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> perspective<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
topic that you have the perspective of

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.099 
topic that you have the perspective of
Fidel<00:00:41.190> Castro<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.570> move<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
Fidel Castro and then you can move and

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.020 
Fidel Castro and then you can move and
see<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.859> video<00:00:44.129> from<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> other<00:00:44.519> commenters

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
see the video from the other commenters

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.329 
see the video from the other commenters
to<00:00:45.179> see<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> perspective<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> idea<00:00:47.190> here

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
to see that perspective so the idea here

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.680 
to see that perspective so the idea here
is<00:00:47.609> that<00:00:47.699> you're<00:00:47.879> watching<00:00:48.089> something<00:00:48.449> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
is that you're watching something is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.689 
is that you're watching something is
like<00:00:48.839> going<00:00:49.019> to<00:00:49.230> Wikipedia<00:00:49.769> so<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.339> you're

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
like going to Wikipedia so you're you're

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.549 
like going to Wikipedia so you're you're
reading<00:00:51.089> a<00:00:51.179> story<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.929> then<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.530> go

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
reading a story and then you can go

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.399 
reading a story and then you can go
deeper<00:00:53.129> into<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:54.210> topic<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> specific<00:00:55.229> topic

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
deeper into one topic a specific topic

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.139 
deeper into one topic a specific topic
and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:55.769> go<00:00:56.010> back<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.640> main<00:00:56.819> timeline

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and then go back to the main timeline

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
and then go back to the main timeline
that's<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.069> other<00:00:59.190> thing<00:00:59.249> is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that's one thing and the other thing is

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.219 
that's one thing and the other thing is
that<00:00:59.639> if<00:00:59.819> you<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.389> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.749> say<00:01:00.929> well<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
that if you want you can say well I

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.349 
that if you want you can say well I
don't<00:01:01.679> want<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.339> watch<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.969> document

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
don't want just to watch this document

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.410 
don't want just to watch this document
they<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.899> completely<00:01:04.710> switch<00:01:05.070> focus<00:01:05.729> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
they want to completely switch focus so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
they want to completely switch focus so
we're<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> turn<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.100> minute

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we're going to turn it and the minute

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
we're going to turn it and the minute
that<00:01:08.399> you<00:01:08.520> turn<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.990> main

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that you turn it actually the main

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.420 
that you turn it actually the main
timeline<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:11.700> becomes<00:01:12.509> that<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
timeline it becomes that the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.080 
timeline it becomes that the
intersections<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.909> intersection

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
intersections and the intersection

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
intersections and the intersection
become<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.110> main<00:01:16.290> timeline<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.490> main

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
become the main timeline so now the main

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
become the main timeline so now the main
timeline<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.259> JFK<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.469> JFK<00:01:19.860> documentary

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
timeline will be JFK the JFK documentary

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.590 
timeline will be JFK the JFK documentary
so<00:01:20.969> you<00:01:21.030> keep<00:01:21.630> watching<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:23.450> until<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so you keep watching that one until you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
so you keep watching that one until you
want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.140> either<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.469> other<00:01:25.860> other

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
want to see either the other other

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.279 
want to see either the other other
intersection<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.880> other<00:01:27.119> documentaries<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
intersection of other documentaries you

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.830 
intersection of other documentaries you
will<00:01:28.469> use<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.000> affordances<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.509> medium

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
will use the affordances of the medium

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.200 
will use the affordances of the medium
so<00:01:31.289> one<00:01:31.649> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.859> things<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.340> course<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so one of the things is of course you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
so one of the things is of course you
have<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.479> gestures<00:01:33.899> in<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.259> case<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
have the gestures in this case so you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
have the gestures in this case so you
can<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.609> go<00:01:35.820> back<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.149> forth<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.719> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
can you can go back and forth with the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.529 
can you can go back and forth with the
with<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:37.710> timeline<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.270> click

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
with with a timeline and you can click

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.200 
with with a timeline and you can click
on<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.950> different<00:01:41.369> intersection<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
on it on the different intersection that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.800 
on it on the different intersection that
come<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> screen<00:01:44.240> because<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.420> want<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
come on the screen because we want to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.149 
come on the screen because we want to
use<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.500> screen<00:01:47.039> as<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:48.320> control<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.829> it's
