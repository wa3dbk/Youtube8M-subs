00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
now and basically guys this farm is

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
now and basically guys this farm is
extremely<00:00:31.109> easy<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.439> make<00:00:31.560> very<00:00:32.099> compact<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
extremely easy to make very compact and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.560 
extremely easy to make very compact and
is<00:00:33.420> insanely<00:00:34.170> efficient<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.420> you're

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
is insanely efficient now all you're

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590 
is insanely efficient now all you're
gonna<00:00:36.660> need<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.530> farm<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.059> about<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> nine

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
gonna need for this farm is about a nine

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680 
gonna need for this farm is about a nine
by<00:00:39.840> six<00:00:39.870> plot<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> land<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.760> bunch<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> assorted

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
by six plot of land a bunch of assorted

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.590 
by six plot of land a bunch of assorted
tools<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.379> usual<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:44.579> ladders<00:00:44.969> two

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
tools just like usual two ladders two

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.880 
tools just like usual two ladders two
signs<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.750> necessarily<00:00:49.649> but

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
signs you don't need so necessarily but

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
signs you don't need so necessarily but
I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> makes<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> design<00:00:50.820> look<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> whole

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I think it makes the design look a whole

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.260 
I think it makes the design look a whole
heap<00:00:51.570> cleaner<00:00:51.960> definitely<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.039> dirt<00:00:53.340> an

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
heap cleaner definitely some dirt an

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810 
heap cleaner definitely some dirt an
easy<00:00:54.600> block<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.230> break<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> could<00:00:56.610> just

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
easy block to break so you could just

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.860 
easy block to break so you could just
use<00:00:57.000> dirt<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> use<00:00:58.379> netherrack

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
use dirt but I like to use netherrack

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.720 
use dirt but I like to use netherrack

mark out a four by four area with dirt
so<00:01:11.280> basically<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> say<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> mean<00:01:12.900> you

want four by four of grafts with a dirt

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.690 
want four by four of grafts with a dirt
border<00:01:18.390> around<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.960> now<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> way<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.130> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
border around it now the way I do this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
border around it now the way I do this
is<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.060> normally<00:01:21.390> place<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:22.350> first<00:01:22.560> block

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is like normally place my first block

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.320 
is like normally place my first block
and<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> count<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.030> two<00:01:24.299> three<00:01:25.280> four<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> then

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and a count one two three four and then

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
and a count one two three four and then
one<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.130> those<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.490> our<00:01:29.579> three

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
one more and so those are our three

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.469 
one more and so those are our three
corners<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.009> then<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.090> quite

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
corners and then from those it's quite

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
corners and then from those it's quite
easy<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.409> gauge<00:01:34.680> where<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> other<00:01:35.490> two

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
easy to gauge where the other two

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
easy to gauge where the other two
corners<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.780> however<00:01:37.320> works<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
corners are but however works for you

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.640 
corners are but however works for you
that'll<00:01:38.400> that'll<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.790> fine<00:01:39.110> now<00:01:40.110> once<00:01:40.470> you've

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that'll that'll be fine now once you've

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
that'll that'll be fine now once you've
marked<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.729> corners<00:01:42.090> guys<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.630> can

where it's recessed a little bit now in

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.620 
where it's recessed a little bit now in
the<00:02:04.439> back<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> similar<00:02:05.880> sort<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.360> thing

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the back you do a similar sort of thing

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
the back you do a similar sort of thing
only<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.950> doing<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
only we're going to be doing it on the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.400 
only we're going to be doing it on the
outside<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.750> assess<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> by<00:02:10.349> two

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
outside here and your assess it by two

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.910 
outside here and your assess it by two
blocks<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
blocks so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.220 
blocks so
-<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.440> that's<00:02:14.440> where<00:02:15.300> your<00:02:16.300> wall<00:02:16.510> would<00:02:16.900> go<00:02:17.170> -

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
- and that's where your wall would go -

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.890 
- and that's where your wall would go -
and<00:02:17.650> then<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> exact<00:02:19.450> same<00:02:19.540> thing

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
and then just do the exact same thing

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.470 
and then just do the exact same thing
for<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> opposite<00:02:20.440> side<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.220> -<00:02:21.790> then

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
for the opposite side so one - then

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.400 
for the opposite side so one - then
that's<00:02:22.630> where<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.020> wall<00:02:23.200> would<00:02:23.920> would<00:02:24.580> end

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
that's where the wall would would end

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.680 
that's where the wall would would end
just<00:02:26.410> like<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:27.150> alright<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.330> now<00:02:28.420> once<00:02:28.570> we've

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
just like that alright so now once we've

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.120 
just like that alright so now once we've
got<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.959> guy's<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.500> we're<00:02:29.590> gonna<00:02:29.680> do<00:02:29.920> is

signs<00:03:58.739> side<00:03:59.739> by<00:03:59.920> side<00:04:00.190> there<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:01.200> that's

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
signs side by side there and that's

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.539 
signs side by side there and that's
basically<00:04:02.560> going<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.980> be<00:04:03.040> where<00:04:03.370> our

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
basically going to be where our

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.729 
basically going to be where our
collection<00:04:04.180> water<00:04:04.390> will<00:04:04.570> push<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.290> then

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
collection water will push to and then

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.930 
collection water will push to and then
I'll<00:04:05.829> stop<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.190> collection<00:04:06.430> water<00:04:06.760> from

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
falling down and flooding us in here but

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.699 
falling down and flooding us in here but
it'll<00:04:09.400> allow<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:10.019> items<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.170> stuff<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.500> fall

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
it'll allow the items and stuff to fall

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.670 
it'll allow the items and stuff to fall
