00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.880
 now guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:12.250
 tell them how to clean your aquarium and how 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.460
 clean your turtles 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.710
 good 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.830
 as you can see I already change the water 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 to mine already because I went ahead because it's going to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.500
 do a lot of video already but if I'm going to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.500
 show how to clean our turtles 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.340
 well I the dirty water I have done to 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.290
 this bucket already 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.750
 here are all the things that is the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.170
 Heater filter if they take out 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.269
 here are the covers already 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 and here is the food that I already have that 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.899
 go to meet them 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 well let's continue with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.960
 put the filter to the heater and those 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.710
 things already good 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 is going to be a dressing and we continue 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.379
 and it has arrived we remove with the filter 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.379
 here 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.530
 is out of here 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530
 with Chile 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.860
 and nothing 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.909
 we put plugged in as anything 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.370
 that ends in masters 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.700
 but that I have to look for him 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:42.620
 plug that is around here so I have 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.340
 than to look for an annual white appointment with the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.340
 water heater 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:54.310
 and I found what I found here he plugged it in 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 triple because he put three already and he has 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 fact 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.110
 come 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 then he started throwing a cartoon 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.600
 solid already so 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.880
 in the heater 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 we put it the same 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.659
 already 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.659
 with 16 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.250
 If we do not wet our hands, I know it will be because 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.250
 can give them the current already dry 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.890
 there is no 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.890
 it has done 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.800
 but I hope not 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 it does not have to be triple because it does not 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920
 I come back 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.490
 and it's not already 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.770
 we are going to 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.770
 I'll pause 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.950

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.180

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.180
 the best of the soil 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.209
 do not forget to wash the place where 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:25.049

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.049

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.080
 and wash well with the water and 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.080
 grab a brush 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.069
 or anything that they no longer occupy but 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:47.219

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.830

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:05.590
