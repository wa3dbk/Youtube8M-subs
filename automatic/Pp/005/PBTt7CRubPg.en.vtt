00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:01.660 
picked me because even though who I was
but<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:57.989> I've<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.160> some<00:01:59.429> some<00:02:00.090> notoriety

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670

but now I've got some some notoriety
so<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.849> instrumental<00:02:03.179> has<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.599> house<00:02:03.780> been

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
so how instrumental has the house been

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.419 
so how instrumental has the house been
in<00:02:04.319> training<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.890> aren't<00:02:05.069> training<00:02:05.310> in

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
in training where you aren't training in

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.830 
in training where you aren't training in
the<00:02:05.489> house<00:02:05.640> before<00:02:05.879> the<00:02:06.090> arena<00:02:06.390> correct<00:02:06.720> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the house before the arena correct you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.169 
the house before the arena correct you
moved<00:02:07.050> in<00:02:07.229> shortly<00:02:07.679> after<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.369> moved<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.970> one

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
moved in shortly after I moved in one

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.660 
moved in shortly after I moved in one
week<00:02:09.330> before<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:11.099> helped<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.430> bit

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
week before so it helped a little bit

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.369 
week before so it helped a little bit
but<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.060> wasn't<00:02:12.390> definitely<00:02:12.900> wasn't<00:02:13.170> at<00:02:13.230> full

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
but it wasn't definitely wasn't at full

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.050 
but it wasn't definitely wasn't at full
potential<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> house<00:02:14.849> she<00:02:14.970> had

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
potential from like the house she had

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.970 
potential from like the house she had
and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> saw<00:02:15.390> him<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.959> still<00:02:16.230> definitely<00:02:16.739> need<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and I saw him I still definitely need to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280 
and I saw him I still definitely need to
work<00:02:17.099> more<00:02:17.879> at<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> house<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.110> think

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
work more at the house and I think

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.600 
work more at the house and I think
Dallas<00:02:19.590> will<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> much<00:02:20.040> better<00:02:20.160> indicator

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
Dallas will be a much better indicator

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.240 
Dallas will be a much better indicator
of<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:20.879> much<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.150> helps<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:22.129> having<00:02:23.129> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
of how much it helps but having a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
of how much it helps but having a
consistent<00:02:23.519> practice<00:02:23.849> schedule<00:02:24.450> is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
consistent practice schedule is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.000 
consistent practice schedule is
something<00:02:24.900> I've<00:02:25.110> never<00:02:25.200> had<00:02:25.410> before<00:02:25.470> with

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
something I've never had before with

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.450 
something I've never had before with
school<00:02:26.250> ones<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.840> living<00:02:28.080> at<00:02:28.170> home<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.070> this

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
school ones just living at home so this

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.790 
school ones just living at home so this
it<00:02:30.300> was<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.630> much<00:02:30.750> better<00:02:30.900> than

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
it was so much better than

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.980 
it was so much better than
I<00:02:31.830> usually<00:02:32.250> am<00:02:32.340> used<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.660> feel<00:02:33.840> like

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that that practice really helped train

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.380 
that that practice really helped train

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
regular grind it's just gonna be

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.450 
regular grind it's just gonna be
complete<00:03:09.270> practice<00:03:09.660> until<00:03:10.080> Dallas<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.220> then

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
hopefully I qualify for IPL as well so

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.530 
hopefully I qualify for IPL as well so
maybe<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.070> go<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.250> IPL<00:03:14.580> first<00:03:14.820> because<00:03:15.480> I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
maybe I can go to IPL first because I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.850 
maybe I can go to IPL first because I
think<00:03:15.690> that's<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.050> think<00:03:16.080> that's<00:03:16.230> before<00:03:16.620> is

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860
