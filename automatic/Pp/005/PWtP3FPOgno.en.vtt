destroying the city blowing things up

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.380 
destroying the city blowing things up
very<00:00:56.129> much<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.430> hold<00:00:56.670> ultimate<00:00:57.030> destruction

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
very much like hold ultimate destruction

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.290 
very much like hold ultimate destruction
and<00:00:57.750> other<00:00:58.230> games<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.800> ilk

and other games of that ilk

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.160 
and other games of that ilk
unfortunately<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> problem<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
unfortunately what the problem is is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650 
unfortunately what the problem is is
that<00:01:01.640> transformers<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.300> open-world

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

that transformers as for an open-world
game<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.259> really<00:01:04.470> fully<00:01:04.619> realized<00:01:05.190> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
game is not really fully realized you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.100 
game is not really fully realized you
spend<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.390> time<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.840> around

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
spend a lot of your time going around

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.930 
spend a lot of your time going around
from<00:01:07.350> mission<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.649> Mission<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.759> point

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
from mission to Mission point the point

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.550 
from mission to Mission point the point
was<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.509> to<00:01:09.690> do<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.869> between<00:01:10.289> other

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
was really little to do in between other

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.190 
was really little to do in between other
than<00:01:10.710> grab<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.340> obvious<00:01:11.759> power-ups<00:01:12.390> because

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
than grab very obvious power-ups because

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.779 
than grab very obvious power-ups because
of<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.410> linear<00:01:13.740> structure<00:01:14.160> was<00:01:14.340> supposed<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
of this linear structure was supposed to

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.550 
of this linear structure was supposed to
be<00:01:14.850> an<00:01:14.940> open-world<00:01:15.360> things<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.200> tedious

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
be an open-world things get tedious

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
be an open-world things get tedious
really<00:01:17.009> quickly<00:01:17.399> we're<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.090> most<00:01:18.300> games<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
really quickly we're in most games of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
really quickly we're in most games of
this<00:01:19.229> type<00:01:19.289> you<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.649> six<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.640> seven

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this type you have six or seven

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.100 
this type you have six or seven
different<00:01:21.090> things<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.599> do<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:21.929> one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
different things you can do at any one

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
different things you can do at any one
time<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.099> pretty<00:01:23.310> much<00:01:23.399> collect

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
time this is pretty much collect

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.880 
time this is pretty much collect
whatever<00:01:24.090> your<00:01:24.360> mission<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> next

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
whatever your mission is go to the next

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.550 
whatever your mission is go to the next
one<00:01:26.009> perform<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.819> repeat<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:28.319> a<00:01:28.380> game

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
one perform it and repeat and in a game

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.600 
one perform it and repeat and in a game
like<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.250> supposed<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.550> be

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
like this where you're supposed to be

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
like this where you're supposed to be
this<00:01:29.759> all-powerful<00:01:30.119> robot<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.899> you're<00:01:30.990> only

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
this all-powerful robot and you're only

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.930 
this all-powerful robot and you're only
doing<00:01:31.349> the<00:01:31.590> same<00:01:31.770> two<00:01:32.039> or<00:01:32.190> three<00:01:32.399> things<00:01:32.580> over

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
doing the same two or three things over

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.809 
doing the same two or three things over
and<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.119> again<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.780> gets<00:01:33.959> really<00:01:34.080> old<00:01:34.229> fast

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
and over again it gets really old fast

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.949 
and over again it gets really old fast
so<00:01:35.819> what<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> you're<00:01:36.330> doing<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
so what is it that you're doing over and

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.389 
so what is it that you're doing over and
over<00:01:37.050> again<00:01:37.229> well<00:01:37.530> basically<00:01:37.830> there's<00:01:38.099> three

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
over again well basically there's three

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.030 
over again well basically there's three
different<00:01:38.520> types<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:39.090> missions

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
different types of missions

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.770 
different types of missions
the<00:01:40.580> first<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.940> your<00:01:41.060> standard<00:01:41.360> race<00:01:41.540> type

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
the first is your standard race type

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.030 
the first is your standard race type
which<00:01:41.960> basically<00:01:42.200> moves<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.590> from<00:01:42.710> point<00:01:42.950> to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
which basically moves you from point to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.350 
which basically moves you from point to
point<00:01:43.130> going<00:01:43.640> from<00:01:43.850> checkpoint<00:01:44.090> to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
point going from checkpoint to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.420 
point going from checkpoint to
checkpoint<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.860> know<00:01:45.950> that's<00:01:46.130> really

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
checkpoint and you know that's really

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.250 
checkpoint and you know that's really
standard<00:01:46.820> stuff<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.210> reminds<00:01:47.420> us<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.660> burnout

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
standard stuff it reminds us of burnout

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.410 
standard stuff it reminds us of burnout
in<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.410> way<00:01:48.530> only<00:01:48.680> not<00:01:49.100> as<00:01:49.220> pretty<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:50.060> second

in a way only not as pretty the second

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.090 
in a way only not as pretty the second
thing<00:01:50.510> you<00:01:50.570> could<00:01:50.750> do<00:01:50.870> is<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:51.230> arrive<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.740> an

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
thing you could do is you arrive in an

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.650 
thing you could do is you arrive in an
arena<00:01:52.340> type<00:01:52.670> environment<00:01:53.180> where<00:01:53.300> it's<00:01:53.420> your

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
arena type environment where it's your

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.420 
arena type environment where it's your
giant<00:01:54.110> transform<00:01:54.590> robot<00:01:54.920> against<00:01:55.160> another

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
giant transform robot against another

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.520 
giant transform robot against another
horde<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.210> giant<00:01:56.570> transformed<00:01:57.020> robots<00:01:57.320> and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
horde of giant transformed robots and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.500 
horde of giant transformed robots and
you<00:01:58.130> basically<00:01:58.280> fight<00:01:58.700> them<00:01:58.880> until<00:01:59.030> all<00:01:59.479> of

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
you basically fight them until all of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.330 
you basically fight them until all of
them<00:01:59.720> are<00:01:59.810> gone<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.710> final<00:02:00.920> type<00:02:01.190> of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
them are gone then the final type of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.650 
them are gone then the final type of
thing<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.580> have<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.729> do<00:02:01.910> is<00:02:02.120> a<00:02:02.150> mix<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.630> two

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
thing you have to do is a mix of the two

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.590 
thing you have to do is a mix of the two
so<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.500> either<00:02:03.770> transforming<00:02:04.729> into<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.300> car

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
so you either transforming into a car

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.910 
so you either transforming into a car
and<00:02:05.720> going<00:02:05.840> from<00:02:05.990> point<00:02:06.200> A<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.380> point<00:02:06.500> B<00:02:06.710> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
and going from point A to point B and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.320 
and going from point A to point B and
then<00:02:07.010> fighting<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.460> horde<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.729> robots<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.240> then

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
then fighting a horde of robots and then

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.300 
then fighting a horde of robots and then
repeating<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:09.350> really<00:02:09.619> all<00:02:09.770> there<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:09.979> to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
repeating it's really all there is to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.310 
repeating it's really all there is to
the<00:02:10.490> entire<00:02:10.759> transformers<00:02:11.480> gameplay<00:02:11.870> formula

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the entire transformers gameplay formula

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.990 
the entire transformers gameplay formula
and<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:12.890> tell<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.220> flexibility<00:02:13.850> is

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
and as you can tell the flexibility is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.210 
and as you can tell the flexibility is
really<00:02:14.240> limited<00:02:14.500> perhaps<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.620> most<00:02:15.740> amazing

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
really limited perhaps the most amazing

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.740 
really limited perhaps the most amazing
thing<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.550> how<00:02:16.730> transformers<00:02:17.300> works<00:02:17.510> is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
thing about how transformers works is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.960 
thing about how transformers works is
the<00:02:18.470> best<00:02:18.680> part<00:02:18.890> about<00:02:18.950> being<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.370> transformers

the best part about being a transformers
you<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.180> all<00:02:20.330> these<00:02:20.450> badass<00:02:20.900> guns<00:02:21.230> and

at a drone or another low-level enemy
it's<00:02:29.750> very<00:02:29.900> inaccurate<00:02:30.260> does<00:02:30.650> very<00:02:30.920> little

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it's very inaccurate does very little

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.500 
it's very inaccurate does very little
damage<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.760> by<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.910> time<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.270> get<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
damage and by the time you get to the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.390 
damage and by the time you get to the
mid-level<00:02:33.050> bosses<00:02:33.410> are<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.590> actual<00:02:33.950> really

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
mid-level bosses are the actual really

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.580 
mid-level bosses are the actual really
tough<00:02:34.610> guys<00:02:34.880> all<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.780> them<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.020> shields<00:02:36.470> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
tough guys all of them have shields and

tough guys all of them have shields and
the<00:02:36.650> guns<00:02:36.830> are<00:02:37.040> absolutely<00:02:37.550> useless<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.030> you

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
the guns are absolutely useless so you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.850 
the guns are absolutely useless so you
have<00:02:38.209> actually<00:02:38.600> no<00:02:38.930> reason<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.530> use<00:02:39.709> them

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
have actually no reason to use them

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.380 
have actually no reason to use them
whatsoever<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.730> means<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.120> basically

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
whatsoever this means that you basically

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.150 
whatsoever this means that you basically
boils<00:02:41.720> down<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.110> brawling<00:02:42.680> match<00:02:42.830> where<00:02:43.100> it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
boils down to a brawling match where it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.520 
boils down to a brawling match where it
says<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.459> vs<00:02:43.820> them<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.720> fist<00:02:44.959> versus<00:02:45.290> fist

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
says you vs them in a fist versus fist

one or two jump moves that again gets

one or two jump moves that again gets
very<00:02:50.840> cold<00:02:51.080> very<00:02:51.410> quickly<00:02:51.830> which<00:02:52.190> seems<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.459> be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
very cold very quickly which seems to be

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.150 
very cold very quickly which seems to be
the<00:02:52.670> ongoing<00:02:53.120> theme<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.780> game<00:02:53.959> if<00:02:54.920> there

the ongoing theme of the game if there

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.699 
the ongoing theme of the game if there
is<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.510> silver<00:02:56.510> lining<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:57.049> every<00:02:57.230> cloud<00:02:57.260> I'd

is a silver lining in every cloud I'd

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.590 
is a silver lining in every cloud I'd
say<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.190> Decepticons<00:02:58.940> are<00:02:59.090> actually<00:02:59.390> more

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
say the Decepticons are actually more

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.810

fun<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.049> use<00:03:00.230> than<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.560> Autobots<00:03:01.100> at<00:03:01.640> least

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
fun to use than the Autobots at least

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.100 
fun to use than the Autobots at least
when<00:03:01.970> you're<00:03:02.060> playing<00:03:02.120> as<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.480> Decepticons
