now over here we just we chopped up one
small<00:00:55.649> onion<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> was

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
small onion the as you can see it was

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.680 
small onion the as you can see it was
pretty<00:00:57.930> small<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.440> also<00:00:58.559> did<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> very

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
pretty small but we also did it very

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.130 
pretty small but we also did it very
very<00:01:00.690> small<00:01:00.960> almost<00:01:01.170> minced<00:01:02.629> that's<00:01:03.629> really

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
very small almost minced that's really

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
very small almost minced that's really

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
small so you don't big chunks of onion

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.880 
small so you don't big chunks of onion
in<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
in it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
in it
so<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> go<00:01:08.250> ahead<00:01:08.689> it's<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so I'm going to go ahead it's going to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
so I'm going to go ahead it's going to
put<00:01:10.140> our<00:01:10.320> garlic<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.760> cloves

long either
so<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:05.420> about<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.600> minute<00:02:05.810> or<00:02:06.050> two<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:07.700> took

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
so just about a minute or two that took

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.680 
so just about a minute or two that took
about<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.660> minute<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.380> even<00:02:10.390> having<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.450> pan<00:02:11.660> on

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690

about a minute and even having a pan on
high<00:02:11.870> heat<00:02:12.020> by<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.410> way<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.550> now<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:14.150> time

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
high heat by the way so now it's time

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.300 
high heat by the way so now it's time
for<00:02:14.360> spinach<00:02:14.960> this<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.410> already<00:02:15.650> washed<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
for spinach this is already washed and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.880 
for spinach this is already washed and
drained<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.730> all<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:17.060> stuff<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.680> is

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
drained and all that stuff and this is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.720 
drained and all that stuff and this is
it<00:02:19.070> baby

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
it baby

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.910 
it baby
so<00:02:19.940> I'm<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.180> going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.420> chop<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.800> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so I'm just going to chop it up just a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.070 
so I'm just going to chop it up just a
little<00:02:21.950> bit<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.540> rough<00:02:23.690> chop<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.230> put<00:02:24.410> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.930 

throw<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:33.130> because<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.520> have<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> lot

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
throw this in because I just have a lot

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.030 
throw this in because I just have a lot
of<00:02:35.000> water<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.600> them<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:38.650> lot<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.830> water

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
of water in them so a lot of the water

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.320 
of water in them so a lot of the water
comes<00:02:40.370> out<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.670> that's<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:40.940> makes<00:02:41.240> it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
comes out and that's what makes it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.060 
comes out and that's what makes it
shrink<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:41.900> much<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:45.440> look<00:02:45.590> at<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:45.800> already

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
shrink so much see look at it's already

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.620 
shrink so much see look at it's already
shrinking<00:02:46.310> soon<00:02:46.790> as<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.000> touches<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.420> heat

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
shrinking soon as it touches that heat

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.320 
shrinking soon as it touches that heat
let<00:02:48.350> me<00:02:48.410> start<00:02:48.620> shrinking<00:02:49.060> look<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.209> that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
let me start shrinking look there that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.920 
let me start shrinking look there that
looks<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.850> would<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.150> actually<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.810> know

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
looks this would be actually you know

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.479 
looks this would be actually you know
what<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.500> could<00:02:54.620> technically<00:02:55.070> serve<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.459> just

what you could technically serve it just

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.900 
what you could technically serve it just
like<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.750> would<00:02:56.900> be<00:02:56.959> awesome<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.550> I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
like this and it would be awesome but I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.890 
like this and it would be awesome but I
have<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.180> make<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> little<00:02:59.600> bit<00:02:59.780> more
