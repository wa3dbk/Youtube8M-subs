00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.149
 sodomy 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.829
 should you go to fashion 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.180
 week of ready-to-wear not exactly 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.469
 before going to fashion week 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.850
 the minimum is to know your 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.620
 trend if not first you'll go 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.480
 for a big jug and in addition you have 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.729
 the apron against trend and that's 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.820
 so 2004 because you can kevin us 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.280
 Summarize the year 2004 chimene badi 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.110
 tragedy and the crops exactly then 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.200
 for that you go away because we call 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.450
 the tripled winner fog number and 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.220
 the official and with that you have everything 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.720
 you need to tan leather in 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.310
 the knowledge of which they are the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.990
 girls 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.369
 the big advantage to fashion week is 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 that you do not take yourself seriously 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.530
 for me fashion is an art with a 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.090
 iconoclastic voluptuousness at once bohemian 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.060
 in curves notwithstanding 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.950
 - you see jabbi the modern woman a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.020
 radical woman snow bichiques who 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.020
 evolve in a Baroque atmosphere 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:02:03.130

 animals those who are against the massacre 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.480
 animals and especially those that are 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.709
 for the massacre of the retina we will say 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.630
 understood fashion is really a world 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.819
 apart and really has rules of 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.319

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.880
