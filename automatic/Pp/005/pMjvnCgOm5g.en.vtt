00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
you want to break the eggs around where

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.000 
you want to break the eggs around where
the<00:01:26.810> air<00:01:27.410> sac<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:29.290> where<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.380> air<00:01:30.530> cell<00:01:30.800> is

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
the air sac is where the air cell is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.580 
the air sac is where the air cell is
because<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.820> don't<00:01:32.180> want<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.390> break<00:01:32.510> it<00:01:32.590> where

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
because you don't want to break it where

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.820 
because you don't want to break it where
the<00:01:33.770> chick<00:01:34.010> is<00:01:34.870> there's<00:01:35.870> blood<00:01:36.140> vessels<00:01:36.650> all

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
the chick is there's blood vessels all

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.970 
the chick is there's blood vessels all
through<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.820> membrane<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.660> if<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.710> bust

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
through the membrane and if you bust

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.150 
through the membrane and if you bust
them<00:01:40.250> blood<00:01:40.550> vessels<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.500> chick<00:01:42.740> could<00:01:42.920> bleed

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
them blood vessels the chick could bleed

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.820 
them blood vessels the chick could bleed
to<00:01:43.310> death<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.700> die<00:01:44.320> when<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.380> chick<00:01:45.680> is

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
to death and die when a chick is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.030 
to death and die when a chick is
hatching<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.490> slowly<00:01:46.960> breaks<00:01:47.960> through<00:01:48.830> them

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
hatching that slowly breaks through them

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.140 
hatching that slowly breaks through them
blood<00:01:49.310> vessels<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.570> sends<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:51.020> signal<00:01:51.230> to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
blood vessels and it sends a signal to

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.230 
blood vessels and it sends a signal to
the<00:01:53.150> chicks<00:01:53.630> body<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:55.040> stop<00:01:55.370> supplying<00:01:55.910> blood

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
the chicks body to stop supplying blood

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.830 
the chicks body to stop supplying blood
to<00:01:56.360> those<00:01:56.890> blood<00:01:57.890> vessels<00:01:58.600> that's<00:01:59.600> why<00:01:59.750> it

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
to those blood vessels that's why it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.160 
to those blood vessels that's why it
takes<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:00.260> long<00:02:00.410> for<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.710> chick<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.460> hatch<00:02:01.490> as<00:02:02.180> it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
takes so long for a chick to hatch as it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.760 
takes so long for a chick to hatch as it
slowly

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
slowly

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.930 
slowly
zips<00:02:04.400> its<00:02:04.700> way<00:02:04.850> around<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.330> egg<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.370> if<00:02:07.370> it

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
zips its way around the egg and if it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460 
zips its way around the egg and if it
was<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.420> ripped<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.780> top<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.319> egg<00:02:09.440> shell

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
was just ripped to top of the egg shell

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.559 
was just ripped to top of the egg shell
often<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.459> chick<00:02:10.640> would<00:02:10.759> bleed<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.150> death

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.580 

so<00:02:14.439> I<00:02:15.239> whenever<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.450> help<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.840> chick<00:02:17.079> HAP's<00:02:17.349> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
take just the top of the egg cell off

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.170 
take just the top of the egg cell off
where<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.989> air<00:02:20.109> cell<00:02:20.439> is<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.040> then<00:02:21.730> I'll<00:02:21.909> II

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
where the air cell is and then I'll II

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.380 
where the air cell is and then I'll II
leave<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.959> chick<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:24.549> bottom<00:02:24.909> half<00:02:25.150> of

thing once you get the shell off the top
of<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> egg<00:03:16.329> where<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.870> air<00:03:17.019> cell<00:03:17.379> is<00:03:18.329> you

of the egg where the air cell is you

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.689 
of the egg where the air cell is you
need<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.720> very<00:03:19.989> carefully<00:03:20.370> slide<00:03:21.370> the

where<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.400> eggshell<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.199> and<00:03:29.199> you<00:03:29.349> get<00:03:29.500> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
where the eggshell is and you get the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.030 
where the eggshell is and you get the
chicks<00:03:29.949> head<00:03:30.250> out<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:30.790> egg

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
chicks head out of the egg

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.559 
chicks head out of the egg
but<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.250> leave<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.819> rest<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.389> egg

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
but then leave the rest of the egg

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.819 
but then leave the rest of the egg
attached<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.750> then<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.930> check<00:03:38.199> once<00:03:38.590> it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
attached and then the check once it

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.430 
attached and then the check once it
absorbs<00:03:39.430> its<00:03:39.609> yolk<00:03:39.879> it<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.599> will<00:03:40.810> kick<00:03:41.049> its<00:03:41.229> way

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
absorbs its yolk it it will kick its way

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.890 
absorbs its yolk it it will kick its way
out<00:03:41.699> of<00:03:42.699> the<00:03:43.060> rest<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.510> shell

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.350 

well<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.860> wanted<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.700> make<00:03:53.120> sure<00:03:53.330> I

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
well I just wanted to make sure I

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.180 
well I just wanted to make sure I
pointed<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.930> out<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.170> people<00:03:54.470> who<00:03:54.680> haven't

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
pointed that out to people who haven't

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.899 
pointed that out to people who haven't
done<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.940> before<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:57.010> let<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.220> know<00:03:58.459> that

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.050 

it's<00:04:03.159> something<00:04:04.159> you<00:04:04.280> need<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.489> think<00:04:04.730> about

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
it's something you need to think about

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.420 
it's something you need to think about
before<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.450> do<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.900> because<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.950> could<00:04:07.129> end<00:04:07.310> up

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
before you do it because it could end up

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.020 
before you do it because it could end up
with<00:04:08.180> bad<00:04:08.420> results<00:04:09.099> but<00:04:10.099> I've<00:04:10.400> had<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.700> lot<00:04:11.000> of

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
with bad results but I've had a lot of

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.220 
with bad results but I've had a lot of
them<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.540> were<00:04:12.260> perfectly<00:04:12.920> fine<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.790> just

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
them that were perfectly fine that just

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.520 
them that were perfectly fine that just
couldn't<00:04:15.230> have<00:04:16.299> simply<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.750> either<00:04:18.199> they

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
couldn't have simply because either they

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.140 
couldn't have simply because either they
were<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:18.859> too<00:04:19.040> cramped<00:04:19.340> up<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.880> shell

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
were just too cramped up in the shell

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.110 
were just too cramped up in the shell
and<00:04:20.359> couldn't<00:04:20.690> get<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:20.989> position<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.820> crack

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
and couldn't get in position to to crack

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.080 
and couldn't get in position to to crack
the<00:04:23.300> egg<00:04:23.449> itself<00:04:24.789> or<00:04:25.789> anything

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
the egg itself or anything

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.779 
the egg itself or anything
I<00:04:26.180> usually<00:04:26.389> don't<00:04:27.110> help<00:04:27.500> them<00:04:27.800> though<00:04:28.070> unless

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
I usually don't help them though unless

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.830 
I usually don't help them though unless
they've<00:04:29.090> already<00:04:29.419> internally<00:04:30.289> picked<00:04:31.840> where

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
they've already internally picked where

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.810 
they've already internally picked where
they<00:04:33.020> broke<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.650> membrane<00:04:34.130> on<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.370> inside<00:04:34.460> of

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
they broke the membrane on the inside of

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.490 
they broke the membrane on the inside of
the<00:04:34.940> egg<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:35.389> they<00:04:35.510> haven't<00:04:35.870> sucked<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.260> show

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
the egg but they haven't sucked the show

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.129 
the egg but they haven't sucked the show
yet<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.190> then<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:37.940> only<00:04:38.120> time<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.479> help<00:04:38.900> them

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
yet and then the only time I help them

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.450 
yet and then the only time I help them
is<00:04:39.410> if<00:04:39.620> they've<00:04:39.889> been<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.400> way<00:04:41.440> for<00:04:42.440> like<00:04:43.430> a

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
is if they've been that way for like a

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.939 
is if they've been that way for like a
day<00:04:43.760> or<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.539> still<00:04:44.840> hasn't<00:04:45.080> cracked<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
day or so and still hasn't cracked the

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.029 
day or so and still hasn't cracked the
outside<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.580> egg<00:04:46.870> then<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.900> then<00:04:48.590> I'll<00:04:48.770> help

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
outside of the egg then I then I'll help

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.879 
outside of the egg then I then I'll help
them<00:04:49.280> or<00:04:49.940> if<00:04:50.300> they've<00:04:50.630> cracked<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.440> outside

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
them or if they've cracked the outside

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.430 
them or if they've cracked the outside
of<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.130> egg<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.900> aren't<00:04:53.900> making<00:04:54.050> any

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
of the egg and aren't making any

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.460 
of the egg and aren't making any
progress<00:04:54.800> after<00:04:55.370> 24<00:04:56.150> hours<00:04:56.180> if<00:04:56.750> they're<00:04:56.960> still

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
progress after 24 hours if they're still
