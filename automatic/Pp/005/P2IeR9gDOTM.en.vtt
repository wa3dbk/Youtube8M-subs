something<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.230> marketing<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.850> both<00:00:45.539> race

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
something like marketing how both race

of<00:01:00.870> black<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.760> good<00:01:03.750> way<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> kind

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
of black I think it's a good way to kind

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.539 
of black I think it's a good way to kind
of<00:01:04.589> break<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> doing<00:01:05.670> things<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:07.549> let's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
of break out of doing things in a let's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.899 
of break out of doing things in a let's
say<00:01:08.670> non<00:01:08.909> progressive<00:01:09.119> way<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:11.220> move

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
say non progressive way as we move

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
say non progressive way as we move
forward<00:01:12.530> it's<00:01:13.530> important<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> keep<00:01:14.340> having

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
forward it's important to keep having

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
forward it's important to keep having
conversations<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:16.130> push<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.060> think<00:01:18.530> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
conversations that push how we think and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.600 
conversations that push how we think and
are<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.280> more<00:01:20.520> progressive

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
are much more progressive

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.680 
are much more progressive
and<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.300> kind<00:01:22.660> of<00:01:22.750> complexify<00:01:23.620> and

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
and to kind of complexify and

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.950 
and to kind of complexify and
problematize<00:01:25.740> ways<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:27.010> thinking<00:01:27.250> which

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
problematize ways of thinking which

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.800 
problematize ways of thinking which
don't<00:01:28.960> necessarily<00:01:29.740> reflect<00:01:30.120> reality

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
don't necessarily reflect reality

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.840 
don't necessarily reflect reality
well<00:01:32.530> my<00:01:33.990> doctoral<00:01:34.990> work<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:35.920> Brazil<00:01:36.340> and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
well my doctoral work is in Brazil and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.530 
well my doctoral work is in Brazil and
if<00:01:37.480> you've<00:01:37.690> ever<00:01:37.870> been<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.770> Brazil<00:01:39.010> then<00:01:39.610> you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
if you've ever been to Brazil then you

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.170 
if you've ever been to Brazil then you
know<00:01:40.780> that<00:01:41.560> it's<00:01:42.130> not<00:01:42.340> about<00:01:42.550> race<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.090> about

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
know that it's not about race it's about

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.090 
know that it's not about race it's about
color<00:01:43.630> they<00:01:44.260> look<00:01:44.440> at<00:01:44.560> race<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> little<00:01:44.979> bit

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
color they look at race a little bit

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.780 
color they look at race a little bit
differently<00:01:45.400> than<00:01:45.580> how<00:01:45.910> we<00:01:45.970> look<00:01:46.270> at<00:01:46.390> race<00:01:46.570> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
differently than how we look at race and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.880 
differently than how we look at race and
I<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.290> project<00:01:50.530> speaks<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:53.500> of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
I think this project speaks to all of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.210 
I think this project speaks to all of
the<00:01:54.040> complicated<00:01:54.759> bits<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:55.990> pieces<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.650> race

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
the complicated bits and pieces of race

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.330 
the complicated bits and pieces of race
that<00:01:57.550> happened<00:01:57.910> not<00:01:58.000> only<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.420> US<00:01:59.340> with

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
that happened not only in the US with

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.070 
that happened not only in the US with
notions<00:02:00.670> like<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.910> one-drop<00:02:01.240> role<00:02:01.570> but<00:02:01.930> also

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
notions like the one-drop role but also

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.840 
notions like the one-drop role but also
what's<00:02:02.680> happening<00:02:03.009> in<00:02:03.070> Latin<00:02:03.310> America<00:02:03.729> and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
what's happening in Latin America and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.540 
what's happening in Latin America and
what's<00:02:04.000> happening<00:02:04.300> Latin<00:02:04.570> America<00:02:04.990> has<00:02:05.860> I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
what's happening Latin America has I

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.669 
what's happening Latin America has I
think<00:02:06.970> implications<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.290> lessons<00:02:08.619> learned

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
think implications and lessons learned

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.010 
think implications and lessons learned
for<00:02:09.369> what's<00:02:09.550> happening<00:02:09.850> in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.030> US<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.989> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
for what's happening in the US so the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.430 
for what's happening in the US so the
fact<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.350> we're<00:02:11.530> able<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:12.010> this

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
fact that we're able to have this

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.750 
fact that we're able to have this
cultural<00:02:14.440> dialogue<00:02:14.680> between<00:02:15.400> what's

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
cultural dialogue between what's

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040 
cultural dialogue between what's
happening<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.180> US<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.690> it's<00:02:16.780> happening

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
happening in the US and it's happening

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.449 
happening in the US and it's happening
in<00:02:17.140> other<00:02:17.200> places<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> world<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:18.220> really

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
in other places of the world is really

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.250 
in other places of the world is really
important<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.570> country<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:19.989> particular

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
important in this country in particular

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.470 
important in this country in particular
I<00:02:20.470> think<00:02:20.770> there<00:02:20.950> are<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.070> lot<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.310> myths<00:02:22.239> about

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
I think there are a lot of myths about

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.229 
I think there are a lot of myths about
race<00:02:22.870> there's<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> lot<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.770> tension<00:02:24.610> around

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
race there's a lot of tension around

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.690 
race there's a lot of tension around
race<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.870> country<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.489> can

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
race in this country and when you can

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.500 
race in this country and when you can
see<00:02:28.739> people<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.519> particular<00:02:30.820> race<00:02:31.180> or<00:02:31.390> of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
see people of a particular race or of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.900 
see people of a particular race or of
different<00:02:31.840> races<00:02:32.310> opening<00:02:33.310> up<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.580> talk<00:02:33.760> about

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
different races opening up to talk about

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.300 
different races opening up to talk about
sensitive<00:02:34.600> topics<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:35.350> race<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.950> sexuality

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
sensitive topics like race and sexuality

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.199 
sensitive topics like race and sexuality
I<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.900> becomes<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.980> wonderful<00:02:39.489> vehicle

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
I think that becomes a wonderful vehicle

do you see from this what are you seeing

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.150 
do you see from this what are you seeing
from<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:52.930> how<00:02:53.410> does<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.709> make<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:53.980> feel

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
and I think really making people pull on

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.190 
and I think really making people pull on
stuff<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.610> maybe<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:58.209> back<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:59.049> their

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
stuff that maybe just back that in their

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.020 
stuff that maybe just back that in their
minds<00:02:59.440> but<00:02:59.709> maybe<00:02:59.980> how<00:03:00.160> they<00:03:00.310> grew<00:03:00.549> up<00:03:00.730> things

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
minds but maybe how they grew up things

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.850 
minds but maybe how they grew up things
that<00:03:01.090> they<00:03:01.299> learn<00:03:01.540> from<00:03:01.810> their<00:03:02.260> parents<00:03:02.530> or

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
that they learn from their parents or

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.380

who are having experiences that are

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.690 
who are having experiences that are
similar<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.850> very<00:04:29.090> different<00:04:29.510> from<00:04:29.630> mine<00:04:30.700> just

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
similar to very different from mine just

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.610 
similar to very different from mine just
the<00:04:32.030> broad<00:04:32.270> spectrum<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.050> different

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
the broad spectrum of the different

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.910 
the broad spectrum of the different
experiences<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.340> people<00:04:34.670> have<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:36.890> I

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
experiences that people have and so I

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.050 
experiences that people have and so I
think<00:04:37.040> if<00:04:37.340> I'm<00:04:37.700> still<00:04:38.030> learning

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
think if I'm still learning

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.450 
think if I'm still learning
these<00:04:39.180> things<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.570> think<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.590> has<00:04:40.740> the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
these things I think that it has the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.540 
these things I think that it has the
potential<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.110> educate<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.260> inform<00:04:43.650> and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
potential to educate and inform and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.909 
potential to educate and inform and
provide<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:44.970> place<00:04:45.270> for<00:04:45.330> people<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.080> express

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
provide a place for people to express

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.990 
provide a place for people to express
these<00:04:47.250> ideas<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.510> think<00:04:48.990> very<00:04:49.880> important<00:04:50.880> to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
these ideas so I think very important to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.900 
these ideas so I think very important to
have<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:54.450> hold<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.320> an<00:04:55.410> idea<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.910> blackness

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
have a hold on to an idea that blackness

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.240 
have a hold on to an idea that blackness
has<00:04:56.970> many<00:04:57.330> things<00:04:57.690> there<00:04:58.500> may<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.650> some<00:04:58.980> things

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
has many things there may be some things

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
has many things there may be some things
that<00:04:59.340> are<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:01.620> connect<00:05:02.010> us<00:05:02.190> all<00:05:02.340> but<00:05:03.090> they're

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
that are that connect us all but they're

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.440 
that are that connect us all but they're
probably<00:05:03.810> nothing<00:05:04.200> that<00:05:04.790> singularly<00:05:05.790> defines

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
probably nothing that singularly defines

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.640 
probably nothing that singularly defines
what<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:06.990> means<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.980> be<00:05:08.100> black<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.730> I<00:05:09.630> think<00:05:10.440> if

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
what it means to be black so I think if

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.860 
what it means to be black so I think if
this<00:05:10.800> project<00:05:11.070> is<00:05:11.430> particularly<00:05:11.970> fascinating

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
this project is particularly fascinating

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.379 
this project is particularly fascinating
because<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.290> reminds<00:05:13.740> us<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:13.860> those<00:05:14.220> at<00:05:15.150> that

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
because it reminds us that those at that

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.129 
because it reminds us that those at that
simple<00:05:15.810> fact<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.970> creates<00:05:17.970> space<00:05:18.330> for<00:05:18.630> us<00:05:18.720> to

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
simple fact and creates space for us to

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.650 
simple fact and creates space for us to
kind<00:05:19.410> of<00:05:19.500> live<00:05:20.130> with<00:05:20.370> that

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
kind of live with that

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.400 
kind of live with that
that<00:05:22.410> ambiguity<00:05:23.450> kind<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.510> alongside<00:05:24.840> that

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
that ambiguity kind of alongside that

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.100 
that ambiguity kind of alongside that
kind<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.160> monolithic<00:05:26.820> belief<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.690> many<00:05:27.960> of

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
kind of monolithic belief that many of

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.670 
kind of monolithic belief that many of
us<00:05:28.200> have<00:05:28.440> about<00:05:28.710> like<00:05:28.889> being<00:05:29.280> black<00:05:29.580> is<00:05:30.680> many

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
us have about like being black is many

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:42.310 
us have about like being black is many
different<00:05:32.070> things

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.920 

you
