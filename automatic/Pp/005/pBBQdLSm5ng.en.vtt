00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.490
 time that now almost 2,500 mi has arrived 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.230
 like it and then soon if we get there e 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.300
 my girlfriend's video will come 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.980
 as you asked so many not 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.929
 there's the webcam because I had a little one 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.910
 problem for maybe I'll put a picture 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.320
 at the top right of me latch so if 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.909
 marshall webcam messages that is 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.729
 we make it bullshit 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.440
 let's start with the perfect video guys 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.269
 girl in today's video is very much 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 particular in my opinion is also 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.500
 interesting the title is very clear 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.049
 then how to make the most of the golems 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.699
 I'm all 1 I know I know the next one 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.680
 what I'll do here because of humor 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.049
 untapped ipex you didn't say it all 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.760
 will be making golems at 2 so i'm going 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.799
 aside sixty black and let's go to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.699
 get them golems at 2 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.330
 then what are we going to do 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.000
 we will use the earthquake potions chi 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.940
 It has already a part of the casino and golem 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.800
 a few very few ever chico 7 around 7 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.440
 because I can't do more 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.230
 they ask for the clan whatever I put 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.860
 everything even if it is a little late then 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.540
 I don't think there are people awake now and 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.100
 tiriamo comes together with sini 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.560
 while we wait for them to send us 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.720
 something 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.729
 and no boys then the goal of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.430
 this video what is to smooth out 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.860
 the road with the earthquake and try with 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.409
 of golems to do the most number of 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.899
 possible brothel with heroes and 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.020
 wizards we have and the clan if anyone 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.570
 let's go and look for a village 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.220
 with enough resources I know it is 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.950
 enough I mean nothing but say 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.200
 that is an interesting little thing I have to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.780
 resources because otherwise little 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.539
 meaning here he is and it's not bad I have in mind 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.459
 many videos with the earthquake and 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.350
 obviously if in this they will be if I see 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.759
 however, that you are not interested in I avoid 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.679
 do it obviously because it makes no sense that 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.600
 I make videos so randomly speak 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.030
 for me they are interesting as strategies 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.530
 because the age of the world are gods 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.220
 particular positions because they are enough 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.140
 few to open a very strong village 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.269
 so don't underestimate the boys 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.480
 because in my opinion if you use well they do 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.549
 really an absurd mess I read badly 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.110
 someone who has a lot of rice 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.140
 black because i spent a lot for a while 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.870
 make goals and then look for someone to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:41.350
 interesting guy i found a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.799
 Madonna village and I found it 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.130
 and it's all external it's all exterior 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:53.650
 so you have to do something like this 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:58.170
 then we split to 1 2 3 and 4 e 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:02.840
 we split here and we split here too 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:07.069
 yes just in here possible 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.370
 3 and 4 we split the whole village o 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.470
 my god practically stripped ok 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:19.280
 we launch our dear 6 golems ei 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:23.390
 maghetti behind king and queen well not 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.920
 we have because we used all there is 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.959
 we should be able to pull it all down 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.700
 it would be cool not everything maybe 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.410
 no, but let's try to do everything possible 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.319
 because this really is a village here 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.700
 absurd his Reggina lasted three 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.069
 quarter of a second perfect thousandth 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.400
 perfect I would say that the golems do theirs 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.329
 dirty work and make no group of 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.250
 give I must say perfect and my king 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.569
 Barbarian greets me however in the sense it is 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.170
 went to put in a part of the 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.280
 village that I had to avoid not 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.239
 I had to go there he had to fuck her 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.060
 because it was born of that obviously 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.940
 we take the black desir I stole one 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.799
 what as 4,000 we have to manage it 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.540
 made 50 percent municipalities also 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.019
 external 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.590
 the barbarian king still alive what the goals e 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.450
 which are all still standing are 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.840
 all still standing we did a 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:25.150
 very very good second attack but a 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.150
 that archer gives me some problems 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:35.030
 cabbage hm 6 here the reggina leaves me you 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.380
 please pull down pull down the store e 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.570
 get out 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.060
 oh well you go to die then it 's good good 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.560
 in the last resources with golems a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.030
 ours had not finished it is finished 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.010
 the attack 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.919
 I thought I could last a while 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.280
 however, he has stolen many resources 2000 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.620
 at the last 1200 of aran black below 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.510
 a little naive i think veteran joe everything 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.780
 for that I went on the safe side 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.950
 and instead nothing really all nothing 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.960
 however, it is a sufficient attack 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.230
 satisfying that I know that I know that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.060
 I close here because there is not 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.919
 not fail to shoot down the auger is 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.060
 all nov with the time also there is not 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.400
 It is a 3200 black attack 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.660
 I must say an attack as it should be 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.060
 face of those who tell me that I don't know 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.620
 attack this here is against them 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.690
 obviously I'm joking that is now 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.090
 honestly if one helps me why 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.130
 I make a bad attack on play off 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.410
 I say the facts check the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.150
 boy is a game a boys attack 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.650
 very very good in my opinion it is still 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.290
 one of the best I've done must of 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.560
 black we are at 26 thousand and we are half way through 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.810
 get to make us guys golems a 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.130
 level 2 because in these seas we will do 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.930
 some new attack with this one 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.330
 strategy here of goals that boys 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.580
 start using it if you want if you want 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.960
 because according to me and it works you have it 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.700
 also seen the tests with two videos 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.380

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.300
 crowd shelter boys do not fly e
