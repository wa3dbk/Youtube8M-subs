00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
then on concrete is concrete right here

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.199 
then on concrete is concrete right here
hidden<00:04:09.170> under<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:11.620> yes<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:13.099> is<00:04:13.280> my<00:04:13.430> fort<00:04:13.700> so

just snip as far as we can and then you

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.480 
just snip as far as we can and then you
get<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.600> idea<00:04:20.630> we're<00:04:21.199> just<00:04:21.350> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.560> grind

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
get the idea we're just going to grind

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.790 
get the idea we're just going to grind
it<00:04:22.729> till<00:04:22.850> it's<00:04:23.030> smooth<00:04:23.389> let's<00:04:24.050> just<00:04:24.320> snip<00:04:24.590> that

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
it till it's smooth let's just snip that

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.650 
it till it's smooth let's just snip that
piece<00:04:25.160> as<00:04:26.060> far<00:04:26.330> as<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:26.539> can<00:04:28.180> there<00:04:29.180> it'll<00:04:29.539> make

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
piece as far as you can there it'll make

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.820 
piece as far as you can there it'll make
it<00:04:29.780> go<00:04:29.810> but<00:04:30.020> my<00:04:30.320> plaster<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.160> then<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.830> guess

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it go but my plaster and then I guess

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.540 
it go but my plaster and then I guess
I'll<00:04:35.199> adjust<00:04:36.199> that<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.889> make<00:04:37.099> sure<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.400> it

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
I'll adjust that and make sure that it

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:56.379 
I'll adjust that and make sure that it
is<00:04:38.539> smooth<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:44.030> should<00:04:44.240> take<00:04:44.389> too<00:04:44.570> long
