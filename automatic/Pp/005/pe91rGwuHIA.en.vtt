 rhythmic level the sound is 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.810
 so very very interesting 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.880
 so I 'm going to talk to you a little bit about 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.350
 its history of conflict is a small 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.720
 little we can appreciate original so 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.650
 when i used so my fender strat 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.050
 I think it's a little bit 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.190
 necessary so with simple high pickups 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.990
 level went off of micro I 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.570
 so used the serious microphone so the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.640
 micro side handle level settings 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.710
 they are almost clear very very little 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.000
 crunch 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.880
 I added a little bit of compression 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.620
 in order to give a snap a little side a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.350
 little snap yahoo side are so here I 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.970
 I do not have compression with my 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.070
 black stars bought 5 and I applied 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.080

 with an agreement with that starts with a 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.610
 card it's pretty unusual as 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.470
