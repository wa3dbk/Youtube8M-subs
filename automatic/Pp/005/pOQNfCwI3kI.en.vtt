00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
your magic attack by 30 i think i'm a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
your magic attack by 30 i think i'm a
hundred<00:02:07.439> center<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> magic<00:02:08.250> attack<00:02:08.429> one

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.780 
hundred center on the magic attack one
and<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.800> classes<00:02:11.039> i<00:02:11.280> guess<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.640> also

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and for all classes i guess you can also

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.920 
and for all classes i guess you can also
go<00:02:12.000> for

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
go for

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.619 
go for
the<00:02:13.290> green<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.709> which<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.920> weapons<00:02:14.879> speed<00:02:15.299> and

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
the green one which is weapons speed and

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.030 
the green one which is weapons speed and
all<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.329> increases<00:02:18.329> all<00:02:18.540> your<00:02:18.870> RSA<00:02:19.829> you're

a bit especially if you want to use our
early<00:02:49.620> levels<00:02:49.889> you<00:02:49.950> can<00:02:49.980> speed<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.760> your<00:02:51.030> suite

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
early levels you can speed up your suite

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.240 
early levels you can speed up your suite
of<00:02:52.019> training<00:02:52.379> on<00:02:52.470> University<00:02:52.829> monsters<00:02:53.159> that

are a bit higher than you and you kind

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.569 
are a bit higher than you and you kind
of<00:02:55.019> tend<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.349> miss<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.069> increasing<00:02:56.400> rate

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
of tend to miss so increasing rate

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.309
