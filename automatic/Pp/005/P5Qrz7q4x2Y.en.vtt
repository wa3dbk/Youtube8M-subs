00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
more systems in Terrebonne mud we still

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.150 
more systems in Terrebonne mud we still
be<00:00:22.900> before<00:00:23.170> warp<00:00:23.530> hat<00:00:23.710> but<00:00:23.890> it's<00:00:24.010> been

last<00:00:28.510> year<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.980> this<00:00:30.370> year<00:00:30.580> we're<00:00:30.730> not

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
last year also this year we're not

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.729 
last year also this year we're not
running<00:00:31.000> of<00:00:31.240> nights<00:00:31.420> off<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.990> dyno<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.500> front

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
running of nights off the dyno the front

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.590 
running of nights off the dyno the front
part<00:00:33.039> we've<00:00:33.640> actually<00:00:33.789> been<00:00:34.000> open<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.480> bus

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
part we've actually been open to the bus

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.150 
part we've actually been open to the bus
system<00:00:34.750> itself<00:00:35.230> so<00:00:35.500> they're<00:00:35.710> only<00:00:35.950> need<00:00:36.130> a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
system itself so they're only need a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.069 
system itself so they're only need a
really<00:00:36.490> low<00:00:36.640> voltage<00:00:37.150> we<00:00:37.660> can<00:00:37.690> actually<00:00:37.870> use

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
really low voltage we can actually use

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.660 
really low voltage we can actually use
the<00:00:38.200> head<00:00:38.350> unit<00:00:38.500> here<00:00:38.770> if<00:00:38.829> i<00:00:38.920> demonstrate<00:00:39.400> to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
the head unit here if i demonstrate to

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.819 
the head unit here if i demonstrate to
turn<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:39.970> lights<00:00:40.150> on<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.660> off<00:00:41.260> whilst

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
turn the lights on and off whilst

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.319 
turn the lights on and off whilst
running<00:00:42.070> there's<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.640> really<00:00:42.940> neat<00:00:43.090> feature

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
running there's a really neat feature

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.940 
running there's a really neat feature
there's<00:00:43.720> no<00:00:43.840> messing<00:00:44.200> about<00:00:44.290> with<00:00:44.470> it<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
there's no messing about with it to the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.670 
there's no messing about with it to the
services<00:00:45.550> systems<00:00:46.000> right<00:00:46.210> on<00:00:46.420> top<00:00:46.690> at<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
services systems right on top at the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160 
services systems right on top at the
front<00:00:47.860> there<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.160> generate<00:00:48.280> power<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.600> we've

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
front there to generate power so we've

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.770 
front there to generate power so we've
got<00:00:50.380> a<00:00:50.620> some<00:00:51.520> sort<00:00:51.760> wrecking<00:00:52.270> ball<00:00:52.510> from<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
got a some sort wrecking ball from the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.600 
got a some sort wrecking ball from the
front<00:00:53.020> it<00:00:53.200> has<00:00:53.380> got<00:00:53.560> a<00:00:53.590> knock<00:00:53.829> out<00:00:54.040> as<00:00:54.370> well

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
front it has got a knock out as well

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.030 
front it has got a knock out as well
it's<00:00:55.149> only<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.450> small<00:00:55.780> crowd<00:00:56.079> before<00:00:56.470> but<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
it's only a small crowd before but the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.160 
it's only a small crowd before but the
lockout<00:00:57.370> itself<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:58.000> not<00:00:58.149> completely<00:00:58.750> on<00:00:58.930> or

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
lockout itself is not completely on or

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.330 
lockout itself is not completely on or
completely<00:00:59.530> off<00:00:59.649> you<00:00:59.829> can<00:00:59.950> actually<00:01:00.010> have<00:01:00.309> it

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
completely off you can actually have it

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.280 
completely off you can actually have it
halfway<00:01:00.940> in<00:01:01.210> between<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.780> want<00:01:02.020> as<00:01:02.140> well

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
halfway in between if you want as well

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.139 
halfway in between if you want as well
which<00:01:02.469> is<00:01:02.590> really<00:01:02.620> leaves<00:01:03.070> most<00:01:03.430> lockout<00:01:03.940> so

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
which is really leaves most lockout so

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.840 
which is really leaves most lockout so
just<00:01:04.329> on<00:01:04.509> and<00:01:04.869> off<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.649> stage<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.700> can

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
just on and off so to stage this you can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.310 
just on and off so to stage this you can
have<00:01:06.939> anywhere<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.540> between<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:08.080> if<00:01:08.170> you're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
have anywhere in between so if you're

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.960 
have anywhere in between so if you're
right<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.740> want<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:08.979> conserve<00:01:09.310> energy

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
right and you want to conserve energy

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.180 
right and you want to conserve energy
haha<00:01:10.600> get<00:01:10.990> off<00:01:11.110> if<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.380> want<00:01:11.590> if<00:01:11.860> you're<00:01:12.040> not

bike<00:02:34.900> obviously<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.050> year<00:02:36.110> was<00:02:36.410> working

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709

that's<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.070> high<00:02:37.510> crosses<00:02:38.510> over<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.930> battery

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
that's the high crosses over the battery

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.440 
that's the high crosses over the battery
itself<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.370> becomes<00:02:40.970> very<00:02:41.269> much

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
itself so it becomes very much

itself so it becomes very much
integrated<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.620> nice<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.280> look<00:02:43.400> at<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
integrated it's nice to look at the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.400 
integrated it's nice to look at the
frame<00:02:45.350> itself<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:46.269> German<00:02:47.269> bill<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.810> it's<00:02:47.989> -

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
frame itself is German bill that it's -

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.009

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
Frank all the capabilities in terms so

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.690 
Frank all the capabilities in terms so
you've<00:02:51.140> got<00:02:51.290> nothing<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.620> snag<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.310> usually

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
you've got nothing to snag it usually

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.060 
you've got nothing to snag it usually
look<00:02:52.850> better<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.200> becomes<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.860> little<00:02:54.980> more

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
look better and it becomes a little more

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.830 
look better and it becomes a little more
practical<00:02:55.489> when<00:02:55.760> using<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.150> day<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.329> day

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
practical when using it day to day

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.750 
practical when using it day to day
so<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> battery<00:02:57.650> retain<00:02:57.980> my<00:02:58.130> most<00:02:58.459> popular

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
so the battery retain my most popular

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.699 
so the battery retain my most popular
