00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.700 

I<00:00:05.930> think<00:00:06.930> nutrition<00:00:07.319> makes<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.529> massive

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
I think nutrition makes a massive

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.549 
I think nutrition makes a massive
difference<00:00:07.890> when<00:00:08.670> you're<00:00:08.760> training<00:00:09.559> training

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
difference when you're training training

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.100 
difference when you're training training
regularly<00:00:10.800> then<00:00:11.760> it's<00:00:12.240> not<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.900> that

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
regularly then it's not just about that

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.629 
regularly then it's not just about that
session<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.800> you<00:00:13.889> need<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.280> thinking

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
session but you need to be thinking

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.829 
session but you need to be thinking
about<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.090> session<00:00:15.450> you're<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.780> be

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
about the session you're going to be

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
about the session you're going to be
doing<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.170> four<00:00:16.320> days<00:00:16.500> time<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.279> learnt

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
doing in four days time as I've learnt

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
doing in four days time as I've learnt
to<00:00:17.880> use<00:00:18.739> nutritional<00:00:19.739> products<00:00:20.009> a<00:00:20.070> bit<00:00:20.099> better

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to use nutritional products a bit better

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
to use nutritional products a bit better
it's<00:00:20.610> definitely<00:00:21.509> helped<00:00:22.079> me<00:00:22.110> to<00:00:22.290> train

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
it's definitely helped me to train

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.030 
it's definitely helped me to train
harder<00:00:23.810> it's<00:00:24.810> both<00:00:25.079> in<00:00:25.230> terms<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> fueling

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
harder it's both in terms of fueling

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.620 
harder it's both in terms of fueling
feeling<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.759> outings<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.270> particularly

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
feeling the outings and particularly

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
feeling the outings and particularly
recovering<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.430> big<00:00:29.610> guys<00:00:29.730> are

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
recovering from it the big guys are

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.490 
recovering from it the big guys are
probably<00:00:30.119> taking<00:00:30.239> on<00:00:30.480> 6,000<00:00:31.050> calories<00:00:31.169> a<00:00:31.410> day

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
probably taking on 6,000 calories a day

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.520 
probably taking on 6,000 calories a day
and<00:00:32.149> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.719> three<00:00:33.750> meals<00:00:34.170> but

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and you can do that in three meals but

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
and you can do that in three meals but
you<00:00:34.800> need<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.310> be<00:00:35.430> snacking<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> and

it's<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:27.870> things<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.409> make

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it's the little things that will make

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's the little things that will make
the<00:01:28.680> big<00:01:28.860> difference<00:01:29.010> in<00:01:29.430> performance<00:01:30.200> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the big difference in performance and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
the big difference in performance and
nutrition<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> clearly<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
nutrition is clearly one of them so you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.990 
nutrition is clearly one of them so you
know<00:01:34.170> you've<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.159> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
know you've got to get that right it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580 
know you've got to get that right it's
like<00:01:36.210> putting<00:01:36.510> fuel<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:36.990> car<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.440> you

like putting fuel in your car if you
don't<00:01:37.740> put<00:01:37.950> any<00:01:38.040> fuel<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.430> car<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.940> won't

don't put any fuel in your car it won't

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
don't put any fuel in your car it won't
go<00:01:39.299> anywhere<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.320> putting<00:01:40.500> fuel<00:01:40.830> into

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
go anywhere so you're putting fuel into

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
go anywhere so you're putting fuel into
your<00:01:41.159> body<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.790> able<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> perform<00:01:42.210> part<00:01:42.990> of

your body to be able to perform part of
my<00:01:43.170> ritual<00:01:43.350> before<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.830> race<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.880> get

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
my ritual before a race will be to get

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.539 
my ritual before a race will be to get
the<00:01:45.210> caffeine<00:01:45.570> gels<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> at<00:01:46.590> certain<00:01:46.950> times<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the caffeine gels in at certain times I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.399 
the caffeine gels in at certain times I
do<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.030> hour<00:01:48.180> before<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> race<00:01:48.900> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
do it in an hour before the race and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.810 
do it in an hour before the race and
then<00:01:49.740> they've<00:01:49.890> gained<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.310> half<00:01:50.549> an<00:01:50.700> hour

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
then they've gained about half an hour

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.630 
then they've gained about half an hour
before<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> race<00:01:51.330> eat<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> balanced<00:01:52.200> diet

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
before the race eat a balanced diet

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
before the race eat a balanced diet
maintain<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.880> weight<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.750> healthy<00:01:55.530> level

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
maintain your weight at a healthy level

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.850 
maintain your weight at a healthy level
and<00:01:56.330> eat<00:01:57.330> as<00:01:57.659> close<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.229> training<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and eat as close to training as is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.510 
and eat as close to training as is
sensible

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
sensible

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.610 
sensible
so<00:02:00.060> as<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:00.900> absorb<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.650> food

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
so as you actually absorb the food

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.750 
so as you actually absorb the food
good<00:02:03.520> state<00:02:03.790> we<00:02:04.600> would<00:02:04.869> always<00:02:05.110> have<00:02:05.290> our<00:02:05.799> Rico

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
good state we would always have our Rico

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.669 
good state we would always have our Rico
or<00:02:06.880> recovery<00:02:07.299> fuel<00:02:07.540> after<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> water<00:02:08.200> session

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
or recovery fuel after a water session

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.070 
or recovery fuel after a water session
it<00:02:09.580> plays<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.880> big<00:02:10.060> part<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.420> our<00:02:10.479> land<00:02:10.869> training

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
it plays a big part in our land training

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.230 
it plays a big part in our land training
and<00:02:11.319> our<00:02:11.380> weights<00:02:11.590> training<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:12.490> use<00:02:12.730> rapid

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
and our weights training we use rapid

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.910 
and our weights training we use rapid
and<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> think<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.140> really<00:02:14.290> helps<00:02:14.530> us<00:02:14.590> recover

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and I think that really helps us recover

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.710 
and I think that really helps us recover
and<00:02:15.220> also<00:02:15.490> push<00:02:16.060> on<00:02:16.209> during<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.600> weight

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and also push on during the weight

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.990 
and also push on during the weight
session<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.290> think<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.340> wouldn't<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.819> one<00:02:18.940> of

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
session I think it wouldn't be one of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.160 
session I think it wouldn't be one of
the<00:02:19.090> biggest<00:02:19.330> differences<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> last<00:02:20.020> few

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the biggest differences in the last few

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.960 
the biggest differences in the last few
years<00:02:20.380> with<00:02:20.590> our<00:02:20.770> team<00:02:21.040> definitely<00:02:21.250> it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
years with our team definitely it's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.030 
years with our team definitely it's
about<00:02:22.209> coping<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.050> about<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.680> keeping

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
about coping and it's about it's keeping

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.890 
about coping and it's about it's keeping
standards<00:02:24.400> high<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.580> that's<00:02:24.910> why<00:02:25.120> we'll

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
standards high and that's why we'll

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
standards high and that's why we'll
always<00:02:26.080> use<00:02:26.260> products<00:02:26.680> before<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.340> going

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
always use products before we get going

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.280 
always use products before we get going
while<00:02:28.270> we're<00:02:28.450> going<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.780> then<00:02:28.870> after<00:02:29.140> we're

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
while we're going and then after we're

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.449 
while we're going and then after we're
going<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.650> they're<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:30.100> slightly<00:02:30.370> different

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
going and they're all slightly different

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.000 
going and they're all slightly different
products<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.239> they<00:02:32.020> all<00:02:32.110> are<00:02:32.500> absolutely

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
products and they all are absolutely

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.610 
products and they all are absolutely
crucial<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:34.330> keep<00:02:34.600> us<00:02:34.780> at<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> level<00:02:35.560> we

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
crucial to to keep us at the level we
