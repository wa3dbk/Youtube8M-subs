00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 I come out now as a noble coupe 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.259
 far away i just like the porsche 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.700
 panamera 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 the same applies to the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.139
 coupes of the mercedes s class groomed 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
 understatement with power and driving culture 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 the cl is now new and it is 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.130
 a really good opportunity the two 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.140
 to compare and even better 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.880
 occasion one of the most experienced of the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.510
 car picture test team on the fingers 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.460
 watch 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 jürgen von gosen is the name of our man for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.150
 the mercedes porsche comparison and he 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.010
 is first of all a normal one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.529
 car driver when it comes to getting to know the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 Candidates will go two in this case 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.219
 absolute luxury cars at first 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 look more different than 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.860
 Mergers have mercedes elegance 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.410
 and luxurious with two doors of porsche 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.850
 crisp sporty and 4 doors but exactly 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.160
 that's the attraction 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 mercedes goes with the cl namely completely 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.550
 Close to the porsche zoom 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.320
 the claim is already very 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.539
 different mercedes was so far 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 in his coupés always very on the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.780
 luxury class aligned so too 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.280
 Comfortably is luxuriously relaxed driving 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.140
 and porsche did that for the first time 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 Panamera a vehicle for four people 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 in a sporty class released 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 so far I'm expecting that is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 porsche me the sporty direction 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 favors more during the Mercedes 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 on the luxury rail destination the approach 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.659
 So must be called how athletic is the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.180
 mercedes how luxurious the porsche at 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.979
 cl introduces the new offensive style 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.409
 all in the more aggressive strong 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.380
 contoured bonnet applied to it 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.030
 come new bumpers and headlights 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 against the brawny panamera acts of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.600
 mercedes but still easier too 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.299
 if the porsche compared to a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.610
 911 is much more elegant for 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.070
 a two-door the five meter 10 of the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.770
 Mercedes of the industry counters with 497 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.649
 not bad but more representative 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.750
 is the benz so the pictures on 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.000
 cannes beach are now made 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.409
 must also move in for the photographer 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 the thing 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.320
 city cannes nice nice pictures 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 much traffic 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.549
 the two cars stay relaxed 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.439
 not to be disturbed by the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.120
 Mercedes is currently working on the 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.150
 speed swells 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.220
 the sovereign masters the smallest 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.670
 The 500cc has a very harmonic 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.340
 eight-cylinder biturbo engine with 435 hp 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.640
 and 620 Nm torque 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.950
 that's enough for regulated 250 km h 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.050
 top and sprint time from 0 to 100 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 in 4 9 seconds 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.670
 he takes the porsche panamera s 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.180
 despite 200 kilo more prosperity bacon on 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.880
 the ribs 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.740
 a tenth off that makes the porsche 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.490
 for it with his 400 hp eight cylinder 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.860
 suction motor in the top speed again 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.890
 282 km / h are without electronic lock 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.570
 possible that actually amazing though 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.430
 The mercedes manages the eu 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.660
 actually use among the ten 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.640
 liter brand to stay 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.350
 really for this performance class 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 the porsche impresses 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.950
 if already with 11.1 liters on average also 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.050
 no drunkard can not keep up 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 his panamera can then be his strengths 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.870
 but in the mountainous hinterland of the côte 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.730
 play d'azur 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.830
 this is where dynamism comes in 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.080
 sporty tuned chassis and one 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.170
 extremely precise steering on criteria such as 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.730
 the porsche clearly better 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.770
 so that in the end on the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.360
 photos in the folder has come over correctly 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.930
 our photographer is really hard now 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.450
 work 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.140
 take pictures in the border area of ​​course 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.140
 always secured 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.519
 Of course, very important first of all 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.099
 that for good photos have before the two 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.840
 cars that means here next to one 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.389
 photographers and go a nice 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.799
 location if possible where the weather 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.150
 nice it is not raining right now 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.280
 then we start with the two cars 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.689
 and photographed movie while watching 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.269
 the explorer so the curvy 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.590
 country roads quasi defeated and breathless 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.719
 behind it comes the mercedes 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.939
 hardly slower but very well maintained 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.480
 the engine is almost not forward 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.870
 hear 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.340
 driving can not be more relaxed 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.169
 the look inside confirms that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.810
 different approaches of cll and 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.150
 Panamera Mercedes reigns more luxurious 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.040
 plenty of shiny wood seats 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.840
 extremely soft and comfortable the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.969
 automatic selector lever is small and 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.400
 hidden behind the steering wheel central 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.250
 control element is the rotary press degree in 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 the center console in the porsche the 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.730
 typical round instruments and the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.889
 Central tachometer is everything 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.019
 sporty applied the selector lever sits 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.699
 present on the center console as well 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.639
 how many little buttons porsche 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.289
 consciously dispenses with the knob 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.299
 two cars that have their own character 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.769
 cultivate very offensively 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.380
 in principle, the two approach one another 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.479
 little bit known to the industry 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.220
 only for really crisp two-seater has 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.009
 Now a four-door model built a 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.930
 Four-seater with the one also luxurious 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.940
 can be on the road and mercedes has with 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.380
 the cl is still a very luxurious one 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.020
 car with yes but also quite once 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.909
 can drive sporty and for the whole 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.110
 then crazy with a cl very 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.509
 want to drive sporty 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.460
 Yesterday also the amg range there 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.120
 You can then enter 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.120
 the sporty ca 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.220
 which one is the better one in the end 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.200
 Mercedes is certainly one of the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.970
 sovereign cars that imagine 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.770
 but it is about the optimal 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.810
 compromise between sportiness and 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.090
 comfort then the porsche has the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.660
 nose for a breath in the front especially for him 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.880
 in comparison cheap 100 2251 euro too 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.310
 is that is opposite the mercedes 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.260
 a price advantage of more than 21,000 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.900
 euro and for the porsche would have 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.240
 be damned uncomfortable 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.130
 small addendum who wants to sport but on 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.480
 mercedes can not do without 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.430
 the stuttgarter have one more 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.340
 Attractive alternative in the garage 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.580
 stand 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.770
 cl 65 amg means the power coupe has 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.640
 a twelve-cylinder biturbo on board with 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.660
 1000 newton meters and 630 ps who wants 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.540
 can be the down-regulated 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.490
 top speed from 250 to 300 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.830
 plump up putting km / h 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.810
 Chassis and brakes were the increased 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.520
 efficiency adapted naturally 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.910
 sporty also the price 127 1825 euro 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.810
 and 50 cents is the biggest cl power 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.810
 sound included
