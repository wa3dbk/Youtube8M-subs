00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
reduced our hive loss over the winter so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.939 
reduced our hive loss over the winter so
the<00:00:24.869> first<00:00:25.050> thing<00:00:25.289> we're<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.740> is

having a top feeder if you have one on
your<00:00:45.480> hive<00:00:46.160> because<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> fact<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
hive it keeps the hive warm in the cold

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.750 
hive it keeps the hive warm in the cold
time<00:00:53.699> end<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.780> cool<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.469> warm<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.610> as

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you can see here the bees are doing very

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.470 
you can see here the bees are doing very
well<00:01:00.379> it's<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.559> easy<00:01:01.800> 9<00:01:02.190> frames<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:03.000> winter

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
well it's an easy 9 frames in winter

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.939 
well it's an easy 9 frames in winter
coming<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> winter<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.799> an

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
coming out of winter so that's an

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
coming out of winter so that's an
excellent<00:01:05.339> sign<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
excellent sign this right here is a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
excellent sign this right here is a
shortening<00:01:07.860> patty<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.729> should<00:01:08.880> always<00:01:09.030> have

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
shortening patty we should always have

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.760 
shortening patty we should always have
one<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.900> hive<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.500> times

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
one of these on your hive at all times

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.000 
one of these on your hive at all times
it's<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> Nasima<00:01:11.939> sorry<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it's for the Nasima sorry it is for the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
it's for the Nasima sorry it is for the
tracheal<00:01:15.000> mite<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.689> made<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
tracheal mite it's made out of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.550 
tracheal mite it's made out of
shortening<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> powdered<00:01:17.100> sugar<00:01:18.290> two<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> one

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
shortening and powdered sugar two to one

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.820 
shortening and powdered sugar two to one
ratio<00:01:19.740> okay<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.830> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
ratio okay so what we're going to do is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.140 
ratio okay so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.439> can<00:01:25.439> get<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> open

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
we're going to take I can get it open

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.090 
we're going to take I can get it open
we're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> take<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.439> ratio<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
we're going to take one to one ratio of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
we're going to take one to one ratio of
sugar<00:01:29.340> water<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:31.340> can<00:01:32.340> similar<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> see

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
sugar water a can similar to this see

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.890 
sugar water a can similar to this see
how<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> has<00:01:34.320> holes<00:01:34.590> okay<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.210> large<00:01:36.479> size

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
how it has holes okay it's a large size

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.410 
how it has holes okay it's a large size
kingdom<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.860> cannot<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.880> put<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
kingdom you cannot just put this in the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.719 
kingdom you cannot just put this in the
feed<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.049> feeder<00:01:40.290> okay<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
feed in the feeder okay you have to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.310 
feed in the feeder okay you have to
administer<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.229> okay<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.170> what

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
administer it this way okay so what

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.389 
administer it this way okay so what
we're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> we're<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.539 
we're going to do is we're going to
scoop<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:48.020> equivalency<00:01:49.070> bus<00:01:50.070> sugar<00:01:50.340> water

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
scoop out equivalency bus sugar water

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.880 
scoop out equivalency bus sugar water
have<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.600> separate<00:01:52.079> container<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.740> this

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
have a separate container because this

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.440 
have a separate container because this
is<00:01:53.040> obviously<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> leak<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.299> not

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
is obviously going to leak and it's not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.380 
is obviously going to leak and it's not
going<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.720> easy<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.079> mix<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> leaks

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
going to be easy to mix if it leaks

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.740 
going to be easy to mix if it leaks
take<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.570> few<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:57.869> ago<00:01:58.049> um<00:01:58.200> beat<00:01:59.630> up<00:02:00.630> witch
