00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
know I believe for past it's just too

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.289 
know I believe for past it's just too
much<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.070> bulky<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
much and it's very bulky because of that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.230 
much and it's very bulky because of that
and<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.860> bulkier<00:01:23.790> than<00:01:23.880> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and actually it was bulkier than this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.819 
and actually it was bulkier than this
but<00:01:26.299> yeah<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> had<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> did<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.680> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
but yeah I had to what I did was just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.219 
but yeah I had to what I did was just
take<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.159> piece<00:01:30.320> twist<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
take a piece twist it and then just and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.280 
take a piece twist it and then just and
do<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:36.079> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.490> not
