clip I hope you guys pass this around

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.950 
clip I hope you guys pass this around
people<00:00:09.800> need<00:00:09.950> to<00:00:09.980> see<00:00:10.190> what's<00:00:10.400> going<00:00:10.700> on<00:00:10.850> I<00:00:11.120> was

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
people need to see what's going on I was

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.980 
people need to see what's going on I was
setting<00:00:12.200> up<00:00:12.320> my<00:00:12.530> scope<00:00:12.910> Croat<00:00:13.910> said<00:00:14.630> hey<00:00:14.780> look

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
setting up my scope Croat said hey look

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.380 
setting up my scope Croat said hey look
there's<00:00:15.320> an<00:00:15.470> orb<00:00:15.650> and<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.429> manually<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:17.060> tried

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
there's an orb and so manually I tried

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.169 
there's an orb and so manually I tried
to<00:00:17.510> get<00:00:17.630> it<00:00:17.779> in<00:00:17.929> my<00:00:18.739> scopes<00:00:19.130> viewfinder<00:00:19.999> which

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
to get it in my scopes viewfinder which

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:26.380 
to get it in my scopes viewfinder which
is<00:00:20.810> not<00:00:20.960> an<00:00:21.079> easy<00:00:21.199> task<00:00:21.849> anyhow<00:00:25.149> here's<00:00:26.149> what<00:00:26.359> I

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
is not an easy task anyhow here's what I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.929 
is not an easy task anyhow here's what I
picked<00:00:26.659> up<00:00:26.890> at<00:00:27.890> first<00:00:28.159> I<00:00:28.369> thought<00:00:28.519> it<00:00:28.579> was<00:00:28.699> an

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
picked up at first I thought it was an

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.540 
picked up at first I thought it was an
orb<00:00:29.239> and<00:00:29.509> it's<00:00:30.140> very<00:00:30.349> difficult<00:00:30.589> to<00:00:31.009> operate

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
orb and it's very difficult to operate

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.729 
orb and it's very difficult to operate
the<00:00:31.970> scope<00:00:32.210> manually<00:00:32.840> with<00:00:33.079> no<00:00:33.260> controls

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
the scope manually with no controls

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.170 
the scope manually with no controls
because<00:00:33.950> everything's<00:00:34.399> in<00:00:34.550> reverse<00:00:34.910> and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
because everything's in reverse and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.770 
because everything's in reverse and
you're<00:00:35.420> kind<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.930> just<00:00:36.430> swinging<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:38.690> know

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
you're kind of just swinging you know

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.300 
you're kind of just swinging you know
what<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.020> see<00:00:39.200> is<00:00:39.320> backwards<00:00:39.830> to<00:00:40.040> what<00:00:40.160> you're

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
what you see is backwards to what you're

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.280 
what you see is backwards to what you're
doing<00:00:40.580> this<00:00:41.090> is<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.390> object<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:41.900> I<00:00:41.960> picked

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
doing this is the object that I picked

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.370 
doing this is the object that I picked
up<00:00:42.470> at<00:00:42.910> first<00:00:43.910> I<00:00:44.120> thought<00:00:44.300> wow<00:00:44.600> finally<00:00:45.230> we've

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
up at first I thought wow finally we've

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.820 
up at first I thought wow finally we've
got<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:46.700> telescope<00:00:47.210> on<00:00:47.390> an<00:00:47.540> orb<00:00:47.750> but<00:00:48.440> this

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
got a the telescope on an orb but this

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.710 
got a the telescope on an orb but this
is<00:00:49.040> no<00:00:49.220> orb<00:00:50.140> I've<00:00:51.310> seen<00:00:52.310> orbs<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:52.970> I've<00:00:53.420> seen<00:00:53.690> a

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
is no orb I've seen orbs and I've seen a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.720 
is no orb I've seen orbs and I've seen a
lot<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.930> things<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.920> are<00:00:55.100> bright<00:00:55.460> like<00:00:55.700> a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
lot of things that are bright like a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.480 
lot of things that are bright like a
welding<00:00:56.180> arc<00:00:56.390> this<00:00:56.720> thing<00:00:56.990> was<00:00:57.310> super<00:00:58.310> super

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
welding arc this thing was super super

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.090 
welding arc this thing was super super
white<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.810> Sun<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.079> going<00:01:00.470> down<00:01:00.620> behind

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
white but the Sun is going down behind

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.509 
white but the Sun is going down behind
it<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.239> what<00:01:02.420> happened<00:01:02.810> here<00:01:03.140> was<00:01:03.860> there<00:01:04.369> was

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
it now what happened here was there was

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.910 
it now what happened here was there was
a<00:01:04.549> chem<00:01:04.850> trail<00:01:05.200> that<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:06.380> going<00:01:06.560> through<00:01:06.829> now

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
a chem trail that it's going through now

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.789 
a chem trail that it's going through now
that<00:01:07.429> had<00:01:07.549> been<00:01:07.729> laid<00:01:07.909> I<00:01:08.469> don't<00:01:09.469> know<00:01:09.560> 10

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
that had been laid I don't know 10

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.830 
that had been laid I don't know 10
minutes<00:01:10.130> prior<00:01:10.429> 15<00:01:10.999> minutes<00:01:11.270> prior<00:01:11.539> was

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
minutes prior 15 minutes prior was

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.959 
minutes prior 15 minutes prior was
already<00:01:12.140> starting<00:01:12.469> to<00:01:12.590> widen<00:01:12.950> out<00:01:13.069> and<00:01:13.429> then

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
already starting to widen out and then

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.730 
already starting to widen out and then
there<00:01:14.119> was<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.270> fresh<00:01:14.569> chem<00:01:14.869> trail<00:01:15.170> laid<00:01:15.439> just

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
there was a fresh chem trail laid just

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.859 
there was a fresh chem trail laid just
over<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:16.520> assume<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:17.329> was<00:01:17.509> dropped

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
over it now I assume this was dropped

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.480 
over it now I assume this was dropped
out<00:01:18.109> of<00:01:18.139> that<00:01:18.350> chem<00:01:18.619> trail<00:01:18.920> plane<00:01:19.189> I<00:01:19.219> don't

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
out of that chem trail plane I don't

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.789 
out of that chem trail plane I don't
know<00:01:19.579> where<00:01:19.759> else<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.090> could<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.389> come<00:01:20.509> from

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
know where else it could have come from

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.499 
know where else it could have come from
the<00:01:21.799> chem<00:01:22.159> trails<00:01:22.460> were<00:01:22.609> very<00:01:22.880> low<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.359> close

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
the chem trails were very low and close

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.010 
the chem trails were very low and close
together<00:01:24.460> as<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:26.149> can<00:01:26.299> see<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.600> almost<00:01:26.810> looks

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
together as you can see it almost looks

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.359 
together as you can see it almost looks
like<00:01:27.079> it<00:01:27.229> has<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> phase<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.159> don't<00:01:28.310> know

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
like it has a phase on it I don't know

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.889 
like it has a phase on it I don't know
whether<00:01:28.549> it's<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.939> Sun<00:01:29.179> coming<00:01:29.479> through<00:01:29.630> this

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
whether it's the Sun coming through this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.800 
whether it's the Sun coming through this
thing<00:01:30.139> or<00:01:30.350> what's<00:01:30.560> going<00:01:30.829> on<00:01:31.069> but<00:01:31.569> as<00:01:32.569> this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
thing or what's going on but as this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.260 
thing or what's going on but as this
thing<00:01:33.079> began<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.649> drop<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.340> noticed<00:01:35.060> another

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
thing began to drop I noticed another

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.029 
thing began to drop I noticed another
thing<00:01:35.689> you<00:01:35.929> can<00:01:36.020> see<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.319> chemtrails<00:01:36.889> are

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
thing you can see the chemtrails are

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.429 
thing you can see the chemtrails are
going<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.579> left<00:01:37.819> and<00:01:38.299> this<00:01:38.479> round<00:01:38.990> I'll

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
going to the left and this round I'll

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.639 
going to the left and this round I'll
call<00:01:39.859> it<00:01:40.069> on<00:01:40.189> orbitz<00:01:40.609> not<00:01:40.819> Norb<00:01:41.209> is<00:01:41.959> going<00:01:42.560> to

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
call it on orbitz not Norb is going to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.139 
call it on orbitz not Norb is going to
the<00:01:42.740> right<00:01:42.920> almost<00:01:43.639> like<00:01:43.819> it's<00:01:43.969> being

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
the right almost like it's being

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.999 
the right almost like it's being
controlled<00:01:44.359> somehow<00:01:45.020> it's<00:01:45.229> going<00:01:45.469> against

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
controlled somehow it's going against

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.769 
controlled somehow it's going against
the<00:01:46.159> breeze<00:01:46.429> that's<00:01:46.789> pushing<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.209> chemtrails

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779 
the breeze that's pushing the chemtrails

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:52.419 
the breeze that's pushing the chemtrails
to<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.109> left<00:01:48.670> now<00:01:50.289> watch<00:01:51.289> this<00:01:51.649> clip<00:01:52.009> until

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
to the left now watch this clip until

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.489 
to the left now watch this clip until
three<00:01:52.729> minutes<00:01:53.029> and<00:01:53.149> 30<00:01:53.389> seconds<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
three minutes and 30 seconds you have to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.800

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
it on the computer I realized I tracked

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.539

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
footage this picks up again right at the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.449 
footage this picks up again right at the
explosion<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.230> lowest<00:03:10.769> thing<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.069> can<00:03:11.250> see

here is like a red amber and I was

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.620 
here is like a red amber and I was
looking<00:03:13.739> in<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.130> 3-inch<00:03:14.580> LCD<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.360> couldn't

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
looking in a 3-inch LCD so I couldn't

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.780 
looking in a 3-inch LCD so I couldn't
really<00:03:15.750> tell<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> picked<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.370> brightest

thing which is that white thing which i
believe<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.310> container<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.420> held

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
believe is just the container that held

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
believe is just the container that held
