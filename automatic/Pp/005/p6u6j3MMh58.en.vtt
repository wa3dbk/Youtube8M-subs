these<00:00:54.930> pushes<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.500> really<00:00:55.680> neat<00:00:55.860> because

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
these pushes are really neat because

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
these pushes are really neat because

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
actually has the in-house I've every

seen movement in it with the peloton
winding<00:01:11.130> system<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.720> felt<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.350> dial<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
winding system but I felt the dial of

winding system but I felt the dial of
this<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.490> looked<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.210> nicer<00:01:15.689> and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
this one looked a little bit nicer and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.630 
this one looked a little bit nicer and
since<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.200> mg<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.590> sort<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> engineer

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
since the mg are sort of the engineer

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
since the mg are sort of the engineer
series<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.210> watches<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> Faraday<00:01:22.409> cages

in<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.970> can't<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> movement

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
in them you can't see the movement

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
in them you can't see the movement
anyway<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:26.070> doesn't<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.520> matter<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
anyway so it doesn't really matter it is

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.499 
anyway so it doesn't really matter it is
kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> nice<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> in-house

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

the market it's just the mill cause as
far<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.470> remember

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.560 

so<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.210> stick<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.690> one<00:01:54.900> in<00:01:56.570> various

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
so you can stick this one in various

so you can stick this one in various
magnetic<00:01:57.990> fields<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.860> should<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.190> okay

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
magnetic fields and you should be okay

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.530 
magnetic fields and you should be okay
I'm<00:02:00.720> not<00:02:00.960> sure<00:02:01.430> how<00:02:02.430> strong<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.730> magnetic<00:02:03.270> field

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I'm not sure how strong a magnetic field

80,000 year where Em's is but you can
check<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> out

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
check that out

one of these through the side it will

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.340 
one of these through the side it will
just<00:02:30.870> pop<00:02:31.110> out<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:32.130> could<00:02:32.430> change<00:02:33.150> here<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
just pop out you could change here the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.290
