00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.260
 Hello everyone and welcome to the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.210
 Steria clubs I hope you will 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.460
 well today a flash info well 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.360
 special then the first info this is the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.339
 so ultimate sauna skin dj will soon 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.719
 already dj who will be going out soon I thought 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.310
 not that it was sauna dj told me good 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.040
 it was going to be another character and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 all this dr fall is a there are three 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.180
 music that came out so three 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.070
 videos 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.440
 I am no longer the titles but I 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.380
 place room in the description you and 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.770
 see that behind there are three musics 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.080
 and in fact everybody says it's 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.340
 I have not seen the official texts 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.850
 said do not hesitate to put that in 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.430
 comments 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.840
 but apparently it's a sauna skin 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.150
 so that said I found that I 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.970
 weird since sauna already has a lot of 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:52.190
 skins including the Arcadine sauna which makes a 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.350
 little bit so in my opinion I think that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.970
 it's actually the skin of 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.239
 sauna dj who finally alain what 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.309
 is called dj sauna that will come out 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.520
 I hope it's happening here and there 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.190
 send pate because the music 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.790
 are really not bad for the second 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.649
 information 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.300
 so you have to know for those who do not 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.500
 do not know that in the fault of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 the summoner there are symbols that 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.080
 so three symbols appear 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.869
 points followed by three traits I do not know 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.930
 not what it is but in my opinion it 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.820
 could be related to the mu with this 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.330
 which came out compared to before because 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.940
 that fo one might think maybe a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.560
 symbol the symbol of a menu otherwise it's 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.270
 a good new champion there I'm not going 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 no longer forget because I do not know 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.770
 too much there is really in the blur 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 so if you have any information 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670
 put them in the comments for 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.150
 know but it's extremely frustrating 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.549
 as a symbol I do not know maybe 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.619
 it comes from rim home has its strengths and 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.150
 very likely i think it's a you 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.720
 know like the symbols I saw how 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.340
 it's called in the teeth 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.259
 pyramids and all that I think it 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.450
 must be it must leave a this kind of 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.820
 symbol not at all it finds or not 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.470
