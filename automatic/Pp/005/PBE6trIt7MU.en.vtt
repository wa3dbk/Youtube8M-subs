00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
these are I would say pretty much

purely<00:04:05.180> based<00:04:05.330> on<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.750> disc<00:04:06.760> contents<00:04:11.890> pretty

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
purely based on the disc contents pretty

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.690 
purely based on the disc contents pretty
easy<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.400> remove<00:04:13.670> right<00:04:13.940> away<00:04:15.160> it's<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.280> second

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
easy to remove right away it's a second

disc when a woman wants to see what it
looked<00:04:18.680> like<00:04:18.770> I<00:04:20.710> think<00:04:21.710> this<00:04:21.890> discord<00:04:22.820> work<00:04:23.000> is

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
looked like I think this discord work is

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.920 
looked like I think this discord work is
pretty<00:04:23.420> similar<00:04:24.400> on<00:04:25.400> all<00:04:25.790> editions<00:04:26.510> as<00:04:26.690> well

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
pretty similar on all editions as well

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.770 
pretty similar on all editions as well
actually<00:04:27.170> one<00:04:27.590> all<00:04:27.770> through<00:04:28.040> this<00:04:28.070> condition

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
actually one all through this condition

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.750 
actually one all through this condition
but<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.020> am<00:04:30.080> NOT<00:04:30.290> hundred<00:04:30.830> percent<00:04:31.190> sure<00:04:31.310> about

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
but I am NOT hundred percent sure about

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.700 
but I am NOT hundred percent sure about
it<00:04:31.970> just<00:04:32.930> inside<00:04:33.500> also

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.450 

so<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:42.040> chat<00:04:42.970> not<00:04:43.390> is<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.500> chapter<00:04:44.770> selection

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
so the chat not is a chapter selection

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.050 
so the chat not is a chapter selection
on<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.730> inside<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.890> booklet<00:04:48.310> itself<00:04:48.730> is

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
on the inside and the booklet itself is

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.640 
on the inside and the booklet itself is
not<00:04:49.270> very<00:04:51.690> not<00:04:52.690> very<00:04:52.900> many<00:04:53.830> pages<00:04:54.220> only<00:04:55.650> very

not very not very many pages only very

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.480 
not very not very many pages only very
simple<00:05:00.270> there's<00:05:01.270> some<00:05:01.540> more<00:05:01.810> specs<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.340> know

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
simple there's some more specs you know

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.420

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
additional barcode I'm not sure if this

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.090 
additional barcode I'm not sure if this
is<00:05:32.980> like<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.960> limited<00:05:35.410> edition<00:05:35.500> first

there<00:05:43.150> are<00:05:43.240> two<00:05:43.420> separate<00:05:43.900> but<00:05:45.270> what<00:05:46.270> doesn't

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
there are two separate but what doesn't

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.270 
there are two separate but what doesn't
really<00:05:46.810> matter<00:05:47.050> just<00:05:47.410> thought<00:05:47.710> it<00:05:47.830> would<00:05:48.220> be

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
really matter just thought it would be

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.470 
really matter just thought it would be
fun<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.640> know<00:05:52.440> well<00:05:53.440> I<00:05:53.730> guess<00:05:54.730> that's<00:05:55.030> that

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
fun to know well I guess that's that

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.300 
fun to know well I guess that's that
about<00:05:55.900> just<00:05:56.170> for<00:05:56.440> packaging<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:58.960> as<00:05:59.920> for<00:06:00.220> the

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
as your average specialization you got

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.420 
as your average specialization you got
to<00:06:09.820> audio<00:06:10.180> commentaries<00:06:10.870> and<00:06:11.110> a<00:06:11.980> whole<00:06:12.400> bunch

production<00:06:20.290> so<00:06:20.890> I<00:06:21.270> think<00:06:22.270> everyone<00:06:23.020> would

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
production so I think everyone would

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.030 
production so I think everyone would
will<00:06:23.590> be<00:06:23.740> pretty<00:06:24.130> pleased<00:06:24.550> with<00:06:24.790> this<00:06:26.040> little

this at about you know eight out of 10
for<00:06:39.389> the<00:06:40.169> packaging<00:06:40.620> is<00:06:40.650> concerned<00:06:41.180> because<00:06:42.180> I

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
for the packaging is concerned because I

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.189 
for the packaging is concerned because I
think<00:06:42.629> it's<00:06:42.839> a<00:06:43.349> very<00:06:43.469> smart<00:06:44.009> idea<00:06:44.729> and<00:06:45.509> I

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
think it's a very smart idea and I

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.010 
think it's a very smart idea and I
haven't<00:06:46.529> really<00:06:46.800> seen<00:06:47.069> this<00:06:47.659> this<00:06:48.659> type<00:06:48.990> of

haven't really seen this this type of

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.929 
haven't really seen this this type of
case<00:06:49.379> I<00:06:49.650> mean<00:06:49.830> this<00:06:50.009> is<00:06:50.189> pretty<00:06:50.219> common<00:06:50.669> but

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
case I mean this is pretty common but

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.360 
case I mean this is pretty common but
the<00:06:51.300> whole<00:06:51.569> idea<00:06:51.599> of<00:06:51.990> using<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.529> plexiglass

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
the whole idea of using the plexiglass

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.439 
the whole idea of using the plexiglass
exterior<00:06:54.270> feels<00:06:55.189> it's<00:06:56.189> simple<00:06:56.669> but<00:06:56.699> it<00:06:56.939> looks

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
exterior feels it's simple but it looks

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.350 
exterior feels it's simple but it looks
really<00:06:57.779> fast<00:06:58.169> it<00:06:58.379> actually<00:06:58.710> does<00:07:00.740> so<00:07:02.059> yes<00:07:03.059> I'd

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
really fast it actually does so yes I'd

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.839 
really fast it actually does so yes I'd
say<00:07:04.309> it<00:07:05.309> out<00:07:05.490> of<00:07:05.639> them<00:07:05.849> but<00:07:06.089> it's<00:07:07.520> all<00:07:08.520> a<00:07:08.550> matter

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
say it out of them but it's all a matter

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.070 
say it out of them but it's all a matter
of<00:07:09.089> taste<00:07:09.389> in<00:07:09.689> them<00:07:11.389> but<00:07:12.389> I<00:07:12.449> like<00:07:12.719> to<00:07:12.749> believe

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
of taste in them but I like to believe

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:23.950 
of taste in them but I like to believe
that<00:07:13.139> I<00:07:13.439> have<00:07:13.469> a<00:07:13.949> little<00:07:14.430> bit<00:07:14.639> of<00:07:14.669> taste<00:07:19.669> so
