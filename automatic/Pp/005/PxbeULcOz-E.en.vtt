of<00:00:36.300> year<00:00:36.420> before<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.020> um<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.430> there

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of year before so um no I think there

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.979 
of year before so um no I think there
was<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> lot<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> positives<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.570> came<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.960> of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
was a lot of positives that came out of

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.060 
was a lot of positives that came out of
the<00:00:40.079> game<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:40.920> faces

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the game and I can see it in their faces

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
the game and I can see it in their faces
us<00:00:41.700> standing<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> law<00:00:42.420> chromatic<00:00:42.989> which

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
us standing in the law chromatic which

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.410 
us standing in the law chromatic which
they<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.640> haven't<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.180> need<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
they know and now we haven't we need to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420 
they know and now we haven't we need to
move<00:00:45.539> forward<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.890> take<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.309> we

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
move forward see if we can take what we

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
move forward see if we can take what we
learned<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.960> take<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.340> you<00:00:50.340> know

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
learned and take it from there you know

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
learned and take it from there you know
I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:51.000> lot<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> questions<00:00:52.079> people<00:00:52.260> ask<00:00:52.559> me

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I think a lot of questions people ask me

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.260

on<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> ball<00:00:53.160> game<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
on to the ball game is how to think and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.450 
on to the ball game is how to think and
play<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
play and I think it's really kind of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
play and I think it's really kind of
universally<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.719> would

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
universally look at it you just would

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
universally look at it you just would
watch<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.100> he<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.309> plating

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
watch all you think he just plating
