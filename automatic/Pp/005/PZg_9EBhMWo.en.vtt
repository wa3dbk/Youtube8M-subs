what<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> meant<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:19.590> idea<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.550> some

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
what is meant the idea is that some

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.720 
what is meant the idea is that some
people<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:22.320> organs<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.400> parts

about<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.550> chance<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.570> couldn't<00:00:33.989> get<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.410> AI

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
about by chance you couldn't get an AI

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.100 
about by chance you couldn't get an AI
you<00:00:35.579> couldn't<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.180> ear<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.660> couldn't<00:00:36.960> get

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
random luck and so it's very important

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.069 
random luck and so it's very important
to<00:00:43.739> understand<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.610> natural<00:00:45.450> selection<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to understand that natural selection is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.729 
to understand that natural selection is
not<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.800> random<00:00:47.789> process<00:00:48.539> natural<00:00:49.379> selection

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
not a random process natural selection

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.410 
not a random process natural selection
is<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> very<00:00:50.449> non-random<00:00:51.449> process

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
is a very non-random process

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
is a very non-random process
mutation<00:00:54.420> which<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.219> process<00:00:56.730> by<00:00:56.940> which

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
mutation which is the process by which

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540 
mutation which is the process by which
the<00:00:57.420> genetic<00:00:57.870> variation<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.649> candidates<00:00:59.250> for

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the genetic variation the candidates for

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
the genetic variation the candidates for
natural<00:00:59.879> selection<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.719> put<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.379> random

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
natural selection are put up is random

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
natural selection are put up is random
natural<00:01:02.730> selection<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.589> non-random

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
natural selection is non-random

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
natural selection is non-random
now<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.760> part<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> Darwinian<00:01:06.840> idea<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
now it's part of the Darwinian idea and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
now it's part of the Darwinian idea and
it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.799> essential<00:01:08.250> part<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's a very essential part that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.899 
it's a very essential part that
something<00:01:09.869> complicated<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.890> eye<00:01:11.159> can
