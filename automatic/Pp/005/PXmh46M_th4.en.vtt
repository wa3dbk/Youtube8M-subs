00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.210
 Goodmorning everyone 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 here I am a minecraft tutorial in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.690
 this tutorial what will I show you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.240
 here exactly I will show you a mod 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:23.939
 let's say more fashions put together to create 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.740
 a unique bike and this way there 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.070
 will allow you to insert rockets bombs 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 grenades 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.710
 we do n't have a world manga 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:46.359
 let's see tab and per capita pension 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.359
 tricks indeed made the last mode 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.359
 creative 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:01:01.330
 he was loading the world then 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.470
 under descriptions m the link to the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.550
 download of this mod 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 meanwhile let's see how it works because 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.890
 they must always be in the snow 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 but fortunately we already have a nice field 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.190
 ok let's hear each other then let's start right away 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:34.479
 first thing we see is the call 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.979
 generator the bat box and wired and covers 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.720
 since it is called notice network 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.960
 suppose it took coal 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 so let's also take the capon then 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.789
 let's think of the medical generator first 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.580
 generator we stick behind the cable that 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.350
 leads to the batting box from matt reeves 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.539
 above attached to the vault of the part 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.990
 red because the black part and the part in 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.780
 output then the encore generator 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 now we can also put jobs and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.520
 as we can see it starts to heat up 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.860
 the generator 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 once this is done we continue the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.860
 our cable and put it and take it 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.580
 lancer part 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:27.320
 the platform lancer and the control panel 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.320
 launch let's say you don't put it 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.140
 ok now let 's put our platforms 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.740
 launch behind the front one computers 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.690
 once done this you have to wait for the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.790
 discharge up to one hundred percent as the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.840
 our player gone I admit it 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.840
 nothing else for convenience 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 here's how we can see generator 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.080
 started producing energy and you are 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 filling we are the computer you are 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.739
 loading however was not insufficient then 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:14.239
 because while loading the computer 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.900
 I'll show you the grenades then gods 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.450
 grenade 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.099
 there are different types of them exactly 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.410
 Four types have degraded 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:26.330
 conventional that these are not ok 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.190
 a hole will be made 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.920
 maybe some are grenades that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.400
 throw arrows we try to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.400
 creative 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.579
 we only see in no harm because I am 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.200
 interactive also for the game 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.670
 however there are not these arrows 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.859
 fire that damage fire damage 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.969
 to the opponent then there are these le 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:53.639
 grenades which are incendiary grenades 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:58.639
 we can see and then there are these 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:03.599
 grenades that are grenades instead 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:04.319
 let's say chemicals are just look 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.180
 What are they doing 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.670
 the morning hunger poison weakness e 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.099
 nausea to cure itself just take 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.099
 antidote here 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.459
 then you should be downloaded on 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.260
 our computer 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.600
 no oh well meanwhile I say another thing about 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:30.500
 on the launch pads of an AOP 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.389
 here we need the lancer support ie 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.350
 we can launch the computer on 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.030
 rocket even so we see that there is a 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.370
 error edition block means 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.419
 were 30 blocks away 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.220
 however it will miss up to 30 blocks from the 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.039
 target we selected 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.570
 we put this one behind 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:05:01.280
 we can admit the error to 0 blocks 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:03.199
 so much so that this download is almost ok 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.789
 finished meanwhile we load unisse dei 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.470
 There are so many missiles 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.480
 we can put 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.740
 we put the first one for community 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.750
 mister conventional time 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.190
 is ready already the designated nose is the lever 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.330
 then the league serves to launch 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.599
 missiles 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.160
 now the computer is downloaded though 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.410
 you need to change coordinates because otherwise 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.060
 will not make you launch the missile since 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:34.180
 will launch it over your computer 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:38.050
 325 we put 350 and the hinge z 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:45.509
 let's omit 270 ok we launch ours 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.509
 This is why the minister is not there 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.139
 ops 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.750
 I had made a mistake 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.230
 coordinate that I could not launch 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:08.920
 ok let's see our minister 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.420
 travels and falls on our heads no oh well ok 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.680
 I arrived at the coordinates that 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.880
 I had entered and now I can 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.190
 also launch the minister of sense 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.060
 use the lever and staying away from 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.640
 precisely our missile base such as 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.440
 using the laser mark it for us 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.990
 we can put laser designated here and 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.850
 in the bat box that is being loaded e 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.160
 they just loaded our laser daisy 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.840
 m once this is done we can 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.960
 take the hall 10 m 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.450
 you will go to the computer to do frequency 1 e 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.020
 right click on our 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.750
 computer 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.520
 once this is done we could ad 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.220
 example take a goal case 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.290
 this tree right click is 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.150
 our rocket will start a singer at 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.820
 upside down so the rocket will leave 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:07:01.360
 will hit our target 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:03.190
 we see bad here and here are not 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.030
 messages have been understood 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.340
 for this tutorial everything 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.630
 I will show you the rest of fashion in the 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.160
 second 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.020
 in the second video thanks for having it 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.560
 saw my video I hope you will enjoy it 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.450
 mod 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.450
 see you in the next bye bye
