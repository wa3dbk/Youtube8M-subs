00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.679
 julien meet up for the breaking 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.360
 news about the game gta 5 and so as I 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.590
 wanted to say I'll talk about all 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.529
 main characters 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 on this new gta there are three there 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.490
 also another thing but really 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.369
 sublime we can make fingers 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.779
 of honor to passersby and yeah must 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.160
 also wait for their reactions to pasquin 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 who are you going to hit you there are some 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 who will run I do not know but do 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.439
 fingers of honor to passersby then 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 there I had to do exclusive 1 in front 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.870
 all the video I know but yeah that's 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 possible so it will be possible to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 change two characters at any time 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 when you're not going two 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.620
 apparently missions when you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.180
 change characters the camera will do 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 a zoom in the sky for then 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.500
 return to the selected character 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.600
 the main characters is called 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 michel trevor and franklin so i 'm going 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.239
 give you here basically the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 characteristics that were given 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.840
 for each of the main characters 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.039
 here present as for example michel 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.049
 the one we hear in the first 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 trailer is a bank robber live 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.090
 a tedious life and the agent texts 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 of fsb wholesale it is direct vis à vis 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 opposite screw giffard they are sometimes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 really good data is brief 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.850
 fbi haye he lives on car in Morocco 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.869
 holt equivalent to the green pv takes on 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 verdicts 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.130
 excuse me king as interesting and is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.530
 married to his wife amanda owns a 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.869
 teenage son named jimmy and a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.640
 teenage girl named after all here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 now we will go with trevor so 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.350
 very well is a friend of Michel he 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 lives in a watt trailer to blaine 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.950
 county whaou in the desert so that's like 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.509
 I told you so iris exchange 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.890
 two geographical areas ie 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.990
 that he good he lives this apparently 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.640
 in a desert where I mix happy that's 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.899
 to be unhappy for you and so by 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 example michel read it must be 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.880
 certainly not seen that it's a looter 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.830
 bank or to the campaign but it 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.960
 will be more in 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 in the city ​​center I know that step 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.160
 banks in the campaign that I know 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.080
 thank you but in the sense that good he goes 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.550
 have to flee the city a little bit so he goes 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.590
 maybe deviate in have a little to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.660
 away from banks when that would be 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 logical on his part and so we finish 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.990
 with franklin who is older in the middle 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.490
 twenties but a car salesman 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.500
 luxury is why we often saw 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.870
 screenshots pictures all 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.960
 simply two beautiful cars 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 whose audi the r8 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.140
 so basically in the game it's called 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.230
 a n 9 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.650
 f wow that's it's weird so at 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.630
 surroundings 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.180
 so they live from the beach so 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.650
 vespucci beach so it's important to 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.990
 know that each of the three characters 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 as I said before 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.350
 have their own personality as well 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.180
 that motivate their own 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.220
 motivations as well as their own 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.050
 skills still two last 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.150
 level information so cloud 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.600
 two of the main characters so 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.830
 ring mankouch so thanks to the street 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.050
 when you no longer control a 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.000
 character his life will continue and 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.740
 normally and you could be 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.269
 surprised to see in what situation he 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.160
 is located once you have taken 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.780
 character control 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.420
 so that's scary because it's at 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.310
 to say that you say good today I 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.050
 take for example michel and then tomorrow 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.090
 we'll take the treasure 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.640
 and while you have taken treasure 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.100
 michelle may have been in jail where 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.110
 we will have done bullshit 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.700
 and when you go back to the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.060
 character you go I do not know to have 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.349
 maybe d 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.870
 it may be his apartment 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.670
 completely destroyed or you are 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.400
 may have been able to see it and sail and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.560
 finally having to pay a ransom to the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 bank all that finally where for example I 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.239
 do not know the prison now it has to 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.890
 really be annoying I think I hope 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.420
 that it will not happen too often 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.890
 because it happens to annoy a little 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.300
 everyone and the last little 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.700
 beware that some characters 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.010
 so gta iv will make their comeback on 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.519
 5 gta but not like the big ones 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.660
 main characters as such as 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.450
 niko belic who was given this is true 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.920
 that's pretty bad but they can 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.030
 not put everyone too y'a pus 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.040
 it's the end of this video so it 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.660
 for all the characters of course I 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.620
 will do other very quickly the most 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.440
 quickly possible 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.900
 so that's after it will be so to propose 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.700
 gameplay and it's here so it's been 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.690
 for the main characters I hope 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.890
 that I gave you enough 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.470
 information in any case that's all 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.600
 that was given here even present one is 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.160
 the then we are in November we are 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.989
 around November 10 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.489
 so now for the moment there is only 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.590
 five years there will be other information 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.479

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.640

 just because we can make notes 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.680
 of narratively I think it's going to be 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.850
 easy to make it okay be okay 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.050
