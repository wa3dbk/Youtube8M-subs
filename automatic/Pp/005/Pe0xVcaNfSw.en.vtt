haven't<00:01:20.400> been<00:01:20.549> doing<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.560> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
haven't been doing it like at all so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
haven't been doing it like at all so
I've<00:01:22.979> really<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> been<00:01:23.759> upsetting

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I've really kind of been upsetting

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.730 
I've really kind of been upsetting
myself<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> haven't<00:01:25.170> been<00:01:25.350> doing<00:01:25.500> them

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
myself because I haven't been doing them

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
myself because I haven't been doing them
but<00:01:26.520> honestly<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.299> hit<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.509> probably

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but honestly I have not hit on probably

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
but honestly I have not hit on probably
the<00:01:27.930> last<00:01:28.049> two<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.350> three<00:01:28.500> weeks<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:30.150> be

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the last two or three weeks or so to be

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
the last two or three weeks or so to be
doing<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.229> am<00:01:31.380> lagging<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:31.860> bit

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
doing them and I am lagging a little bit

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
doing them and I am lagging a little bit
I<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.119> why<00:01:33.360> probably<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.049> i<00:01:34.140> have

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I don't know why probably because i have

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
I don't know why probably because i have
camtasia<00:01:34.710> open<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> i'm<00:01:35.520> trying<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> record

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
camtasia open and i'm trying to record

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
camtasia open and i'm trying to record
but<00:01:36.390> yep<00:01:36.540> he's<00:01:37.020> gonna<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> last<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.799> farm

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
but yep he's gonna be the last to farm

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950 
but yep he's gonna be the last to farm
runs<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> long<00:01:38.880> time<00:01:39.210> well<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> guess

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
runs for a long time well I guess

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.319 
runs for a long time well I guess
hopefully<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.619> only<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> day<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.880> really

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
hopefully for only the day I'm really

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.960 
hopefully for only the day I'm really
really<00:01:42.479> tired<00:01:42.720> I've<00:01:43.259> done<00:01:43.560> 1,500<00:01:44.460> farm<00:01:44.700> runs

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
really tired I've done 1,500 farm runs

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
really tired I've done 1,500 farm runs
since<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> start<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.720> series<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.320> believe

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
since the start of this series I believe

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800 
since the start of this series I believe
we're<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> 1500<00:01:48.240> mark<00:01:48.420> which<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.689> pretty

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
we're now the 1500 mark which is pretty

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
we're now the 1500 mark which is pretty
cool<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> we're<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.369> around<00:01:50.520> also<00:01:51.000> 10k

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
cool and we're right around also 10k

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
cool and we're right around also 10k
herbs<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.250> guess

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
herbs and I do have a little I guess

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
herbs and I do have a little I guess
your<00:01:53.909> mark<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
your mark to make and also I know I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
your mark to make and also I know I
probably<00:01:55.740> didn't<00:01:56.040> mention<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> before<00:01:56.460> or

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
probably didn't mention it before or

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
probably didn't mention it before or
maybe<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.390> did<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> previous<00:01:57.869> clip<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.860> i

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
maybe I did in the previous clip that i

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
maybe I did in the previous clip that i
will<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.670> making<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> sit<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
will be making this into a sit back and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
will be making this into a sit back and
skill<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> will<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.890> longer<00:02:02.040> after

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
skill so it will be a bit longer after

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
skill so it will be a bit longer after
I'm<00:02:02.640> done<00:02:02.820> explaining<00:02:03.570> everything<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
will be probably continuing the episode

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.570 
will be probably continuing the episode
out<00:02:11.940> too

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
out too

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.710 
out too
about<00:02:12.670> eight<00:02:12.820> or<00:02:12.850> nine<00:02:12.970> minutes<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.630> know

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
about eight or nine minutes you know

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.780 
about eight or nine minutes you know
maybe<00:02:13.930> seven<00:02:14.350> or<00:02:14.410> eight<00:02:14.530> minutes<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.670> yeah

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
maybe seven or eight minutes but yeah

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.580 
maybe seven or eight minutes but yeah
I've<00:02:15.970> really<00:02:16.180> been<00:02:16.270> falling<00:02:16.600> behind<00:02:16.720> i'm<00:02:17.410> only

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
I've really been falling behind i'm only

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.140 
I've really been falling behind i'm only
getting<00:02:17.770> busier<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.490> school<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.030> it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
getting busier because of school so it

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.610 
getting busier because of school so it
kind<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.390> sucks<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.870> I'm<00:02:20.230> not<00:02:20.350> doing

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
kind of sucks that I'm not doing

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.080 
kind of sucks that I'm not doing
coconuts<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.160> cactus<00:02:21.490> spines<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:22.060> i

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
coconuts and cactus spines because i

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.540 
coconuts and cactus spines because i
know<00:02:22.240> they<00:02:22.570> obviously<00:02:22.750> are<00:02:23.230> worth<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.490> i

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
know they obviously are worth it but i

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.300 
know they obviously are worth it but i
think<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.810> kind<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.110> cool<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.890> i'm

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
think it's kind of cool to see that i'm

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.920 
think it's kind of cool to see that i'm
still<00:02:27.610> motivated<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.090> play<00:02:28.210> runescape<00:02:28.450> it's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
still motivated to play runescape it's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.300 
still motivated to play runescape it's
just<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.170> motivated<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.800> do<00:02:29.860> farm<00:02:30.100> runs

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
just I'm not motivated to do farm runs

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.310 
just I'm not motivated to do farm runs
so<00:02:30.520> I'm<00:02:30.970> not<00:02:31.210> anywhere<00:02:31.570> near<00:02:31.630> quitting<00:02:32.170> which

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
so I'm not anywhere near quitting which

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.840 
so I'm not anywhere near quitting which
is<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> good<00:02:32.650> thing<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.160> am<00:02:33.430> kind<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.760> getting

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
is a good thing but I am kind of getting

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.970 
is a good thing but I am kind of getting
a<00:02:33.970> little<00:02:34.030> lazy<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.570> farm<00:02:34.870> runs<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.290> when<00:02:35.920> you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
a little lazy on farm runs and when you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.710 
a little lazy on farm runs and when you
think<00:02:36.190> about<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.430> when<00:02:36.610> people<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.390> 99

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
think about it when people go for 99

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.290 
think about it when people go for 99
farming<00:02:38.110> they<00:02:38.320> don't<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.770> farm<00:02:39.040> run<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.520> you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
farming they don't do farm run so you

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.700 
farming they don't do farm run so you
know<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.720> they<00:02:40.780> definitely<00:02:41.050> don't<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.440> fruit

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
know and they definitely don't do fruit

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.680 
know and they definitely don't do fruit
fruit<00:02:42.100> tree<00:02:42.370> patches<00:02:42.760> or<00:02:42.910> whatever<00:02:43.150> which

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
