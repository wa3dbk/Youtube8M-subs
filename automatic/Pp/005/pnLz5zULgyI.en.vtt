we<00:00:16.550> are<00:00:18.010> okay<00:00:19.010> we're<00:00:19.220> detecting<00:00:19.939> again<00:00:20.210> we're

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
we are okay we're detecting again we're

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.880 
we are okay we're detecting again we're
in<00:00:20.509> the<00:00:20.570> field<00:00:20.839> and<00:00:21.320> we're<00:00:21.529> at<00:00:21.589> one<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.769> our

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
in the field and we're at one of our

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.399 
in the field and we're at one of our
favorite<00:00:22.279> spots<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:22.880> we're<00:00:23.810> going<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:23.989> detect

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:24.409 
favorite spots and we're going to detect

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.710 
favorite spots and we're going to detect
for<00:00:24.679> 15-20<00:00:25.609> minutes<00:00:26.060> until<00:00:26.210> we<00:00:26.329> get<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.509> good

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
for 15-20 minutes until we get a good

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.109 
for 15-20 minutes until we get a good
reading<00:00:26.929> we<00:00:27.499> will<00:00:27.769> see<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:31.060> we've<00:00:32.060> been

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
reading we will see you we've been

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.210 
reading we will see you we've been
detecting<00:00:32.390> for<00:00:32.660> about<00:00:32.810> 20<00:00:33.350> minutes<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:34.040> got

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
detecting for about 20 minutes and I got

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.970 
detecting for about 20 minutes and I got
a<00:00:34.250> nice<00:00:34.460> deep<00:00:34.730> reading<00:00:35.000> here<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.829> I'm<00:00:36.829> going

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
a nice deep reading here and I'm going

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.470 
a nice deep reading here and I'm going
to<00:00:37.039> take<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.219> nice-sized<00:00:37.760> plug<00:00:38.059> out<00:00:38.239> like<00:00:38.390> i

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
to take a nice-sized plug out like i

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.869 
to take a nice-sized plug out like i
always<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.960> because<00:00:39.199> if<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.309> coins<00:00:40.579> laying

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
always do because if the coins laying

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.119 
always do because if the coins laying
flat<00:00:41.199> then<00:00:42.199> they'll<00:00:42.350> be<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.620> center<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:42.980> my

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
flat then they'll be in the center of my

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.209 
flat then they'll be in the center of my
whole<00:00:43.750> if<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:44.929> onto<00:00:45.230> its<00:00:45.379> side<00:00:45.559> then<00:00:46.039> it's

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
whole if it's onto its side then it's

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
whole if it's onto its side then it's
good<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.579> it's<00:00:46.730> not<00:00:46.850> going<00:00:46.969> to<00:00:47.059> be<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.179> the

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
good that it's not going to be in the

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.299 
good that it's not going to be in the
center<00:00:47.390> of<00:00:47.510> my<00:00:47.600> plug<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.500> i<00:00:48.530> always<00:00:48.920> take<00:00:49.250> a

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
center of my plug so i always take a

00:00:49.309 --> 00:01:06.680 
center of my plug so i always take a
good<00:00:49.579> sized<00:00:49.760> plug<00:00:50.030> out

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.110 

so<00:01:07.690> I've<00:01:07.750> got<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:07.930> plug<00:01:08.200> out<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.909> I'm<00:01:09.970> going

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
so I've got the plug out what I'm going

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.950 
so I've got the plug out what I'm going
to<00:01:10.150> do<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.450> uh<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:13.210> these<00:01:13.360> multi<00:01:13.720> frequency

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
to do is uh with these multi frequency

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.000 
to do is uh with these multi frequency
machines<00:01:14.620> like<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.979> xcal<00:01:15.760> like<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.300> minelab

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
machines like the xcal like the minelab

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.700 
machines like the xcal like the minelab
I'm<00:01:18.010> going<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.670> take<00:01:19.659> this<00:01:19.810> pistol<00:01:20.050> probe<00:01:20.440> and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
I'm going to take this pistol probe and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.249 
I'm going to take this pistol probe and
I'm<00:01:20.830> going<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.250> adjust<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.760> frequency<00:01:22.690> on<00:01:23.140> it

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
I'm going to adjust the frequency on it

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.560 
I'm going to adjust the frequency on it
so<00:01:23.380> there's<00:01:23.590> no<00:01:24.060> interference<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.360> how<00:01:25.509> you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
so there's no interference and how you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.380 
so there's no interference and how you
do<00:01:25.750> that<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.340> basically<00:01:27.340> press<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.970> button<00:01:28.270> in

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
do that is basically press the button in

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.210 
do that is basically press the button in
and<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.990> adjust<00:01:29.380> your<00:01:29.440> frequency<00:01:30.009> very

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and you adjust your frequency very

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.249 
and you adjust your frequency very
slightly<00:01:30.610> until<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.660> interference<00:01:32.110> goes

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
slightly until the interference goes

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.900 
slightly until the interference goes
away<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.530> let<00:01:32.800> me<00:01:32.860> do<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.100> now<00:01:33.310> show<00:01:33.759> you<00:01:33.820> how

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
away so let me do that now show you how

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.380 
away so let me do that now show you how
easy<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.869> hear<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.140> chatter<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.240> what

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
easy it is you hear the chatter so what

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.540 
easy it is you hear the chatter so what
I'm<00:01:40.450> going<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.630> do<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.869> just<00:01:41.470> want<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.490> adjust

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
I'm going to do is just want to adjust

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.389 
I'm going to do is just want to adjust
the<00:01:42.910> frequency<00:01:43.119> until<00:01:43.720> stops<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:45.100> I'm<00:01:45.190> ready

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
the frequency until stops now I'm ready

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.310 
the frequency until stops now I'm ready
to<00:01:45.430> use<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.970> pistol<00:01:46.149> probe<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.960> locate<00:01:47.289> my

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
to use the pistol probe to locate my

00:01:47.320 --> 00:02:01.290 
to use the pistol probe to locate my
target<00:01:58.410> I'm<00:01:59.410> a<00:01:59.500> little<00:01:59.740> off<00:01:59.860> center<00:02:00.300> that's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
target I'm a little off center that's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.180 
target I'm a little off center that's
why<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.539> dig<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.810> big<00:02:02.050> hole<00:02:02.080> cuz<00:02:02.530> I'm<00:02:02.619> off<00:02:02.770> center

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
why I dig a big hole cuz I'm off center

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.680 
why I dig a big hole cuz I'm off center
but<00:02:03.310> I'm<00:02:03.460> certainly<00:02:03.759> getting<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.149> target<00:02:04.509> now

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
but I'm certainly getting the target now

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.499 
but I'm certainly getting the target now
and<00:02:05.560> I'm<00:02:05.679> probably<00:02:05.950> down<00:02:06.340> I'm<00:02:06.670> safe<00:02:07.090> about

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
and I'm probably down I'm safe about

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.150 
and I'm probably down I'm safe about
four<00:02:07.720> inches<00:02:07.960> down<00:02:08.110> already<00:02:08.380> three<00:02:08.649> for<00:02:09.009> at

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
four inches down already three for at

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.070 
four inches down already three for at
least<00:02:09.250> four<00:02:09.489> inches<00:02:09.519> down<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.479> I'm<00:02:10.570> off-center

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
least four inches down so I'm off-center

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
least four inches down so I'm off-center
I'm<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.350> dig<00:02:11.590> out<00:02:12.390> until<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.660> a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
I'm going to dig out until I get a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.170 
I'm going to dig out until I get a
little<00:02:13.870> deeper<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:15.430> I'll<00:02:15.549> stick<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.850> pistol

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
little deeper then I'll stick the pistol

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.850 
little deeper then I'll stick the pistol
probe<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.019> can<00:02:17.230> locate<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
probe in and see if I can locate it you

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.220 
probe in and see if I can locate it you
can<00:02:23.980> hear<00:02:24.190> how<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.400> pistol<00:02:24.880> probe<00:02:25.090> gets<00:02:25.329> more

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
can hear how the pistol probe gets more

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.930 
can hear how the pistol probe gets more
distinct<00:02:26.620> when<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.860> get<00:02:27.400> closer<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.850> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
distinct when you get closer to the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.850 
distinct when you get closer to the
target<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.420> I'm<00:02:28.540> basically<00:02:29.110> dead<00:02:29.560> center

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
target so I'm basically dead center

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.160 
target so I'm basically dead center
right<00:02:29.980> now<00:02:33.780> sure<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.420> let's<00:02:37.600> see<00:02:37.780> what<00:02:37.900> we<00:02:37.989> got

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
right now sure so let's see what we got

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.830 
right now sure so let's see what we got
we're<00:02:38.380> close

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.270 

get<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:46.930> hand<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:49.830> y'all<00:02:50.830> get<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.069> closer

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
get my hand in here y'all get it closer
