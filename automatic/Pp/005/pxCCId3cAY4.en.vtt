00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
awesome so the main thing i really like
about<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.580> game<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.630> feels<00:00:27.930> different

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
about this game is it it feels different

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.640 
about this game is it it feels different
from<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.920> other<00:00:29.039> Cod's<00:00:29.570> this<00:00:30.570> call<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.349> duty

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
from the other Cod's this call of duty

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.190 
from the other Cod's this call of duty
is<00:00:32.059> definitely<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.270> weirdest<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.020> when<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
is definitely the weirdest one when it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
is definitely the weirdest one when it
comes<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.399> different<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
comes to like it's different it's the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.490 
comes to like it's different it's the
most<00:00:36.420> different<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.200> all<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.350> them

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
most different one out of all of them

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.700 
most different one out of all of them
still<00:00:38.100> call<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> duty<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.230> way<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> guns

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
still call of duty but the way the guns

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
still call of duty but the way the guns
in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> perks<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> perk<00:00:41.910> balance<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
in the perks are the perk balance is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.850 
in the perks are the perk balance is
pretty<00:00:42.840> crazy<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.680> actually

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
pretty crazy like when you actually

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
pretty crazy like when you actually
create<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.430> character<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.660> different<00:00:46.289> from

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
create a character it's different from

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.279 
create a character it's different from
your<00:00:46.980> other<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.789> other<00:00:47.940> classes<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:49.140> when

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
your other your other classes like when

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.819 
your other your other classes like when
you<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.910> like<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.090> brushing<00:00:51.660> class<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.260> way

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you make a like my brushing class is way

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.580 
you make a like my brushing class is way
different<00:00:53.430> than<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:54.059> defensive<00:00:54.719> camp<00:00:55.379> or

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
different than my defensive camp or

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.520 
different than my defensive camp or
class<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:56.100> I'm<00:00:56.219> playing<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.670> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
scavenger and fully loaded fully loaded

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.380 
scavenger and fully loaded fully loaded
as<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> park<00:01:23.549> where<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.729> start<00:01:23.939> off<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.180> max

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
as a park where you start off with max

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.640 
as a park where you start off with max
ammo<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.259> along<00:01:25.619> with

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
ammo and I have that along with

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
ammo and I have that along with
scavenger<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> literally<00:01:27.360> never<00:01:27.570> run<00:01:27.750> on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
scavenger so I literally never run on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.090 
scavenger so I literally never run on
ammo<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
ammo and I really like that because I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
ammo and I really like that because I
don't<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.520> cater<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.450> play<00:01:30.659> style<00:01:30.930> around

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
