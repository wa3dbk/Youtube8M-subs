00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.260 
that side put this aside now get this
cable<00:02:10.640> here<00:02:10.670> okay<00:02:11.230> as<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.320> can<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:13.270> now

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
cable here okay as you can see here now

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.420 
cable here okay as you can see here now
normally<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.020> cable<00:02:16.660> will<00:02:17.660> show<00:02:17.930> you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
normally this cable will show you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.550 
normally this cable will show you
exactly<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:22.280> ps4<00:02:23.000> logo<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.690> all<00:02:24.170> right

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
exactly the ps4 logo on it all right

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.830 
exactly the ps4 logo on it all right
at<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.550> same<00:02:25.730> time<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.420> will<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.660> see<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
at the same time you will just see the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.930 
at the same time you will just see the
difference<00:02:27.320> all<00:02:27.530> right<00:02:27.710> that<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.550> this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
difference all right that this this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.990 
difference all right that this this
sometimes<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.950> cable<00:02:30.950> don't<00:02:31.100> work<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.700> half

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
sometimes this cable don't work or half

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.190 
sometimes this cable don't work or half
the<00:02:32.180> times<00:02:32.390> when<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.080> get<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.350> along<00:02:33.980> work<00:02:34.190> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the times when you get it along work and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.230 
the times when you get it along work and
also<00:02:36.200> when<00:02:36.470> put<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:36.710> charge<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.000> see

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
also when put in charge is that you see

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.230 
also when put in charge is that you see
that<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.540> will<00:02:38.660> charge<00:02:38.960> us<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.920> lot<00:02:40.520> slower<00:02:40.910> than

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
that it will charge us a lot slower than

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.360 
that it will charge us a lot slower than
the<00:02:41.510> original<00:02:42.050> one<00:02:42.170> because<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.950> original<00:02:43.160> is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
the original one because the original is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.070 
the original one because the original is
made<00:02:43.760> we've<00:02:43.910> all<00:02:44.060> written<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.600> original

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
made we've all written the original

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.340 
made we've all written the original
cables<00:02:45.500> etc<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.580> fake<00:02:46.790> cable<00:02:47.350> no

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
cables etc this is the fake cable no

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.930 
cables etc this is the fake cable no
original<00:02:48.860> not<00:02:49.010> branded<00:02:49.430> or<00:02:49.520> nothing

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
original not branded or nothing

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.360 
original not branded or nothing
okay<00:02:50.930> now<00:02:51.470> when<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.740> take<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.010> out<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.250> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
okay now when you take this out of the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.700 
okay now when you take this out of the
cable<00:02:52.790> box<00:02:53.150> okay<00:02:53.750> that's<00:02:54.020> where<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
cable box okay that's where the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.730 
cable box okay that's where the
difficult<00:02:55.190> bit<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:55.850> because<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:57.290> don't<00:02:57.530> see

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
difficult bit is because you don't see

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.620 
difficult bit is because you don't see
anything<00:02:58.070> difference<00:02:58.700> all<00:02:59.300> right

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
anything difference all right

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.060 
anything difference all right
maybe<00:02:59.840> one<00:03:00.200> or<00:03:00.230> two<00:03:00.350> things<00:03:00.710> which<00:03:00.830> I'm<00:03:00.950> going

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
maybe one or two things which I'm going

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.340 
maybe one or two things which I'm going
to<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.250> through<00:03:01.520> all<00:03:01.970> right<00:03:02.120> look<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.290> a

it's a Sony model see you hate that -
Zed<00:03:30.890> ct1<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.989> wireless<00:03:32.989> controller<00:03:33.410> all

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
Zed ct1 you wireless controller all

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.160 
Zed ct1 you wireless controller all
right<00:03:34.400> he<00:03:34.850> has<00:03:35.000> anything<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.570> can<00:03:35.750> think<00:03:35.959> of

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
right he has anything you can think of

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.590 
right he has anything you can think of
all<00:03:36.440> right<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:36.800> it's<00:03:37.070> very<00:03:37.459> very<00:03:37.940> difficult<00:03:38.239> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
all right so it's very very difficult to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.560 
all right so it's very very difficult to
actually<00:03:38.630> realize<00:03:39.350> if<00:03:39.739> this<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.330> genuine<00:03:41.330> or

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
actually realize if this is a genuine or

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.150 
actually realize if this is a genuine or
a<00:03:41.600> fake<00:03:41.989> one<00:03:42.230> all<00:03:43.070> right<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.830> can<00:03:46.040> see

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
a fake one all right now you can see

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.530 
a fake one all right now you can see
that<00:03:46.310> look<00:03:46.459> that's<00:03:46.730> actually<00:03:47.090> flashing<00:03:47.420> as

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that look that's actually flashing as

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.260 
that look that's actually flashing as
well<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.140> it's<00:03:48.440> more<00:03:48.860> difficult<00:03:49.070> now<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.000> only

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
well so it's more difficult now the only

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.940 
well so it's more difficult now the only
way<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.480> actually<00:03:50.720> find<00:03:50.959> out<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.470> if<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.739> is

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
way to actually find out that if this is

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.530 
way to actually find out that if this is
a<00:03:52.570> fake<00:03:53.890> controller<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.520> when<00:03:56.450> you

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
a fake controller is that is when you

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.030 
a fake controller is that is when you
start<00:03:56.840> playing<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.320> now<00:03:57.500> when<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.830> start

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
start playing it now when you start

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.560 
start playing it now when you start
playing<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.520> know<00:03:58.760> you've<00:03:59.060> probably<00:03:59.209> seen

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
playing you know you've probably seen

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.650 
playing you know you've probably seen
about<00:03:59.840> from<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.110> ps3<00:04:00.470> controller<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
about from the ps3 controller that the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.780 
about from the ps3 controller that the
origin<00:04:03.080> one<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.440> very<00:04:03.709> smooth<00:04:04.040> analog<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.610> very

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
origin one is very smooth analog is very

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.150 
origin one is very smooth analog is very
smooth<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.510> use<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:06.170> bands<00:04:06.500> are<00:04:06.680> very<00:04:06.709> smooth

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
smooth to use that bands are very smooth

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.900 
smooth to use that bands are very smooth
to<00:04:07.310> use<00:04:07.519> but<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.600> main<00:04:08.810> problem<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.380> that<00:04:09.910> when

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
to use but the main problem is that when

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.730 
to use but the main problem is that when
you<00:04:10.940> sometimes<00:04:11.299> press<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.720> button

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
you sometimes press the button

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.890 
you sometimes press the button
I<00:04:12.770> have<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.190> pursue<00:04:13.460> more<00:04:14.060> like<00:04:14.360> pressure<00:04:14.630> to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
I have to pursue more like pressure to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.380 
I have to pursue more like pressure to

actually make it work and the charging

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.430 
actually make it work and the charging
just<00:04:37.190> takes<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.460> little<00:04:37.550> bit<00:04:37.670> longer<00:04:37.850> now<00:04:38.440> this

difficult to actually realize so these

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.370 
difficult to actually realize so these
are<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> few<00:04:47.240> points<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.630> we<00:04:47.870> find<00:04:48.140> out<00:04:48.290> if

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
are the few points that we find out if

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.090 
are the few points that we find out if
it's<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.590> fake<00:04:48.770> mop

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100
