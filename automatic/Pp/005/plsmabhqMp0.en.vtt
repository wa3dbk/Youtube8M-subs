00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hi people 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.750
 today I came to talk about one of the subjects 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 more controversial than most 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.220
 smart girl on facebook 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
 I know you love our videos and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 our posts about hair when 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 yarn growth then 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 What are you two days to know, huh? 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.750
 but today I came here just to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 tell you that there is not one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.820
 magic formula unfortunately does not exist 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 something that we can do that has a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.660
 the best and best hair 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.239
 begins to grow but with some care 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.100
 on a day-to-day basis such as a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.770
 balanced feed 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.960
 coupled with the care we already have 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.579
 with hair with specific products 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 for our hair type for each 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 problem that it is because it presents 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 we can have healthy hair and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.360
 recovered to those who believe that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.399
 food does not influence the hair but 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 I assure you that we 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 It's really what we eat does not have 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.850
 how do we feed each other in a way 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.280
 to be totally displeased and that is 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.220
 the new hair looks healthy beautiful 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960
 glowing only with these treatments 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 that we usually do at home with the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.970
 even if the products are of excellent 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530
 quality and 50% at least is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 responsibility for good nutrition 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 allied to physical exercises is a routine 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.140
 healthy because our hair it 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 need vitamins and minerals 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.549
 essential elements that strengthen 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.619
 responsible for brightness and even 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 the thickness of your hair is always 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.100
 leave the calcium when this mineral 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.329
 inserted below the quantities 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.490
 suitable 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.049
 the new hair becomes easier it also has 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.590
 the thinner I knew it 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.840
 since we're talking about yourself 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.960
 it is easily found in milk in the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.240
 derived from salmon and also from sardines 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.170
 so you already include this in your 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.509
 food 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.810
 you can be sure that your hair is already going 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.060
 start to improve gradually 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.159
 you can see that these 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.590
 these super restrictive diets 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.979
 poor in minerals and vitamins 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.410
 they totally damage the hair and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.970
 nails and of course our body I also say 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.599
 hair and nails because they are the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.540
 first to feel this deficiency 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.329
 lack of nutrients is caused by 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.220
 this poor diet as is faro 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.480
 proved that if we change our habits 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 food 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.549
 our body will feel like this 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.349
 both negatively and positively 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.640
 depends on what you will choose in 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.829
 manage your day to day 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.190
 I will give an example here of a mineral the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.720
 magnesium which is very important for 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.489
 the health of the hair since it is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.709
 responsible for protein formation. 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.690
 our hair and hair people know it is 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.799
 pure protein or magnesium you can 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 count on the seafood on us in the grapes 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.910
 fruits such as pineapple melon pineapple and 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.739
 you are here in a summarized way 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.200
 some foods that will help you have 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.359
 a healthier, more beautiful hair like 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.139
 for example I think we highlighted 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.880
 we have the fruit of the sea the fruits of the sea 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.680
 lean meats the liver is a 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.980
 excellent, I really like it then 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.430
 I'd rather opt for the other meats 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.730
 have thin banana oil seeds that 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.569
 are the macadamia nut and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.560
 there goes 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.480
 o was the other guti spinach is derived 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.090
 the milk itself 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.069
 green leaves lentils and beans 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.630
 also great options I close the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.430
 socialist society emphasizing the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.220
 stimulates yarn growth and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.019
 carrot that also helps in nutrition with 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.169
