00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
we want the background to be red so that

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.149 
we want the background to be red so that
pizza<00:01:55.810> jon<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.439> red<00:01:56.590> background<00:01:59.159> so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
pizza jon is on the red background so

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.050 
pizza jon is on the red background so
our<00:02:00.490> basic<00:02:01.240> pizza<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.740> done<00:02:03.130> or<00:02:03.520> about<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.909> put

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
it in the oven so far what I've learned

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.740 
it in the oven so far what I've learned
because<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.490> show<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.700> called<00:02:07.090> Karen<00:02:07.509> learns

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
because the show is called Karen learns

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.259 
because the show is called Karen learns
to<00:02:07.929> cut<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> piece<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.250> pizza<00:02:09.519> is<00:02:10.209> not

as<00:02:10.720> difficult<00:02:10.750> as<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.560> thought<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.860> would<00:02:11.890> be

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
as difficult as I thought it would be

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.740 
as difficult as I thought it would be
there's<00:02:12.430> basically<00:02:12.610> three<00:02:12.790> ingredients<00:02:13.120> all

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
there's basically three ingredients all

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.870 
there's basically three ingredients all
in<00:02:13.930> which<00:02:14.049> we<00:02:14.230> just<00:02:14.410> bothered<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.830> story<00:02:15.069> good

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
in which we just bothered the story good

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.600 
in which we just bothered the story good
let's<00:02:16.360> let's<00:02:16.810> open<00:02:17.049> this<00:02:17.380> how<00:02:17.860> old<00:02:18.130> yes<00:02:18.370> what's

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
let's let's open this how old yes what's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.539 
let's let's open this how old yes what's
up<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.569> we<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.560> cheese<00:02:23.920> but

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
up in it so we we have this cheese but

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.340 
up in it so we we have this cheese but
it's<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.819> little<00:02:25.120> bit<00:02:25.299> big<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.810> get<00:02:26.019> all<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
it's a little bit big to get all the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.770 
it's a little bit big to get all the
detail<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:26.769> we<00:02:27.040> want<00:02:27.250> for<00:02:27.549> pizzas<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.540> we

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
detail that we want for pizzas on so we

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.699

are going to put it in the food

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.970 
are going to put it in the food
processor<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.850> it's<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.180> lot<00:02:31.420> smaller

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
processor so that it's a lot smaller

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.620 
processor so that it's a lot smaller
particles<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> truly

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
about to put the final finishing touch

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.220 
about to put the final finishing touch
which<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.920> piece<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.820> time<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.750> cut<00:03:12.080> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
which is piece of time so I cut the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.500 
which is piece of time so I cut the
stencil<00:03:12.710> I'll<00:03:13.040> cry<00:03:13.610> stuck<00:03:13.940> I'll<00:03:14.210> hold<00:03:14.330> it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
stencil I'll cry stuck I'll hold it

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.910 
stencil I'll cry stuck I'll hold it
against<00:03:14.900> me<00:03:14.960> so<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.500> can<00:03:15.650> actually<00:03:15.740> see

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
against me so that you can actually see

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920 
against me so that you can actually see
it<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.460> we're<00:03:17.330> just<00:03:17.450> going<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.600> lay<00:03:17.750> them<00:03:17.810> on

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
it and we're just going to lay them on

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.610 
it and we're just going to lay them on
top<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:18.860> sprinkle<00:03:19.460> cheese<00:03:20.330> on<00:03:21.260> top<00:03:21.440> of

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
top and then sprinkle cheese on top of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620 
top and then sprinkle cheese on top of
it<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:21.980> hopefully<00:03:22.520> we're<00:03:23.120> going<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.330> end<00:03:23.480> up

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
it and hopefully we're going to end up

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.680 
it and hopefully we're going to end up
with<00:03:24.020> in<00:03:24.470> theory<00:03:24.860> will<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.940> pizza<00:03:26.390> John

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
with in theory will have a pizza John

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.390 
with in theory will have a pizza John
pizza<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.470> might<00:03:27.590> look<00:03:27.710> slightly<00:03:27.890> deformed

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
pizza it might look slightly deformed

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.430 
pizza it might look slightly deformed
but<00:03:28.640> we'll<00:03:28.790> see<00:03:28.910> how<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.060> turns<00:03:29.180> out<00:03:29.510> let's

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
but we'll see how it turns out let's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:51.509 
but we'll see how it turns out let's
give<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.770> try

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.850

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
pizza it actually wasn't that hard

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.480 
pizza it actually wasn't that hard
although<00:04:36.150> my<00:04:36.600> stencil<00:04:37.170> is<00:04:37.470> pretty<00:04:38.310> much

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
although my stencil is pretty much

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.550 
although my stencil is pretty much
ruined<00:04:38.910> by<00:04:39.090> now<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.930> guess<00:04:40.050> I<00:04:40.260> just<00:04:40.290> have<00:04:40.530> to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.470 
ruined by now so I guess I just have to
make<00:04:40.770> more<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.340> then<00:04:41.550> make<00:04:41.760> all<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:41.970> my<00:04:42.240> food
