00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
than mental stuff than anything we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.520

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
know somebody the spring will step up

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.429 
know somebody the spring will step up
and<00:03:10.400> show<00:03:10.700> us<00:03:11.120> they<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.689> we<00:03:12.290> were

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
and show us they can do it we were

and show us they can do it we were
playing<00:03:12.680> for<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> water<00:03:13.459> back<00:03:13.609> spring<00:03:14.620> will

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
playing for the water back spring will

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.979 
playing for the water back spring will
rotate<00:03:16.069> them<00:03:16.220> through<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.909> know<00:03:17.000> will<00:03:17.750> kind

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
rotate them through you know will kind

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.539 
rotate them through you know will kind
of<00:03:18.019> get<00:03:18.109> a<00:03:18.170> four-man<00:03:18.620> rotation<00:03:18.799> here<00:03:19.280> for<00:03:19.489> a

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
of get a four-man rotation here for a

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.099 
of get a four-man rotation here for a
while<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:19.909> it<00:03:20.030> won't<00:03:20.180> be<00:03:20.269> too<00:03:20.510> long<00:03:20.540> before<00:03:20.750> we

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
while but it won't be too long before we

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.960 
while but it won't be too long before we
start<00:03:21.319> pushing<00:03:21.650> two<00:03:22.189> guys<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.609> most<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:22.909> the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
start pushing two guys with most of the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.879 
start pushing two guys with most of the
reps<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.900> want<00:03:24.139> to<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.349> a<00:03:24.379> stronger<00:03:24.680> by<00:03:24.859> the

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
reps you want to have a stronger by the

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.250 
reps you want to have a stronger by the
unit<00:03:25.189> spring-like<00:03:25.700> going<00:03:25.939> over<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:27.079> we'll

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
unit spring-like going over and we'll

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.809 
unit spring-like going over and we'll
see<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.650> mean<00:03:27.829> if<00:03:27.920> one<00:03:28.040> guy<00:03:28.159> really<00:03:28.340> separates
