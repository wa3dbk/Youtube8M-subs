00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
think it was just his little of sacred

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.279 
think it was just his little of sacred
shield<00:05:01.789> or<00:05:02.000> whatever<00:05:02.270> because<00:05:02.900> it's

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
shield or whatever because it's

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.020 
shield or whatever because it's
absorbing<00:05:03.710> instead<00:05:04.009> of<00:05:04.099> immune<00:05:04.340> so<00:05:04.669> whatever

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
absorbing instead of immune so whatever

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.480
