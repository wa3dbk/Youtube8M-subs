00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
easy it is to do the API right there you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.679 
easy it is to do the API right there you
can<00:02:05.700> pick<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> server<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.270> want<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.630> would

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
just to auto detect it usually works

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
just to auto detect it usually works
pretty<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.940> that's<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:09.869> easy
