00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 for the house how they are welcome once 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.150
 more time to my channel today I bring to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.990
 you a new video and this week is 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.150
 a video as a decoration I made a 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.559
 good video in fact are two videos what 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 what's happening is that I think it's going to come out 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.510
 soon as very long are going to be two 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.300
 you tidy the requirements two objects that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.160
 we can make them economic that they do not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.750
 they are going to cost us a lot of money but 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 if you want to see how I do the first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410
 object that are beautiful flowers of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.900
 wool that they give to see the video until the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.090
 final and good to start obviously 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.239
 you need wool in the colors that you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.700
 choose chus sticks or a gun 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.030
 hot silicone a florerito and some 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 scissors you're going to take three fingers of your 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.670
 hand or an object that has more or less 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 the same width and you're going to start 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.559
 roll the wool in this object or in your 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 fingers 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 I had about 60 laps 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 and then I cut a bit to tie 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.359
 this little ball in half once the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.359
 will take out of the box 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.960
 remember that you must tie the very well 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 with double triple knots whatever as 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.910
 you want and you're going to have something like this 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 lacito that soon you are going to cut everything 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.170
 around so that you have something like 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 this and I'm crushing it because 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
 I want to see what are the little hairs that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.980
 they are longer than others and start 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.170
 outline all of them and leave more or 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.030
 less of the same length however a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.820
 once I shook it I saw that there were some more 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.280
 long and I cut again all those that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.810
 they were not even and that's how my 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.299
 pom pom ball 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.369
 what I do is look for the center of the 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.200
 ball put a point of silicone and 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.670
 stick the spell stick so that 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.670
 our little flower is ready 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.850
 I made flowers of various colors 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.859
 good of three colors that were the ones 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.259
 I liked more and then just 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:04.299
 I had to put it in my little flower 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.299
 look for a place in an office 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.039
 and that's how my new desk looks 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.750
 and good as they could see are quite 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.910
 the only thing is that if they require 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.920
 a little bit of time and suddenly like a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.780
 little skill in handling wool 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.239
 that we do not get messed up in what we have left 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.640
 as well uniform it seems that they look 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.580
 super super cute in a room 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.170
 girls is beautiful for your home to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.500
 the room you can use suddenly other 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.870
 colors you can put it in some vases 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.670
 separated each one so if you liked it 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.519
 this video I hope you finger them up 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 and share it with whomever you want 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.450

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.489
