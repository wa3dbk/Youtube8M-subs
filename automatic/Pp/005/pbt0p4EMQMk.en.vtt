00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.050
 the last world came with the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.629
 Hope to do things well because 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.820
 they just won the euro and everyone the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.100
 I saw very solid but it will be the big step 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.230
 Once you take that step, people wait 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.910
 that they can repeat yes good always 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.650
 you have the illusion of being able to repeat 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.780
 be able to do work before as you said 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.030
 obviously the scenarios change is 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.470
 totally different we know that it's going to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.820
 being is very difficult because also what 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.589
 we live in the confederations with 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
 selections that are very strong as 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.790
 brazil argentinas to include many 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.070
 favorite what there are also European and 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.660
 good we go with that illusion and those desires 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.580
 to go step by step to be able to do it well 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.470
 to repeat something great the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.330
 selection of good chile well you know 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.580
 well alexis logically but has had 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.320
 a very important growth like 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.240
 facing a team like chile are a 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.160
 very aggressive team that will not let you 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.420
 think they are over then you have great 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.910
 players like so badly done and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.890
 as vidal and many others and good is going to 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.450
 be a very complicated selection and 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.860
 difficult is it true that they then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.300
 They are also very excited and many 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.039
 you win and have made a very compact team 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.810
 and solid and surely they will be 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.520
 fighting to pass the next rumba I 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.349
 I think the obligation is to stay 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.030
 first of the group because Brazil 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.159
 surely the group will be first 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.320
 and avoid that crossing to the instances 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.760
 obviously we are going to look for the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.350
 first place but most important 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.479
 always as I always say it is to continue 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 advancing and as you said you Brazil is 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.940
 a very strong selection for 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.460
 players who have because they play in 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.869
 home I think it would be nice to be able 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.130
 avoid it but if it touches us then we have 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.530
 to face them and try 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.810
 overcome them finally within the field 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.460
 it does not matter if you're tired 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.409
 you're tired if you saw the family not 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.660
 you saw it there what is expected of you what 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.789
 you have to give and it's like a shield 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.459
 it's total isolation you have to 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.930
 concentrate only on what you are 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.120
 doing I think that also the occasion what 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.830
 it deserves because it is a world cup because they are 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.420
 unique unrepeatable moments that will not 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.820
 Live again practically in your 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.260
 career to live it intensely and 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.700
 stay with this experience because I 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.209
 I think that for the future for me it will be 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.209
 beautiful
