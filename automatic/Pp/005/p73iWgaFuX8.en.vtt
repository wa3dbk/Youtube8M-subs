00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello everyone we are barbara we are 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.360
 in the workshop of the put the jacket 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 themes that is a training story for 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.190
 professional bartenders what we will go 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 to see today is mixing 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.170
 molecular what is mixing 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 molecular is a science that studies i 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.220
 physical and chemical changes that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.580
 occur in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.789
 it burns liquids and they happen 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.809
 through the addition of additives 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.900
 today we're going to see the sanitization 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.630
 of margarita loans e 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.610
 we will use a product that agar 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.640
 agar is a brown south algae 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.170
 asian e 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.320
 while the ingredients we go to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 use will be 35 billion queen in the 600s 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.020
 mld blue curaÃ§ao and I thought it's done with 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.770
 line and water to fill the product 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.899
 lager 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.910
 we will have to go and melt it 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.280
 inside the liquid sugar up 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.739
 to bring it to a boil 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.440
 we put 40 mils of sugar 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.450
 liquid in a saucepan on the stove e 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.780
 let's add the race a lot 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.820
 slowly we dust it over and 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.030
 we turn the mixture up to take it to 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 boiling 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:29.030
 when it comes to boiling we leave it like this 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.850
 in this state for a 12 minute to do 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.520
 so that it acts wide once 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.600
 that thickens we can remain the cross 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.500
 because we have prepared ourselves 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.500
 previously 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.930
 and let's mix it all up now 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.700
 we can put inside the lemon 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.979
 and let cool 20 minutes 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.369
 roughly inside the fridge and I have to 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.110
 say will have to come out solidified on 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.170
 the result obtained is this there is a 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.900
 lemon that we will then cut first 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.070
 half and we're going to do then stick e 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.170
 make some slices of it 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.209
 we must be careful when we go to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.989
 cut the jelly because we could 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.970
 break it if you want to become you too 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.040
 of molecular professionals 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.410
 come and visit my academy street 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.410
