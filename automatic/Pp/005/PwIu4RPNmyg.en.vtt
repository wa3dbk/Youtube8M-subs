00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
to achieve and the clay body that I'm

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.940 
to achieve and the clay body that I'm
glazing<00:04:48.330> one<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.420> the<00:04:49.510> fun<00:04:49.750> things<00:04:49.780> about<00:04:50.470> the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
glazing one of the fun things about the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.820 
glazing one of the fun things about the
glazing<00:04:51.430> process<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:52.560> especially<00:04:53.560> with<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
glazing process is especially with the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.710 
glazing process is especially with the
high<00:04:54.010> fire<00:04:54.280> glazes<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:54.820> using<00:04:55.330> them<00:04:55.480> as

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
high fire glazes and using them as

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.770 
high fire glazes and using them as
homeless<00:04:56.710> as<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.890> paint<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.820> fact<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.240> the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
homeless as a paint is the fact that the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.480 
homeless as a paint is the fact that the
results<00:04:58.960> are<00:04:59.350> so<00:04:59.680> dramatically<00:05:00.250> different

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
results are so dramatically different

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.850 
results are so dramatically different
when<00:05:00.790> you're<00:05:00.910> done<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:02.590> know<00:05:02.710> these

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
when you're done and you know these

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.450 
when you're done and you know these
muted<00:05:03.340> landscapes<00:05:04.120> end<00:05:04.600> up<00:05:05.290> being<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:06.160> bright

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
muted landscapes end up being so bright

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.500 
muted landscapes end up being so bright
and<00:05:06.730> colorful

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
and colorful

I'm<00:05:09.350> going<00:05:09.710> in<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:10.100> doing<00:05:10.160> some<00:05:10.730> detail<00:05:11.270> work

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
I'm going in and doing some detail work

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.860 
I'm going in and doing some detail work
I<00:05:11.930> like<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.770> leave<00:05:13.130> some<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.790> clay<00:05:14.090> exposed

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
I like to leave some of the clay exposed

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.360 
I like to leave some of the clay exposed
and<00:05:15.380> use<00:05:16.060> oxides<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:18.050> fill<00:05:18.500> in<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.830> areas<00:05:19.220> to

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
and use oxides to fill in the areas to

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.520 
and use oxides to fill in the areas to
create<00:05:19.730> depth<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.390> dimension<00:05:20.630> on<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.260> pieces

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
create depth and dimension on the pieces

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.680 
create depth and dimension on the pieces
on<00:05:22.130> this<00:05:22.370> piece<00:05:22.640> I'm<00:05:22.790> going<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:22.970> be<00:05:23.090> using<00:05:23.270> some

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
on this piece I'm going to be using some

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.020 
on this piece I'm going to be using some
red<00:05:24.470> iron<00:05:24.800> oxide

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
red iron oxide

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.690 
red iron oxide
I<00:05:26.060> used<00:05:26.600> almost<00:05:27.020> in<00:05:27.200> a<00:05:27.290> watercolor<00:05:27.920> type<00:05:28.520> of

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
I used almost in a watercolor type of

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.120 
I used almost in a watercolor type of
fashion<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:29.990> just<00:05:30.290> washed<00:05:30.590> through<00:05:31.010> the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
fashion and I just washed through the

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.580 
fashion and I just washed through the
area<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:32.050> will<00:05:33.050> also<00:05:33.350> use<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:34.510> manganese<00:05:35.590> which

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
area I will also use a manganese which

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.660 
area I will also use a manganese which
will<00:05:36.770> give<00:05:36.980> it<00:05:37.010> a<00:05:37.310> deeper<00:05:37.910> color<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:40.190> glazes

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
will give it a deeper color the glazes

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.690 
will give it a deeper color the glazes

the clay when they're fired they tended

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.560 
the clay when they're fired they tended
to<00:05:53.420> work<00:05:53.630> with<00:05:53.840> primarily<00:05:54.670> matte<00:05:55.670> glazes<00:05:55.940> and

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
to work with primarily matte glazes and

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.710 
to work with primarily matte glazes and
I<00:05:57.020> do<00:05:57.080> a<00:05:57.170> combination<00:05:57.560> of<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.160> two<00:05:58.720> ranging

I do a combination of the two ranging

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.740 
I do a combination of the two ranging
from<00:05:59.990> very<00:06:00.560> matte<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:01.210> high-gloss<00:06:02.210> depending

from very matte to high-gloss depending

tile or big users of the technique

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.860 
tile or big users of the technique
basically<00:06:13.310> and<00:06:13.700> the<00:06:13.880> most<00:06:14.060> difficult<00:06:14.660> glaze

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
basically and the most difficult glaze

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
basically and the most difficult glaze
application<00:06:15.500> is<00:06:15.650> on<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:16.100> vertical<00:06:16.430> surface

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
application is on a vertical surface

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.680 
application is on a vertical surface
because<00:06:18.890> especially<00:06:19.790> in<00:06:20.090> high<00:06:20.240> fire<00:06:20.450> the

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
because especially in high fire the

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.690 
because especially in high fire the
glazes<00:06:21.080> tend<00:06:21.290> to<00:06:21.380> move<00:06:21.530> it's<00:06:22.250> all<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.490> question

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
glazes tend to move it's all a question

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.730 
glazes tend to move it's all a question
of<00:06:23.180> knowing<00:06:23.690> your<00:06:23.960> glazes<00:06:24.410> and<00:06:24.440> glaze

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
of knowing your glazes and glaze

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.480 
of knowing your glazes and glaze
application<00:06:25.720> I'm<00:06:26.720> a<00:06:26.780> very<00:06:27.170> meticulous<00:06:27.650> person

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
application I'm a very meticulous person

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.370 
application I'm a very meticulous person
and<00:06:29.050> very<00:06:30.050> careful<00:06:30.590> and<00:06:30.860> I<00:06:31.400> think<00:06:31.790> that<00:06:32.060> that

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
and very careful and I think that that

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.320 
and very careful and I think that that
helps<00:06:33.380> me<00:06:33.590> with<00:06:34.520> this<00:06:34.670> technique<00:06:35.060> a<00:06:35.210> lot

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
helps me with this technique a lot

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.890 
helps me with this technique a lot
because<00:06:35.660> it's<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:35.870> very<00:06:36.140> precise<00:06:37.900> technique

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
because it's a very precise technique

00:06:38.900 --> 00:07:02.750 
because it's a very precise technique
and<00:06:39.080> you<00:06:39.140> have<00:06:39.320> to<00:06:39.470> be<00:06:39.560> very<00:06:39.770> careful
