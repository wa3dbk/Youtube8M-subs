Bellmare and I think I might get some
hatred<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.570> feel<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.409> though

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
hatred for this one but I feel as though

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.749 
hatred for this one but I feel as though
Belle<00:01:59.579> mer<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.430> dumb

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
Belle mer was kind of dumb

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.789 
Belle mer was kind of dumb
she<00:02:03.119> obviously<00:02:03.270> sacrificed<00:02:04.140> herself<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.710> her

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
she obviously sacrificed herself for her

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
she obviously sacrificed herself for her
daughters<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.640> totally<00:02:06.240> unnecessary

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
daughters but it was totally unnecessary

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.990 
daughters but it was totally unnecessary
she's<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:07.890> focused<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.369> family<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.940> she

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
she's really focused on family so she

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.270 
she's really focused on family so she
decided<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
decided to

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.360 
decided to
who<00:02:10.750> died<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.470> place<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.920> her<00:02:13.040> daughter's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
who died in the place of her daughter's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.790 
who died in the place of her daughter's
obviously<00:02:14.120> by<00:02:14.390> paying<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.110> money<00:02:15.319> for<00:02:15.680> her

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
obviously by paying the money for her

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.590 
obviously by paying the money for her
daughter's<00:02:16.190> rather<00:02:16.640> than<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.030> her<00:02:17.180> even

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
daughter's rather than for her even

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.630 
daughter's rather than for her even
though<00:02:17.840> our<00:02:18.350> along<00:02:18.740> didn't<00:02:19.069> know<00:02:19.220> about<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
though our along didn't know about the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.820 
though our along didn't know about the
two<00:02:19.819> girls<00:02:20.140> Bellmare<00:02:21.140> placed<00:02:21.500> more

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
two girls Bellmare placed more

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.949 
two girls Bellmare placed more
importance<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.240> acknowledgement<00:02:23.870> of

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
importance on the acknowledgement of

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.050 
importance on the acknowledgement of
family<00:02:24.350> rather<00:02:24.590> than<00:02:24.770> her<00:02:25.310> actual<00:02:25.520> life

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
family rather than her actual life

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.410 
family rather than her actual life
wishes<00:02:26.600> initially<00:02:27.470> like<00:02:27.830> okay<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.940> cool<00:02:29.360> I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
wishes initially like okay that's cool I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.500 
wishes initially like okay that's cool I
guess<00:02:29.569> but<00:02:30.380> her<00:02:30.590> actions<00:02:30.860> left<00:02:31.640> two<00:02:32.090> young

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
guess but her actions left two young

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.050 
guess but her actions left two young
girls<00:02:32.840> without<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.800> mother<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.700> think<00:02:34.880> it's

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
girls without a mother I think it's

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.180 
girls without a mother I think it's
better<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.330> keep<00:02:35.660> them<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.989> secret<00:02:36.020> rather<00:02:36.770> than

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
better to keep them a secret rather than

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.850 
better to keep them a secret rather than
to<00:02:37.520> die<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.600> thought<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:38.959> an<00:02:39.050> unnecessary

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
to die I thought it was an unnecessary

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.280 
to die I thought it was an unnecessary
stand<00:02:40.520> for<00:02:40.940> her<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.180> take<00:02:41.360> against<00:02:41.840> our<00:02:42.080> long

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
stand for her to take against our long

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.320 
stand for her to take against our long
and<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.769> really<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:43.160> ended<00:02:43.430> up<00:02:43.519> scarring<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and it really just ended up scarring the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.270 
and it really just ended up scarring the
two<00:02:44.480> girls<00:02:44.720> because<00:02:45.140> they<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.860> only<00:02:46.070> lost

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
two girls because they not only lost

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.770 
two girls because they not only lost
their<00:02:46.519> mother<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:46.880> had<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.120> witness<00:02:47.420> her

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
their mother but had to witness her

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
dying in front of them all for really an

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.850 
dying in front of them all for really an
unnecessary<00:02:52.550> reason<00:02:53.000> number<00:02:53.480> five<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:54.230> Brooke

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
unnecessary reason number five is Brooke

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.330 
unnecessary reason number five is Brooke
and<00:02:55.100> his<00:02:55.280> mentor's<00:02:56.120> again<00:02:56.480> are<00:02:56.600> kind<00:02:56.810> of

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and his mentor's again are kind of

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.290 
and his mentor's again are kind of
unconventional<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.640> kind<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.150> went

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
unconventional and I kind of just went

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.780 
unconventional and I kind of just went
with<00:02:59.540> his<00:02:59.810> friends<00:03:00.500> from<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.830> past<00:03:01.069> Laboon

captain Yorkie and his crew they weren't

captain Yorkie and his crew they weren't
really<00:03:04.250> his<00:03:04.550> mentors<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.330> they<00:03:05.450> did<00:03:05.660> shape

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
really his mentors but they did shape

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.370 
really his mentors but they did shape
his<00:03:06.800> decisions<00:03:07.489> as<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.660> past<00:03:08.900> fifty<00:03:09.350> years

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
since he left them or they died and they

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.870 
since he left them or they died and they
were<00:03:12.319> obviously<00:03:12.500> really<00:03:12.980> cool<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.670> they<00:03:13.790> were

his friends and I I felt really sad when
they<00:03:17.060> died<00:03:17.360> even<00:03:18.200> though<00:03:18.410> Brooke<00:03:18.829> doesn't<00:03:19.100> try

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
not so much professor clover because I

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.430 
not so much professor clover because I

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
felt like he was kind of unnecessary

felt like he was kind of unnecessary
he<00:03:39.530> was<00:03:39.650> almost<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.489> know<00:03:40.609> not<00:03:40.850> even<00:03:41.120> really

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
he was almost you know not even really

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.740 
he was almost you know not even really
needed<00:03:41.959> he<00:03:42.109> was<00:03:42.230> nice<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.470> her<00:03:42.829> but<00:03:43.510> he<00:03:44.510> didn't

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
needed he was nice to her but he didn't
