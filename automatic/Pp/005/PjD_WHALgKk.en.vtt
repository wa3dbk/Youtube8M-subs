00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.469
 I know that people if this was enough 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.270
 video condition them how to duplicate 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.400
 bubbles in your playstation vita for 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.439
 this need to have an exploit with the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.540
 pcpe fighter that will be what they are 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.950
 watching the screen right now and good 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.750
 get a game that they can duplicate 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.309
 they can involve even the same exploit 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.230
 to be able to have several copies of it 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:33.050
 to be able to do this the only thing that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.210
 have to do is sell the pcpe filer 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.670
 and do the following that is the easiest 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.420
 of the world and well let's start and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.420
 they have to have their PC available with the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.340
 open is given to me and good with that of the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.579
 version of your console that we have in 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.860
 3.18 and we have the negative course we're going to 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.090
 go to there is no psp we go again 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.950
 from game this as the ppc but as 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.129
 we said this is going to be the game that we're going 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.659
 to duplicate that is the n pvh 1000 88 this 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.350
 base the game that we have duplicated then 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.990
 they have to do first 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.840
 is to put any one any 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.930
 modification to the name and for that they have 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.560
 that modify the game folder we are going to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560
 modify it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.330
 and we put any program name game 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.950
 x and after that we can modify 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.659
 everything inside this folder 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 now let's go to the folder that 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.189
 we want to duplicate for example this is going to 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.799
 be something like duplicate you select the 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.080
 game where the X lesis red in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.539
 name anything have a backup 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.270
 of this game on your number pc 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.070
 original that is the same as the second 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.890
 super copy before this and puts in 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.810
 any number or we can put by 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.810
 example we add a number 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.420
 or good or modify that you do not have to 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.310
 change the name I put 81 instead of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 88 now what they have to do is 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.640
 rename everything 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.929
 we can do this as many times as we want 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.480
 something they have to do is 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.930
 and be aware that from the steps 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.930
 etc 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.489
 after that you will have a game with 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.569
 a different code and that the one they're going to 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.370
 use 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.380
 there is the same but now let's go 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.960
 to the content manager 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.510
 and we are going to copy it again to the pc 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130
 and we will copy the game that we already have in 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
 the pc that is the backup that we said that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.140
 we had to have and you have it 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.480
 that we are going to connect here that 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.519
 I did not have it connected 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.030
 and let's move from the system precipitates to 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.739
 psp rubber pc and let's put the game 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.190
 that newly duplicated it will be this 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.440
 and we put it again on the pc and then 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.090
 when they have this, it happens to me only 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.220
 they have to do it again and it's going to have 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.290
 another bubble exactly like the other 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.730
 so you can do this how many 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.330
 Sometimes they just have to rename 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.250
 the folder several times and they may have 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.769
 as many backups have on the pc as 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.900
 want do not do an earthquake back ops and 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.610
 then they pass it again to the pc, avoid and 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.519
 they will have many bubbles with the same 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.079
 game and that's the basics we're going to stop 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.819
 that this fits to show you how many 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.910
 needles and I will spend several 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.680
 bubbles to see the difference 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.750
 good quantities against bubbles 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.930
 I have here I have four ready-made 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.000
 in the pc to try nothing else and here 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.310
 well you already spent the game go not going 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.290
 no error and then you have to do 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.160
 now it seems to give ps vita ie 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.420
 what's invested and they're going to copy the game with 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 also that they want here I have three 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.720
 game times 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.870
 let's pass it 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.490
 and wait until it's over we're going to 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.500
 wait and get it right as it is 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.460
 downloaded everything can disconnect from here 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.620
 you can close your whatever and go to 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.720
 see a lot of bubbles exactly 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.210
 equal to the one that you disputed that 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.620
 is the original and those who have the 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.270
 different name in the game have to 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.820
 do now is if they want to do more 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.260
 duplicates is to change the name again 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.540
 of any bubble that you have 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.570
 that they remain duplicate they change the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.060
 name and pass it to the pc with that name 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.040
 and then it will happen and they will have another 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.870
 folder with this one puts you the same game 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.000
 but with a name folder is 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.580
 different but with the same value 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.030
 for example here I have a duplicate going to 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.130
 turn around and see that he will accept and go to 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.720
 look to win no more but hey that's 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.360
 all for now many watch this video if 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.800
 you know like to thank you break follows 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.780
 Getting in is going to be tied up if they want 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.240
 some question or want to say something what 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.500
 that is because you want and good 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.070
 that's all and see you in the next 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.070
 and that's it
