get<00:03:58.310> them<00:03:58.519> right<00:03:59.319> the<00:04:00.319> problem<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.889> going<00:04:01.069> to

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
get them right the problem is going to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.920 
get them right the problem is going to
be<00:04:01.250> if<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:01.609> only<00:04:01.760> tried<00:04:02.030> once<00:04:02.329> a<00:04:02.480> week<00:04:02.690> and

might if you still don't have the

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.050 
might if you still don't have the
previous<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:09.650> down<00:04:09.920> then<00:04:10.639> you<00:04:10.730> might<00:04:10.880> get

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
previous one down then you might get

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.059 
previous one down then you might get
frustrated<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.959> might<00:04:12.109> feel<00:04:12.350> that<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:12.859> can't

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
frustrated you might feel that you can't

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.610 
frustrated you might feel that you can't
do<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.519> then<00:04:14.299> it's<00:04:14.870> not<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.319> fact<00:04:15.560> that

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
do it and then it's not the fact that

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.110 
do it and then it's not the fact that
you<00:04:15.769> can't<00:04:16.010> do<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.340> because<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.820> haven't<00:04:16.850> got

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
you can't do it because you haven't got

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.500 
you can't do it because you haven't got
the<00:04:17.150> talent<00:04:17.959> or<00:04:18.320> or<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.039> ability<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.639> play<00:04:19.850> the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the talent or or the ability to play the

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.600 
the talent or or the ability to play the
reason<00:04:20.930> for<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.139> would<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.620> be<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.039> you

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
reason for that would just be that you

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.520 
reason for that would just be that you
didn't<00:04:22.850> practice<00:04:23.180> enough<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:24.139> make<00:04:24.320> sure<00:04:24.350> that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
didn't practice enough so make sure that

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.800 
didn't practice enough so make sure that
doesn't<00:04:24.680> happen<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.400> you<00:04:25.550> find<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.450> time<00:04:26.660> of

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
doesn't happen to you find the time of

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.170 
doesn't happen to you find the time of
day<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:26.990> suits<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.650> really<00:04:28.010> well<00:04:28.220> practice

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
day that suits you really well practice

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.270 
day that suits you really well practice
every<00:04:29.750> single<00:04:30.020> day<00:04:30.289> I<00:04:30.470> would<00:04:30.889> really<00:04:31.130> suggest

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
every single day I would really suggest

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.030 
every single day I would really suggest
a<00:04:31.760> minimum<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.599> half<00:04:32.659> an<00:04:33.020> hour<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.260> day

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
a minimum of half an hour a day

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.570 
a minimum of half an hour a day
that<00:04:34.850> way<00:04:35.120> you'll<00:04:35.930> have<00:04:36.500> enough<00:04:36.890> time<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.190> work

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
that way you'll have enough time to work

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.190 
that way you'll have enough time to work
through<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.940> material<00:04:38.480> and<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.960> should
