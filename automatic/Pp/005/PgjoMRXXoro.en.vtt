00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.869 

when<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.319> say<00:02:18.620> how<00:02:19.040> come<00:02:19.400> this

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
when you see it you say how come this

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.869 
when you see it you say how come this
isn't<00:02:20.239> everywhere<00:02:20.629> how<00:02:21.290> come<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.920> not<00:02:22.010> it

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
isn't everywhere how come it's not it

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:34.119 
isn't everywhere how come it's not it
just<00:02:22.939> works<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:31.749> think<00:02:32.749> it's<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.019> great<00:02:33.049> idea<00:02:33.260> it

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
just works I think it's a great idea it

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.759 
just works I think it's a great idea it
should<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:35.209> done<00:02:35.450> at<00:02:35.780> all<00:02:35.930> schools<00:02:36.230> maybe

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
should be done at all schools maybe

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.190 
should be done at all schools maybe
it'll<00:02:37.010> take<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> year<00:02:37.400> maybe<00:02:38.329> it'll<00:02:38.540> take<00:02:38.750> 10

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
it'll take a year maybe it'll take 10

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.189 
it'll take a year maybe it'll take 10
minutes<00:02:39.469> but<00:02:39.799> it'll<00:02:39.950> happen
