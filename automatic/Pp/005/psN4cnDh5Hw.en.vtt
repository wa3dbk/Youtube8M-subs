the<00:00:00.359> last<00:00:00.599> thing<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:00.960> noticed<00:00:01.350> in<00:00:01.530> Washington

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
the last thing I noticed in Washington

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.579 
the last thing I noticed in Washington
DC<00:00:02.360> propelled<00:00:03.360> me<00:00:03.510> on<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> virtual<00:00:04.020> journey

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
DC propelled me on a virtual journey

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.610 
DC propelled me on a virtual journey
around<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.130> world<00:00:06.140> remember<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> pair<00:00:07.500> of

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
around the world remember the pair of

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.650 
around the world remember the pair of
interlocking<00:00:08.370> triangles<00:00:08.670> surrounding<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

White<00:00:09.840> House<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.740> struck<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
White House it struck me that the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.789 
White House it struck me that the
horseshoe-shaped<00:00:12.420> lawn<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.320> White<00:00:13.590> House

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.129 
horseshoe-shaped lawn in the White House
backyard<00:00:14.549> looked<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.269> lot<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.960> blue

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
backyard looked a lot like the blue

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.980 
backyard looked a lot like the blue
stone<00:00:16.470> ring<00:00:16.740> at<00:00:16.920> Stonehenge<00:00:17.600> that<00:00:18.600> got<00:00:18.840> me

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
stone ring at Stonehenge that got me

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.570 
stone ring at Stonehenge that got me
thinking<00:00:19.170> how<00:00:19.529> these<00:00:19.710> two<00:00:19.949> triangles

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
thinking how these two triangles

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.200 
thinking how these two triangles
together<00:00:21.029> form<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.840> 5<00:00:22.140> x<00:00:22.470> 12<00:00:22.800> rectangle<00:00:23.519> that

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
together form of 5 x 12 rectangle that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.420 
together form of 5 x 12 rectangle that
has<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.630> same<00:00:24.840> proportions<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.949> station

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
has the same proportions as the station

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.470 
has the same proportions as the station

following<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.630> hunch<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.230> drew<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> line<00:00:31.980> from

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
following this hunch I drew a line from

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
following this hunch I drew a line from
the<00:00:32.430> tip<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> federal<00:00:33.329> triangle<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.200> the

to<00:00:37.320> zoom<00:00:37.590> into<00:00:37.770> New<00:00:38.010> York<00:00:38.220> City<00:00:38.430> when<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to zoom into New York City when this

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
to zoom into New York City when this
layer<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.809> saw<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.890> alignment

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
