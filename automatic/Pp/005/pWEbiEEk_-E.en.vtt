00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.950 

I<00:00:07.550> had<00:00:08.550> decided<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.150> would<00:00:09.300> be<00:00:09.420> an<00:00:09.510> artist<00:00:09.780> in

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
I had decided I would be an artist in

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.810 
I had decided I would be an artist in
fifth<00:00:10.200> grade<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.710> guess<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.519> felt<00:00:11.670> really

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
fifth grade I guess I just felt really

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.390 
fifth grade I guess I just felt really
good<00:00:12.000> about<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.469> had<00:00:14.009> kind<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.340> made

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
good about and and I had kind of made

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
good about and and I had kind of made
the<00:00:14.670> decision<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.120> then<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.350> was

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the decision that then that that was

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.170 
the decision that then that that was
what<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.710> wanted<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> didn't<00:00:17.880> really<00:00:18.060> know

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
what I wanted to do I didn't really know

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.410 
what I wanted to do I didn't really know
much<00:00:18.210> about<00:00:18.390> actually<00:00:19.350> doing<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
much about actually doing that but that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.529 
much about actually doing that but that
was<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> wanted<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:23.390> work<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.510> lot

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
was what I wanted to do I work a lot

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.929 
was what I wanted to do I work a lot
from<00:00:25.230> nature<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.359> very<00:00:27.359> very<00:00:27.900> interested<00:00:28.439> in

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
from nature and very very interested in

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
from nature and very very interested in
cycles<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.210> nature<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.710> changes<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
cycles in nature and the changes and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.630 
cycles in nature and the changes and
things<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.390> continuous<00:00:34.100> that<00:00:35.100> involved

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
things that are continuous that involved

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
things that are continuous that involved
that<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.660> cycle<00:00:37.110> back<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.320> begin<00:00:37.770> again<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that that cycle back and begin again and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.590 
that that cycle back and begin again and
I<00:00:39.710> spend<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.420> looking<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
I spend a lot of time looking and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.410 
I spend a lot of time looking and
collecting<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.649> photographing<00:00:44.460> things<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
collecting and photographing things that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.990 
collecting and photographing things that
fit<00:00:46.410> into<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.070> me

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.400 

this<00:00:50.540> group<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.960> work<00:00:51.970> is<00:00:52.970> very<00:00:53.240> related<00:00:53.810> to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
this group of work is very related to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.620 
this group of work is very related to
the<00:00:54.530> river<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:55.910> lot<00:00:56.060> of<00:00:56.090> work<00:00:56.450> I've<00:00:56.600> done

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
the river and a lot of work I've done

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.400 
the river and a lot of work I've done
has<00:00:56.989> been<00:00:57.280> because<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.460> river<00:00:58.670> seems<00:00:59.030> to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
has been because the river seems to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.110 
has been because the river seems to
contain<00:01:00.410> all<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:01.130> that<00:01:01.280> information<00:01:01.550> is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
contain all of that information is

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.910 
contain all of that information is
changing<00:01:02.680> flowing<00:01:03.680> cycle<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.640> nature<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.920> it

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
changing flowing cycle of nature and it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.430 
changing flowing cycle of nature and it
seems<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.280> stand<00:01:07.580> for<00:01:07.880> everything<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:09.170> life

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
seems to stand for everything in life

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.440 
seems to stand for everything in life
and<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.780> use<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.080> as<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.820> basis<00:01:14.240> I

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
and and so I use that as the basis I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.770 
and and so I use that as the basis I
think<00:01:14.690> for<00:01:14.930> what<00:01:15.080> I'm<00:01:15.200> working<00:01:15.860> with<00:01:16.780> this

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
think for what I'm working with this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.460 
think for what I'm working with this
whole<00:01:17.990> body<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.410> work<00:01:18.670> all<00:01:19.670> pent<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:20.330> which<00:01:21.290> is

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
whole body of work all pent is which is

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.380 
whole body of work all pent is which is
called<00:01:21.770> flows<00:01:22.100> forward<00:01:22.460> all<00:01:22.910> tends<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
called flows forward all tends to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.359 
called flows forward all tends to
actually<00:01:23.660> flow<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.590> direction<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
actually flow in that direction of the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.310 
actually flow in that direction of the
river<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:25.790> they<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.720> look<00:01:26.899> at<00:01:27.020> every

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
river and they if you look at every

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.730 
river and they if you look at every
piece<00:01:27.560> they<00:01:27.830> all<00:01:28.009> move<00:01:28.580> in<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.390> direction

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
piece they all move in that direction

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.050 
piece they all move in that direction
that<00:01:30.740> itself<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.790> part<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.180> idea

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
that itself is part of that idea

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
that itself is part of that idea
bro

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.510 

and<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.340> think<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.420> tend<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.260> divide<00:01:41.830> faces

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and I think that I tend to divide faces

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.350 
and I think that I tend to divide faces
up<00:01:42.960> doing<00:01:43.960> different<00:01:44.290> detectives

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.550 

I<00:01:48.420> don't<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.320> work

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
I don't really think that my work

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.450 
I don't really think that my work
actually<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:51.080> images<00:01:52.080> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.459 

kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> discoveries<00:01:57.240> about

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
kind of discoveries about

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.319 
kind of discoveries about
the<00:01:59.770> work<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.189> progressing<00:02:00.429> in<00:02:00.939> these<00:02:01.090> 1

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
the work is progressing in these 1

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.899 
the work is progressing in these 1
minutes<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:02.770> moving<00:02:03.069> forward<00:02:03.490> it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
minutes so it's moving forward it's

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.730 
minutes so it's moving forward it's
doing<00:02:04.210> what<00:02:04.359> my<00:02:04.479> paintings<00:02:04.869> are<00:02:04.990> about<00:02:05.079> now

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
doing what my paintings are about now

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.270 
doing what my paintings are about now
it's<00:02:05.920> cycling<00:02:06.520> changing
