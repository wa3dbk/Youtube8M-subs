00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.130
 back to my channel and welcome from 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.910
 new to Friday with seeing how good it is 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.429
 habit 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.160
 a few weeks ago I'm already going up 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 on Saturday since good they for the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.549
 radial difference I already told you in the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 previous video that good they what 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.400
 they publish here in Spain at night and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.470
 well I have to force myself to upload it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.350
 Saturday and record it on Saturday as 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.269
 that it's too late for me to record it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 on Friday since they publish it very 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.420
 late then good I hope what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.489
 you understand and well this in this week in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 this video we are going to be talking about 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 good the blackout and the party the group and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 the guild is not something that interests me 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 since good when I leave the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 game I have thought for all those 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.610
 do not know because many times I 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.440
 you ask in the videos that both 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.949
 they like it when it's now I see you now 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.109
 it's a guild plan and yeah yeah guys I'll go 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.380
 to do do not worry and well then 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.110
 basically on this Friday they show us 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.380
 It's a little bit , they put three pictures of what 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.480
 that would be the guild and the party of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.060
 group for what we will do to do 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.870
 quest punti vitali then life the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 experience and others 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.610
 Well you will be as always watching 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.770
 the background images and well then 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.890
 basically the first image we see what 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.750
 which would be the characteristics of the clan 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.970
 Well, the usual thing is not the members 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.800
 that there are the levels that each one has and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 in the area where they are currently 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 When I see this I get a lot of emotion 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.080
 the truth because I have so many 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.690
 memories of this game that I do not know is 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.280
 like it seems impossible to come back 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 but every time I see this, it's like, 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.070
 I do not know it's strange because I kind of like 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.890
 returns the hopes not but good in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 Then we are taught the two 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.789
 following images 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 for the theme of the party group 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.219
 basically since you are already seeing you are 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.570
 seeing in the images already what 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.490
 what is there and the options that there are in party 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.220
 etcetera and good the truth that I do not have 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.599
 no idea where this figure is in the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.049
 What are these statues sounds like to me? 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.360
 a lot and I do not know what then 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.299
 I always tell you can you comment I complained 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.819
 where are they since good ye 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.950
 I'm sure you know and well 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.620
 basically what they have put us in 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.750
 this week in the post says well says what 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.829
 Come on guys, let's show something 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.760
 what we have is good what we have 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.890
 been working that the guild and in 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.480
 the party the group there is not much to say 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 but if you have questions then 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.620
 ask us basically is to say already 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.090
 you know how I always say go to the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.400
 damn web of 'dragon ball' online 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.580
 rebuke you have it in the description and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.880
 ask what you want 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.400
 you will always see everything before there finally 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.890
 I know it's unthinkable but always 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.910
 I say it because many do not know or do not know 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.080
 you ask me and there you can see it 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.030
 keep saying we did not do any 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.130
 video about this since it will last shortly 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.540
 and it's going to last five seconds obviously and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.430
 it will last a little bit because good 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.360

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.830
 said in all the videos that well 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.990
 I'm waiting for something else 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.120
 because I think that already good I do not know what 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.830
 episode is this the truth of Friday 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 with duty I think it's the number 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.500
 or 20 I think 20 weeks are already 20 weeks 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.350
 are 20 weeks are many weeks 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.200
 I know the truth that good as always 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.960
 I tell you we can never take anything 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.990

 present standing waiting but good in 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.710
 end the truth that I want to be 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.990

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.670
 I encourage you to do a live show or 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.210
 I do not know what problem they do in 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.370
 direct what the initials are doing 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.769
 of a character from what I know which one 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.780
 character who is doing does not matter 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.580
 the missions after initials and 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.260
 entering a bit on the game 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.270
 and freeing up a little since 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.640
 is a direct one of a couple of hours a 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.150
 hour and a half then teaching how it would be 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.920
 everything as it goes etcetera etcetera but 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.860
 well anyway is that is what I would do 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.240
 so good I in my opinion and good 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.380
 Well, what they do is obviously 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.660
 totally respectable 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.630
 I respect them obviously so nothing 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.760
 this family is going to be this Friday with 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.140
 worse I feel that it was so short 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.180
 but well you know that I can only 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.440

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.850
