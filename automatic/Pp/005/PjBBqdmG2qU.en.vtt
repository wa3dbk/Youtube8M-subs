00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
even if it's thursday i'm going to be

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.649 
even if it's thursday i'm going to be
come<00:03:23.109> on<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.590> for<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.769> matching<00:03:24.099> stream

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
come on just for the matching stream

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.759 
come on just for the matching stream
it's<00:03:25.659> gonna<00:03:25.780> be<00:03:25.900> harder<00:03:26.139> for<00:03:26.169> you<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.349> catch<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
it's gonna be harder for you to catch it

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.589 
it's gonna be harder for you to catch it
i<00:03:26.919> guess<00:03:27.159> but<00:03:27.579> it's<00:03:27.760> okay<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:28.329> a<00:03:28.419> good

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
i guess but it's okay it's a good

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.530 
i guess but it's okay it's a good
compromise<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.889> i<00:03:29.919> might<00:03:30.129> be<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.540> to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
compromise so i might be with it to

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.689 
compromise so i might be with it to
guess
