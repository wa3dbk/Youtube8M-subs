asking about lately and really hoping

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.400

that<00:00:11.849> Kali<00:00:12.120> would<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.750> they<00:00:12.840> finally<00:00:13.110> have

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that Kali would do and they finally have

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.440 
that Kali would do and they finally have
what<00:00:14.309> does<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.549> mean<00:00:14.790> though<00:00:15.030> if<00:00:15.089> every<00:00:15.210> one

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
what does this mean though if every one

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.660 
what does this mean though if every one
priority<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.220> those<00:00:17.340> things<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
priority was one of those things that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
priority was one of those things that
like<00:00:17.970> I'll<00:00:18.600> give<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:18.840> example<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.289> explain<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
like I'll give an example to explain it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.370 
like I'll give an example to explain it
better<00:00:20.390> rescue<00:00:21.390> rabbit<00:00:21.539> would<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.020> her<00:00:22.199> tea

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
better rescue rabbit would have her tea

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
better rescue rabbit would have her tea
when<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.650> summoned<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> couldn't

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
when it's summoned so that you couldn't

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150 
when it's summoned so that you couldn't
get<00:00:24.779> its<00:00:24.900> effect<00:00:25.230> unless<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.800> use<00:00:25.890> something

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
get its effect unless you use something

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.560 
get its effect unless you use something
like<00:00:26.310> Soul<00:00:26.580> morning<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.180> why<00:00:27.300> sell

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
like Soul morning this is why sell

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
like Soul morning this is why sell
morning<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.140> widely<00:00:28.320> used<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> lie<00:00:29.010> upon

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
morning was so widely used a lie upon

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.859 
morning was so widely used a lie upon
used<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.000> that's<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> reason

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
used it you know you that's the reason

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.240 
used it you know you that's the reason
why<00:00:30.990> people<00:00:31.230> wouldn't<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.619> bottomless<00:00:32.070> trap

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
why people wouldn't use bottomless trap

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.560 
why people wouldn't use bottomless trap
hole<00:00:32.279> instead<00:00:32.640> because<00:00:33.030> bottomless<00:00:33.390> trap

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
hole instead because bottomless trap

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
hole instead because bottomless trap
hole<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.020> negate<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> effect<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
hole would not negate the effect of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.830 
hole would not negate the effect of
rescue<00:00:35.430> rabbit<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.820> soul<00:00:36.000> morning<00:00:36.329> negates

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
rescue rabbit but soul morning negates

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.380 
rescue rabbit but soul morning negates
the<00:00:37.079> summon<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.649> affect<00:00:37.920> everything<00:00:38.390> well

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the summon they affect everything well

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.500 
the summon they affect everything well
anyway<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.290> priority<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.860> gone<00:00:41.510> anything

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
anyway with priority now gone anything

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
anyway with priority now gone anything
can<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.649> negate<00:00:44.190> those<00:00:44.399> kinds<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
can just about negate those kinds of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240 
can just about negate those kinds of
effects<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:45.899> basically<00:00:46.440> bottomless

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
effects now so now basically bottomless

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
effects now so now basically bottomless
trap<00:00:47.460> hole<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.210> better<00:00:48.570> than<00:00:48.930> soul

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
trap hole is in a way better than soul

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
trap hole is in a way better than soul
morning<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.890> basically<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.910> because

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
morning in basically you know because

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.920 
morning in basically you know because
you<00:00:51.210> don't<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> give<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.719> life

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you don't have to give up your life

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.240 
you don't have to give up your life
points<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> gets<00:00:52.710> remove<00:00:52.920> from<00:00:53.039> play<00:00:53.190> so

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
points and it gets remove from play so

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
points and it gets remove from play so
now<00:00:53.520> bottle<00:00:54.420> strap<00:00:54.570> hole<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.020> considered<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
now bottle strap hole is considered to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
now bottle strap hole is considered to
be<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.039> same<00:00:56.280> speed<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.879> saw<00:00:57.210> morning<00:00:57.480> if

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
be the same speed as saw morning if

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450 
be the same speed as saw morning if
that's<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> best<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> explain<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that's the best way I know to explain it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
that's the best way I know to explain it
but<00:00:59.820> yeah<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.270> should<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> game<00:01:00.960> much

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but yeah this should make the game much

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
but yeah this should make the game much
easier<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.039> understand<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.910> less

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
easier to understand a little less

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.390 
easier to understand a little less
confusing<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.229> hopefully<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.339> help

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
confusing and hopefully this will help

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130 
confusing and hopefully this will help
out<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.939> mean<00:01:06.090> no<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
out a lot I mean no I really like that a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.480 
out a lot I mean no I really like that a
bottomless<00:01:07.439> trap<00:01:07.650> hole<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.369> useful

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
bottomless trap hole will be more useful

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
bottomless trap hole will be more useful
there's<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> course<00:01:09.090> tons<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.720> other<00:01:09.840> cards

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
there's a course tons of other cards

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
there's a course tons of other cards
that<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:11.460> usable<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that are going to be more usable like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
that are going to be more usable like
changes<00:01:12.270> appearance<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> mean<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.409> go

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
changes appearance I mean I can just go

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.899 
changes appearance I mean I can just go
through<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> list<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.369> especially<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
through the list on and on especially a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
through the list on and on especially a
cards<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> strong

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
cards that are going to be a strong

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.080 
cards that are going to be a strong
anymore<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.400> means<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> wrist<00:01:17.939> grab

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
anymore so now that means a wrist grab

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.880 
anymore so now that means a wrist grab
it's<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.810> nearly<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.530> deadly<00:01:19.860> as

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it's not going to be nearly as deadly as

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
it's not going to be nearly as deadly as
it<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.270> yeah<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> can't<00:01:21.659> wait<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:21.960> what
