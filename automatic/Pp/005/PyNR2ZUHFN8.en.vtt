because not a lot of salons have a big

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.330 
because not a lot of salons have a big
budget<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.970> chairs<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.680> happened<00:01:11.159> if

you don't spend the money to buy the
quality<00:01:13.140> chair<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.520> chairs<00:01:14.790> end<00:01:14.970> up

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
long time so that's that's really our
goal<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.659> love<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> base<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> chair

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
goal there I love the base of this chair

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.120 
goal there I love the base of this chair
the<00:01:41.700> base<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:43.229> flat<00:01:43.530> stainless

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the base is a really flat stainless

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
the base is a really flat stainless
steel<00:01:44.280> base<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.720> really

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
steel base as you can see it's really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.920 
steel base as you can see it's really
heavy<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.520> guests<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.000> tip<00:01:48.210> over<00:01:48.360> which

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
heavy so the guests don't tip over which

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
heavy so the guests don't tip over which
is<00:01:49.079> nice<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> first<00:01:50.399> chair<00:01:50.640> I've

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
is nice it's the first chair I've

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.340 
is nice it's the first chair I've
actually<00:01:51.090> owned<00:01:51.299> where<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> guests<00:01:52.200> aren't

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
actually owned where the guests aren't

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
actually owned where the guests aren't
falling<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> guys<00:01:54.299> have

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
falling out of it so if you guys have

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.450 
falling out of it so if you guys have
had<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.840> challenge<00:01:55.110> before<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:56.219> really

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
had that challenge before that's really

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.850 
had that challenge before that's really
why<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.450> got<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> good<00:01:57.750> balance<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
why so it's got a good balance to it the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
why so it's got a good balance to it the
hydraulic<00:01:59.340> pump<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.759> great<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.899> guests

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
hydraulic pump is great you have guests

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
hydraulic pump is great you have guests
that<00:02:01.409> are<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:01.829> heavier<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.369> lot<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that are a little bit heavier a lot of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
that are a little bit heavier a lot of
times<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.750> would<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.899> trouble<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.950> cheaper

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
times I would have trouble with cheaper

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.889 
times I would have trouble with cheaper
hydraulics<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.479> wouldn't<00:02:06.659> pump

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
hydraulics because they wouldn't pump

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
hydraulics because they wouldn't pump
the<00:02:07.020> guest<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.469> enough<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.310> easy<00:02:08.729> enough<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the guest up enough or easy enough so

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.300 
the guest up enough or easy enough so
this<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.020> has<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> great<00:02:10.440> hydraulic<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
this one has a great hydraulic on it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.710 
this one has a great hydraulic on it
it's<00:02:12.209> comfortable<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.379> me

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it's comfortable it's me

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.410 
it's comfortable it's me
of<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.900> vinyl<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.650> works<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.100> well<00:02:15.220> my<00:02:16.000> big

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
of a vinyl that works really well my big

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.150 
of a vinyl that works really well my big
recommendation<00:02:16.720> would<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.260> if<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.860> pick<00:02:18.040> up

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
recommendation would be if you pick up

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.010 
recommendation would be if you pick up
this<00:02:18.310> chair<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:18.970> plastic<00:02:19.510> back

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
this chair to get this plastic back

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.170 
this chair to get this plastic back
which<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.980> thought<00:02:21.310> wouldn't<00:02:21.640> look<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.850> good

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
which I thought wouldn't look that good

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.380 
which I thought wouldn't look that good
but<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> slips<00:02:22.780> right<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.050> here

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
