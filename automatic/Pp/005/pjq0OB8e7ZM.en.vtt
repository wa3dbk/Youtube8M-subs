 of correct information about the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 metabolism and health without water there's 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.919
 metabolism without metabolism there is no life 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.630
 of if fran suÃ¡rez specialist in 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.519
 metabolism obesity good the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 metabolism tv we have more and more 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.300
 followers more people who are watching 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.780
 episodes of metabolism tv through 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.010
 of the whole planet in Spain ' in 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.190

 Caribbean in the US among Latinos are 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.500
 watching metabolism tv 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.060
 and more than 50,000 people see it 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.860
 weekly so we are 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.660
 We keep ourselves very active 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.310
 answering your questions 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.100
 doing research to answer you 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.809
 in an appropriate and educational way the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.790
 issues that you are concerned about 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.010
 you want to know about metabolism 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.690
 know that puntocom dvd metabolism 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.640
 you can write us can 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.800
 write to the bottom is a blog 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.210
 blocks and that you can write is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.340
 like a newspaper that is on the internet 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.290
 metabolism that you can write and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.790
 we are always going to answer can 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.710
 that we try a little in answering 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.360
 because we are full but never 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.590
 we forget to answer him so this 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 dependent that we are going to answer 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.310
 so 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.079
 Today 's theme is the theme of water and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.579
 metabolism you have seen the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.039
 tb metabolism there are several episodes 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.210
 very popular as episode number 7 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.490
 and others that speaks of the water of the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.679
 importance of water it is true that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 can regain metabolism is true 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.490
 that you can not lose weight is true that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 you can not count diabetes and you do not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 Take enough water is impossible but 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.810
 today I want to teach them because that is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.579
 well and I want to tell you what happens 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.130
 inside the cells of your body 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.899
 when you drink water we go for the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.119
 blackboard to then put a little bit 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.619
 of science to this she may not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.599
 are seeing some people that are 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.819
 students of chemistry and they will understand 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.039
 of this but you do not need to understand 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.140
 of chemistry to understand that by taking 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.299
 water is the only way you can 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.700
 recover metabolism here goes so 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.080
 think look here on the blackboard I already have 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.440
 put here 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.030
 a formula if you do not know chemistry nor 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.710
 worry do not worry about 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.960
 understand it I 'm going to give you one more or 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 less than what is this formula that is 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.100
 here 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.300
 have to see this that says ms atp 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.690
 this is here m that is an atp 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.700
 means in English adenosine 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.500
 triphosphate is adenosine triphosphate 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.080
 one cell one cell 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.210
 has its nucleus we have 30 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.890
 trillions of cells a frac as you want 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.380
 see are many 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 every cell produces energy and you are 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.260
 So alive and with so much energy and with so much 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.420
 metabolism as the sum of all the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.600
 energy that produces in your cells a 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.940
 healthy well energetic cell goes 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.630
 to produce a lot 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.630
 atp 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.840
 is the chemical energy of the body as if 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.090
 outside the gasoline that produces in the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.150
 cells inside chemical energy well 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.220
 that when this form of atp is a 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.200
 form that contains magnesium 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.709
 magnesium 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.590
 a magnesium form of atp the atp but 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.129
 mixed with the mineral magnesium this is the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.250
 main form of energy they produce 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.709
 the cells when you have taken water 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.140
 enough this diet making your diet 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.000
 correct has balanced the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.209
 candidates because I do not like excess the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.310
 proteins and has balanced the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.349
 carbohydrates that you are going to eat and the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.660
 fats you have a balance and have a 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.150
 internal balance within the cell of 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.670
 the cell is producing a lot of atp that 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.250
 chemical energy in a healthy way that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.200
 happens the most powerful atp that exists is 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.030
 the magnesium in equipment 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.060
 that atp magnesium has been discovered 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.720
 which has a unit value of 600 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.459
 units 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.010
 but that produces the cells and 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.820
 magnesium to make it produces its 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.400
 magnesium atp 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.110
 has a value of energy units of 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.660
 energy to move case to movement 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.550
 to maintain the metabolism of 600 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.680
 units look at what was discovered when 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.330
 you take the magnesium in atp and what 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.330
 mix with this that is here that makes 2 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.610
 what is h 2 is water 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.560
 now you take the atp magnesium that 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
 produces your cell are you taking the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.240
 glasses of water having reached the water 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.389
 mixed he sees that he has the other sign is 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.280
 mixed the water with magnesium atp and 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.539
 now all this reaction happens here and not 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.099
 It is important that you know what 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.229
 what is important is happening here 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.770
 that you know that now you combine 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:03.060
 water with the mag nation atp that produces 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.430
 your cell now these 600 multiply 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.599
 by more than 10 times and 6 thousand are produced 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.599
 435 units of energy 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.160
 but I'm putting so not very technical to 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.259
 those who know about this these are kilos and 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.410
 all that thing but the issue is that when 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.330
 you drink water and drink enough water 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.060
 the magnesium an atp that produces its 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.849
 cells multiplies in power from 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.280
 energy by 10 because because the water is 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.130
 hydrolyzes and releases hydrogen and 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.550
 hydrogen by joining the atp creates a 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.340
 energy of 6,435 where there was only 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.639
 600 so how slimming thins 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.470
 drinking water if you take your weight if 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.229
 you measure kilograms and divide it 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.270
 for 7 let's say it weighs 70 kilograms what 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.160
 divides by the way but also step if 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.680
 you take your weight and divide it the book 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.840
 you say that he sealed 160 pounds of weight 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.199
 divide it by the number 16 and it will give 10 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.729
 step take your weight 100 kilograms what 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.409
 divide by 7 and know how many glasses of 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.870
 water they touch the day does not serve the 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.280
 diet soda is pure water h2o what 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.430
 what is needed is going to produce this 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.409
 energy if you take it if measured in 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.759
 pounds as we measure here in states 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.340
 united puerto rico divides it says 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.080
 that does not matter to him so to drink water 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.270
 and have energy 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.370
 have health and these are the ones I share 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.370
 Because the truth always triumphs
