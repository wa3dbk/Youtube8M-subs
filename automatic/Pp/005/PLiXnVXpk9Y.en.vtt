00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.870
 origin the word allows 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.530
 come 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.240
 some permanent culture 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.309
 to say we do not love each other we do not work 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.059
 the soil we water the obviously for 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.059
 to arrive in desert does not want 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.670
 we have mangos and who wears the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.420
 second year of currants the year 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.280
 next 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.040
 but otherwise it's three four 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.280
 minimum in ten years we will really have 60 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.920
 70% of yields on average 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.960
 vegetable balester and vegetable fruits 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.950
 good root vegetables this is in the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 six months into the night 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.070
 you have to know that for 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.720
 500 sqm so that's the ratio we have at 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.190
 saint gall so we can feed it on 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.200
 can be in complete autonomy in 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.930
 fresh products with cereals by 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.340
 legumes necessarily but all that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.180
 is fresh vegetables fruits 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.180
 it's enough 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.970
 there is a complete chaining 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.730
 gardens associations July the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.530
 common gardens composting and 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.170
 probably even the couple's wood 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.610
 farmer who is a wood that groups together 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.680
 will be able to read an arboretum since it is 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 and brings together very beautiful trees 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.920
 very good 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.720
 in theory yes 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.460
 first of all for the neighbors it is 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.240
 not at all done for people who 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.660
 want the other side of the city from 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.330
 strasbourg 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.260
 but we have no reason not to 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.540
 accept the people who come 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.560
 anyway 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.740
 the question is simply 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.690
 that people are going to tell people very 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.670
 engaged informed was faster than 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.820
 the local residents who put a 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.840
 despite three four meetings they put 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.640
 a crazy time to decide 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.560
 conclusion there is a very strong minority 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.439
 but from the beginning we have 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.930
 said at the beginning we were five 5 of the neighborhood 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.189
 station we will read and everything else was 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.420
 available we did three four 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.770
 prevailing during which one really 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.090
 chanted it looks like this project made for 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.200
 the local residents it will only work if 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.330
 residents in significant numbers 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.640
 well by dint of waiting to wait 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.930
 wait there is only 5.6 a small 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.310
 dozens of residents in I think 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.180
 that he will have internal to the futures greens this 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.519
 would be especially the local residents who 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.290
 will come because it works well when 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.290
 it is fueled by proximity
