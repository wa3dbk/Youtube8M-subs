 the light guides of the world in the whole we 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.850
 particular new hobby 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.640
 exotic burqa yards and homemade 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.160
 window sills grow weeds yes no 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.470
 simple and tropical flowering 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.960
 Bromeliad family grow 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.540
 which are mainly in tropical and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.430
 subtropical areas of america from 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.900
 florida cottages or some other 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 ten to fifteen years ago in 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.290
 domestic popular reference books on 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.870
 indoor floriculture 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.970
 there was very little information about 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.400
 this family or that at all 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.690
 absent 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.030
 popular science publications could 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.140
 gather valuable information only about 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.360
 pineapple culture 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.739
 like the most famous and tasty 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.409
 family members 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.500
 Now times have changed in many 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.330
 countries of the world created a society of lovers 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.070
 bromeliads that periodically publish 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.760
 various reference books and 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.010
 magazines 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.770
 they not only carry out a wide exchange 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.520
 seeds and planting materials we 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.530
 Expeditions South America 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.900
 promote armor culture 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.040
 you actively contribute to their popularization 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.320
 and this is what we have in revit but the families are all 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.390
 also you ppm and now they are very 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.000
 as if they are very common 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.479
 they buy for a gift firstly 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.690
 for their originality will hear shine 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.490
 Now this is considered a flower but they 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.649
 will go down again not even with 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.399
 every sinus in type come out 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:56.110
 small bows multicolored ubeat 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.090
 start white to purple and blue 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.570
 On care she as though you were able not at all 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 very difficult main transplant correctly 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 replant their very fragile roots 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.640
 if the possibility is very often not 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.380
 re- transplant as needed 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.840
 produced in early spring 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.730
 root system of most bromeliads 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.680
 poorly developed even though 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.180
 impressive size of the laser part 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.280
 plants therefore 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.739
 tree for transplant should not be very 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.860
 big u like beavers meriva i'm not an altar 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.250
 over pussy 1 1 as it is considered at all 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.590
 project plant parasites they grow on 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.870
 trees from yes there in america near the village with 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.480
 these countries well, and we like even 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.310
 You can make them out of here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.530
 such as the opportunity we give 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.510
 jelly type of wood i'm straight to him 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.510
 trees, ear can be planted 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.430
 very little land they need for growth but in 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.739
 unlike other plants, they don’t 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.769
 demanding simliche zimin what was 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.950
 constantly transplanting a lot of rich land 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.489
 they are a little bit lacking at all 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.489
 get hold of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.440
 Well, yes, many now we once again desert 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.870
 but like a grandson in these big gardens 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.240
 winter do bromeliad trees namely 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.550
 Well, like a tree, and this pee romp her 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 in the world 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.170
 measured bromeliads 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.540
 beautiful ornamental plant them 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.000
 interesting foliage and above all bright 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.540
 sometimes even flashy coloring of flowers and 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.210
 leaves 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.880
 makes them extremely attractive 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.340
 for lovers of decorative floriculture 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.920
 besides, these plants are not demanding 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.680
 to care should only follow the rules 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.720
 watering flowers must be in the funnel 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.510
 pouring water on them is a must and 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.350
 content as board watering is done 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.660
 through a funnel into the main well, just yet 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.400
 you can feed but the fit is better 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.420
 produce by leaves and method 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.850
 spray well by temperature 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.670
 they are not as picky as you can 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.900
 what will happen but at warm temperatures not 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.270
 necessarily low and minutes well of course from 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.580
 dryness of humidity as always we have everything 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:16.080
 Flowers suffers need to spray us 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:20.739
 often at least 2 to 3–4 times a day 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:24.190
 three or four days but so help today 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.290
 penumbra can grow not necessarily 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.960
 scattering their light for and what now how 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.600
 many people buy an apartment with a new one 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.610
 there would be little light and that they would not 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.950
 requires bright lighting 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.440
 if you decide to donate bloom in a riza 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.370
 can be calm in a couple of days 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.199
 will not fade 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.169
 but will delight his florist 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.290
 the beauty of a few months they bloom from 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.870
 6 months or more depending on too 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.660
 but by type and variety 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.760
 About but after flowering when flower nose 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.610
 he immediately begins to lose color 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.490
 pales thus even here and here these three 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.040
 blades yes and then he dries himself by 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.130
 Statement flower when the flower from the beginning 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.449
 were already closer to the institution yes he 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.340
 kids start to form here 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.210
 still 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.139
 twigs right here 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.900
 at the side 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.340
 these babies are formed are deposited in no 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.710
 In no case, as long as I myself 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.479
 achieved approximately the growth of this maternal 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.970
 that's it that's all risk mean yes 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.130
 then you can otsazhu better not to do 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.889
 Well, if you drop out of the maternal 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.600
 buds can be wrong yes that bloom 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.669
 you can never wait for better 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.240
 wait for each when maternal kidney 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:46.870
 herself stay this color dry well and 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.180
 after feeding as if before flowering 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.270
 before the arrow appears if 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.800
 it appears that everything is better already not 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.169
 feed like so well 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.340
 the duration of flowering is already from 6 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.010
 months or more 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.780
 our country, all indoor plants or 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.520
 grown in local flower 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.190
 greenhouses either start up 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.750
 usually from countries specializing 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.479
 on the flower trade 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.570
 for example Holland both in the first and in 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.230
 the second case has its pros and cons 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.420
 plus imported plants 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.850
 that they are bigger and more beautiful than 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.640
 local and considered more resilient 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.080
 because they are specially prepared 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.990
 transportation from one country to another 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.540
 minus such transportation is a lot of stress for 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.670
 flower and you can expect a long 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.220
 the process of plant adaptation to the new 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.690
 place an imported plant besides 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.930
 more expensive than domestic 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.230
 what kind of plants choose your business in 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.980
 any case of frustration 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.820
 charming ppm you 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.820
 take out 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.800
 not
