and just from talking other people and
doing<00:00:20.250> research<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.029> believe<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:22.560> works

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
doing research I believe that what works

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
doing research I believe that what works
best<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.189> most<00:00:23.490> people<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> pretty<00:00:24.570> much

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
best for most people is to pretty much

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.490

plan<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.529> carbs<00:00:26.310> around<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.349> your

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
plan your carbs around you know your

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
plan your carbs around you know your
workouts<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.820> amount<00:00:29.910> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
workouts and you know the amount of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.279 
workouts and you know the amount of
energy<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.330> shouldn't<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.750> putting<00:00:30.929> out<00:00:31.109> for

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
energy that shouldn't be putting out for

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.819 
energy that shouldn't be putting out for
that<00:00:31.380> day<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.640> example<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:34.380> eat

that day so for example you would eat

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.060 
that day so for example you would eat
more<00:00:35.100> carbs<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.910> days<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.680> no

you<00:01:50.760> know<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:51.060> fat<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> next<00:01:52.470> meal

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830

thought<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:30.810> once<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.080> train<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.560> kind<00:02:31.740> of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
thought because once I train it kind of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.550 
thought because once I train it kind of
gives<00:02:31.890> me<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.280> extra<00:02:32.490> boost<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.150> energy

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
gives me like an extra boost of energy

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
gives me like an extra boost of energy
the<00:02:34.560> yogurt<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.790> sugar<00:02:36.090> in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
the yogurt and you know like a sugar in

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.660 
the yogurt and you know like a sugar in
the<00:02:36.690> yogurt<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:37.770> all<00:02:37.890> natural<00:02:38.040> sugar<00:02:38.460> so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the yogurt and it's all natural sugar so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.840 
the yogurt and it's all natural sugar so
i<00:02:38.850> would<00:02:39.030> also<00:02:39.180> got<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:39.690> eating<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.860> most<00:02:41.730> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
i would also got about eating it most of

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.640 
i would also got about eating it most of
the<00:02:41.910> time<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.750> gives<00:02:42.900> me<00:02:42.990> energy<00:02:43.020> like

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the time and it gives me energy like

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.400 
the time and it gives me energy like
good<00:02:43.830> energy<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.850> works<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:46.020> me<00:02:46.050> but

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
good energy so that works for me but

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.290 
good energy so that works for me but

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
you better be like Michael Phelps or

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.080 
you better be like Michael Phelps or

somebody or some
athlete<00:03:47.450> or<00:03:47.569> something<00:03:47.930> because<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.440> really

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
athlete or something because you really

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.259 
athlete or something because you really
don't<00:03:48.709> need<00:03:48.950> all<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.430> energy<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.910> lot<00:03:50.030> of

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
don't need all that energy a lot of

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.240 
don't need all that energy a lot of
times<00:03:50.480> we<00:03:51.019> don't<00:03:51.140> use<00:03:51.349> up<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.590> energy<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.099> then

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
times we don't use up the energy so then

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.009 
times we don't use up the energy so then
it<00:03:52.370> gets<00:03:52.430> stored<00:03:52.730> as<00:03:52.879> fat<00:03:52.910> which<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.720> what<00:03:53.930> i'm

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
it gets stored as fat which is what i'm

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.750 
it gets stored as fat which is what i'm
sure<00:03:54.230> most<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.680> already<00:03:54.980> know<00:03:55.129> it<00:03:55.640> gets

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
sure most you already know it gets

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.460 
sure most you already know it gets
stored<00:03:56.000> as<00:03:56.150> fat<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.690> then<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:57.200> manage

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
stored as fat and then we manage

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.449 
stored as fat and then we manage
ourselves<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:59.080> but<00:04:00.080> just<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.890> make<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.129> simple

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
ourselves so but just to make it simple

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.670 
ourselves so but just to make it simple
and<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:02.090> know<00:04:02.209> it's<00:04:02.390> better<00:04:02.629> for<00:04:03.019> like<00:04:03.170> fat

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
and you know it's better for like fat

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.640 
and you know it's better for like fat
burning<00:04:04.099> at<00:04:04.610> least<00:04:04.849> in<00:04:05.209> my<00:04:05.569> opinion<00:04:05.629> if<00:04:06.260> you

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
burning at least in my opinion if you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.140 
burning at least in my opinion if you
carb<00:04:06.950> cycle<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.519> then<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.700> keep<00:04:07.819> your<00:04:08.000> body

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
carb cycle and then you keep your body

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.850 
carb cycle and then you keep your body
guessing<00:04:08.450> your<00:04:09.230> body's<00:04:09.440> not<00:04:09.470> really<00:04:09.680> sure

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
guessing your body's not really sure

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.500 
guessing your body's not really sure
what<00:04:10.370> kind<00:04:10.549> of<00:04:10.640> sorts<00:04:10.849> of<00:04:10.879> energy<00:04:11.209> is<00:04:11.269> gonna<00:04:11.420> be

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
what kind of sorts of energy is gonna be

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.900 
what kind of sorts of energy is gonna be
using<00:04:11.720> for<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:12.230> know<00:04:12.349> each<00:04:12.560> day<00:04:12.830> that's<00:04:13.640> good

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
using for you know each day that's good

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.120
