00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
so once you've pulled out one of the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.530 
so once you've pulled out one of the
images<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.890> see<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:11.060> might<00:04:11.240> want<00:04:11.450> to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
images that you see you might want to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.860 
images that you see you might want to
look<00:04:12.500> around<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.250> image<00:04:13.460> and<00:04:14.030> try<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.660> give

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
look around that image and try to give

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.860 
look around that image and try to give
it<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.020> context<00:04:15.860> put<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.160> into<00:04:16.400> an<00:04:16.549> atmosphere

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
it a context put it into an atmosphere

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.900 
it a context put it into an atmosphere
so<00:04:17.870> here<00:04:18.350> I've<00:04:18.769> made<00:04:18.980> this<00:04:19.160> strange<00:04:19.640> creature

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
and I'm looking up at this line and it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.250 
and I'm looking up at this line and it
kind<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.550> starts<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.880> look<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.540> mountain

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
that you don't like go ahead and erase

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.130 
that you don't like go ahead and erase
them<00:05:38.170> charcoal<00:05:39.170> is<00:05:39.290> so<00:05:39.560> easy<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.460> control<00:05:40.610> and

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
them charcoal is so easy to control and

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.780 
them charcoal is so easy to control and
manipulate<00:05:42.140> and<00:05:42.410> so<00:05:42.590> it's<00:05:42.740> really<00:05:42.890> great<00:05:43.100> for

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
manipulate and so it's really great for

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.820 
manipulate and so it's really great for
creating<00:05:44.120> unexpected<00:05:44.920> worlds<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:47.830> any

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
creating unexpected worlds and any

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.540 
creating unexpected worlds and any
little<00:05:49.870> unresolved<00:05:50.870> odds<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:52.010> ends<00:05:52.160> on<00:05:52.490> the

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
little unresolved odds and ends on the

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.980 
little unresolved odds and ends on the
page<00:05:52.880> you<00:05:53.120> can<00:05:53.210> do<00:05:53.360> what<00:05:53.480> you<00:05:53.570> want<00:05:53.750> with<00:05:53.870> them

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
page you can do what you want with them

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.170
