GoPro<00:00:10.670> factory<00:00:11.670> suction<00:00:12.179> cup<00:00:12.360> mount<00:00:12.660> now<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
GoPro factory suction cup mount now the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.320 
GoPro factory suction cup mount now the
adjustments<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.730> stick<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
adjustments on this you stick it on the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
adjustments on this you stick it on the
car<00:00:16.730> loosen<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.850> knobs<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.650> then<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.859> can

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
car loosen these knobs and then you can

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.740 
car loosen these knobs and then you can
rotate<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.640> unit<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.800> rotate<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> head

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
rotate the unit like so rotate the head

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.640 
rotate the unit like so rotate the head
like<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:26.210> also<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:28.019> pivot<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> head

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
like so and also you can pivot the head

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.370 
like so and also you can pivot the head
up<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> down<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.779> found<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.990> really

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
up and down I found this really

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500 
up and down I found this really
inconvenient<00:00:32.130> sometimes<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
inconvenient sometimes when you want to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.110 
inconvenient sometimes when you want to
get<00:00:33.680> high<00:00:34.680> angle<00:00:35.040> low<00:00:35.219> angle<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.730> different

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
get high angle low angle just different

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.610 
get high angle low angle just different
shots<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> bit<00:00:37.890> frustrating<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
shots and this was a bit frustrating to

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.760 
shots and this was a bit frustrating to
work<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.940> suction<00:00:42.300> cup<00:00:42.480> however<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
work with the suction cup however it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
work with the suction cup however it
does<00:00:43.980> stick<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.600> still

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
does stick on really well and I still

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.680 
does stick on really well and I still
use<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> dent<00:00:46.739> puller<00:00:46.829> no<00:00:47.670> joke<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
use this as a dent puller no joke it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.950 
use this as a dent puller no joke it
works<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.449> now<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
works really well for that now this is

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
works really well for that now this is

what I replaced it with it's by a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.529 
what I replaced it with it's by a
company<00:00:54.239> called<00:00:54.570> RAM<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.850> made<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> USA

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
mounts for everything from GoPros to GPS

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.910

units to even police laptops so I wanted

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.320 
units to even police laptops so I wanted
to<00:01:08.040> give<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> guys<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.670> review<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to give you guys a little review of this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.399 
to give you guys a little review of this
unit<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.159> them<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.380> really<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
unit I have two of them and really I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
unit I have two of them and really I
couldn't<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.100> videos<00:01:14.400> without<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
couldn't do my videos without them so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.460 
couldn't do my videos without them so
here's<00:01:16.380> why<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.189> RAM<00:01:17.340> mounts<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:18.470> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
here's why the RAM mounts so good you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.999 
here's why the RAM mounts so good you
unscrew<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.159> screw<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> side<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
unscrew one screw on the side and you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.510 
unscrew one screw on the side and you
can<00:01:23.159> articulate<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> bottom<00:01:26.130> part<00:01:26.340> in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
can articulate the bottom part in

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.910 
can articulate the bottom part in
virtually<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.150> angles<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.259> top<00:01:28.470> part<00:01:28.770> as

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
virtually all angles and the top part as

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.539 
virtually all angles and the top part as
well<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:30.110> virtually<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.140> angles<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.799> in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
well in virtually all angles and in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.179 
well in virtually all angles and in
addition<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.750> has<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.229> ball

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
addition to that it has this little ball

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
addition to that it has this little ball
mount<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.030> GoPro<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.380> still

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
mount for your GoPro so you can still

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.120 
mount for your GoPro so you can still
pivot<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.640> GoPro<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:40.130> regardless

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
pivot your GoPro up and down regardless

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
pivot your GoPro up and down regardless
of<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.400> angle<00:01:41.700> shots<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.780> do

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
of what angle shots you need you can do

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
of what angle shots you need you can do
crazy<00:01:43.920> angles<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:46.040> like<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
crazy angles like like this if you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
crazy angles like like this if you
needed<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:49.049> especially<00:01:49.380> good<00:01:49.770> when

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
needed it it's especially good when

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.190 
needed it it's especially good when
getting<00:01:50.220> creative<00:01:50.700> shots<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.149> cars<00:01:51.479> when

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
getting creative shots on cars when

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
getting creative shots on cars when
dealing<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.619> different<00:01:53.430> car<00:01:53.610> windshields

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
dealing with different car windshields

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.109 
dealing with different car windshields
and<00:01:54.979> it's<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:57.119> better<00:01:57.329> than<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
and it's really a lot better than a

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.249 
and it's really a lot better than a
normal<00:02:00.119> amount<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.110> less

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
normal amount because it's less

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.810 
normal amount because it's less
constrictive<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.219> guys<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.670> more

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
constrictive and you guys can be more

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.149 
constrictive and you guys can be more
creative<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.500> wanted<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> show<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
creative so I just wanted to show you

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.459 
creative so I just wanted to show you
guys<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> RAM<00:02:06.540> mount<00:02:06.719> looks<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
guys what the RAM mount looks like and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.859 
guys what the RAM mount looks like and
tell<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.190> about<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:09.660> also

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.280 
tell you a little about it it's also
fairly<00:02:10.319> inexpensive<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:12.180> under<00:02:12.750> 50
