 ibiza is a trend at the moment 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.489
 style that you saw part back on 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.489
 this market 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.190

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.640
 by beach names from the ibiza te 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020

 they cost these vintage sunglasses 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.409
