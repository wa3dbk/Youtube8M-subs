00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.120
 5 reasons why you should give a girl in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.219
 rhythmic gymnastics 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 but firstly it's a healthy lifestyle 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.650
 this is a sport secondly your girl will 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.689
 possess some kind of plastic grace this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.359
 very principle probably helps life 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.760
 because a woman should bring herself 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 the operation of plastic femininity is 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.489
 rhythmic gymnastics is exactly 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.020
 gives you 3 of course 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.550
 character discipline appears because 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.920
 that first of all gymnastics is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.899
 sport tempers character 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.480
 discipline goes concentration in third 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.920
 if you are a professional athlete that 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 will you go personal sport in gymnastics 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 then of course a very big world opens 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 you start to drive you expand 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.449
 you make new acquaintances 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.270
 it becomes your life very 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.670
 interesting life for me gymnastics 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.460
 it became the meaning of life I think that if 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 man comes to 5 argument he himself 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 find what cons gymnastics can not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 confused gymnastics and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 artistic in artistic 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.619
 gymnastics will never go there with you 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 don't stop growing yet something yes 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 because we work on site with 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.380
 good, that is, we do not work on the balance beam 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 when you can somehow bed somewhere something 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 with the spine occurs yes if 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.720
 to look at gymnastics as easy 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.720
 conducting a healthy lifestyle and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.400
 just as a hobby, in principle, it does harm 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.090
 no will bring like any 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.189
 physical Culture 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 if you look at professional sports 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.850
 but you have to understand something and you go 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 wanna wanna wanna be some kind of injury 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.680
 because it is a constant stretch and you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.390
 cool joints that is from this nobody 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.180
 insured in principle yes you can go 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.710
 I'll fall down the street and tuck my foot in 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 gymnastics can you happen every 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.119
 day but you have to be ready for this and here 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.619
 How many girls do I know? 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.760
 Right so they came to us 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.100
 gymnastics ruined lives 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.730
 I will find such a person financial factor 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.650
 but you need to understand correctly for what 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.920
 you come sport if you want 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.530
 earn but choose sport where 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.180
 financial opportunities for sports more and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.630
 there are prize pools there too 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.830
 gymnastics of course not there super mega 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.840
 prize well, probably not so let's say 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.530
 super super popular sport 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.110
 still quite chamber and on 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.090
 competitions more often you can see something like that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.540
 parents of friends who are directly 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.820
 friends with you talking yes now sometimes 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 comes just to look at some 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.990
 aesthetic get pleasure but in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.510
 big cases if we donâ€™t already understand 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.250
 why there is no goal scored in heroic we 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.170
 just do not understand if just like that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.570
 we need to come next to it 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.730
 man and explained here it is 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.410
 therefore, such an assessment was mistaken because 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.110
 she can not lose but she can 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.880
 make a mistake when you want to give the child 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.390
 in artistic gymnastics that first 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.510
 I will say 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.090
 I want to tell parents of course you need 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.010
 trust the coach and in no case 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.690
 dictate your rules if you want 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.510
 dictate your rules need to look 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.790
 private school where you will pay 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.780
 money and there will be all your wishes 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.160
 taken into account 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.900
 that is, if you come to 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.160
 public institution in the dashvord 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.500
 let's say you need to trust the coach because 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.500
 the coach knows how to grow a champion like 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.280
 make a beautiful girl how to make 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.780
 worthy gymnast and second in any 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.390
 points you need to maintain your 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.370
 child because it will always be hard 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.790
 it's always painful to do splits and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.370
 stretched and a lot of babies go 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.650
 because but cannot endure and 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.420
 parents, of course, feel sorry for 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.190
 her baby well how does she come 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.920
 tears because mom me today 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.150
 stretched hurt me but this one 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.959
 it is necessary to endure the moment 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.360
 because yes it hurts but it's 2-3 years 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.250
 it will hurt then Taras will drag on and you 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.290
 be god it hurt look like 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.269
 there side by side babes crying and understand that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.579
 it will all pass and then you will be more 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.980
 thank you for learning this because 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.350
 what is necessary everywhere 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.680
 override this most important thing here 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.970
 need exactly the help of parents so that they 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.000
 persuaded the child somehow some 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.100
 motivation came up because i'm talking 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.400
 this is one goal game one trainer in 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.990
 it does not need to cope 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.950
 they said it would all pass 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.950
 only then it does not hurt
