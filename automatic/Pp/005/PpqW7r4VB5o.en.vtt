generator e leg bro static generator I
got<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> same

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
got it right what is it it's the same

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
got it right what is it it's the same
kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> machine<00:00:50.969> we're<00:00:51.210> using<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.660> make

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
kind of machine we're using to make

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
kind of machine we're using to make
smokestacks<00:00:52.590> cleaner<00:00:55.100> well<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.850> all

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
smokestacks cleaner well then I'm all

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.900 
smokestacks cleaner well then I'm all
for<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.780> even<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> does<00:00:58.980> make<00:00:59.309> peanuts

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
for it even if it does make peanuts

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.250 
for it even if it does make peanuts
float<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> air<00:01:01.219> how<00:01:02.219> does<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> work<00:01:03.260> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
float in the air how does it work it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.990 
float in the air how does it work it's
just<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> ways<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.820> using

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just one of the ways we're using

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.350 
just one of the ways we're using
electricity<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.900> clean<00:01:07.320> things<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.979> look<00:01:08.640> see

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
electricity to clean things up look see

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840 
electricity to clean things up look see
how<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.659> repels<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.409> peanuts<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.340> works<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
how it repels these peanuts it works the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
how it repels these peanuts it works the
same<00:01:11.880> way<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> smokestack<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.830> charge<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
same way in the smokestack we charge the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
same way in the smokestack we charge the
bad<00:01:14.610> parts<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> smoke<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.720> electricity

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
bad parts of the smoke with electricity

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.380 
bad parts of the smoke with electricity
and<00:01:16.619> collect<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> screen<00:01:17.880> before

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and collect them on the screen before

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.530 
and collect them on the screen before
they<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> air<00:01:20.270> does<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
they can get out into the air does that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.039 
they can get out into the air does that
really<00:01:21.869> work<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:23.369> sure<00:01:23.729> does<00:01:24.090> mr.<00:01:24.509> tooth<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
really work it sure does mr. tooth of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
really work it sure does mr. tooth of
course<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> lot<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:26.400> complicated<00:01:26.880> than

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
course it's a lot more complicated than

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
course it's a lot more complicated than
this<00:01:27.509> simple<00:01:27.780> model<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.009> very

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
this simple model and it's very

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
this simple model and it's very
expensive<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.840> being<00:01:31.079> used<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.710> now

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
expensive but it's being used right now

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.660 
expensive but it's being used right now
in<00:01:31.950> factories<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.060> plants<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.810> over

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
in factories and power plants all over

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.170 
in factories and power plants all over
