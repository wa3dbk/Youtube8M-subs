00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.229
 youtube or twitter can be changed more 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.479
 here is the name 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:10.500
 Ulyanov they have that we will not be well 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.400
 let's start doing the animation 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 to start your animation here here in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.340
 there is such an arrow in the lower right corner 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.490
 up click on it and then appear 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.630
 two such menus below and above let's 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.049
 look at the menu above you can go 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.200
 from here 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:37.920
 not to do the animation can be changed 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.390
 the thickness of our brush can change color 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 so let's make black you can choose 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:52.369
 here for example any of all these 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.369
 for example give a brush take here there 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:01.500
 audio here for example beauty from that of and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:06.030
 again the cartoon man goes here then 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.990
 you can again select the background color 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.620
 any light 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.310
 for example let's make yellow and out 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.250
 a photo 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.640
 well i will do yellow well and here is the help 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.070
 If you 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.120
 if you still have something you can not 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.460
 come here and everything is like that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.220
 English that is a pity here 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.370
 you can still take an eraser to 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.930
 for example drew 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.930
 You can erase this stick like this 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.980
 so let's often quickly erase 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.110
 here 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:12.599
 draw a man's man's 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:17.069
 for example hop and you drew a big 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:19.890
 arm's such a great note when 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.720
 big hand or anything not done 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.340
 so to duty it does not rub here 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.790
 top in the upper left there is such 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.680
 a button that removes what you 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.720
 now draw here for example spears 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.000
 I painted it can remove here and you can 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.730
 You can return it with a button 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.349
 which output top right 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.349
 not so no need let's draw 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.689
 man who goes 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.239
 worth it now let's see the bottom 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:59.209
 menu bottom menu can be viewed 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:02.400
 what kind of frame did you have here how many of them 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.030
 then you can view the cartoon delete 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.829
 frame 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.769
 copy the frame then return but 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.780
 look at the previous frame and see 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.060
 next frame 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.699
 Click this button and we draw 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:27.650
 next frame here we draw like this 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:30.650
 moved run away push the button from 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.650
 moves around 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.030
 so going frame 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:49.989
 next frame is my version 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:55.449
 free of course there are paid versions 

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:57.639
 but I will not buy it in free 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.539
 versions can be made only 20 frames 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.219
 so you don't plan on doing what 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:11.189
 great cartoons 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:11.189

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.860
 Luntik he we have from eight frames that 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.110

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.839
 and 8 8 out of 8 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.269

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:34.989
 any speed i always do on 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:42.699
 speeds 10 that's what we did 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:46.629
 man runs and that's all with the help of this 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:50.219
