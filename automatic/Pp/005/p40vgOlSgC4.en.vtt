00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.789 
hardtop and the ragtop version i chose
the<00:00:12.690> hardtop<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:13.530> i<00:00:13.559> think<00:00:13.620> it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the hardtop just because i think it

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.709 
the hardtop just because i think it
looks<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.009> lot<00:00:14.160> nicer<00:00:14.219> than<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> ragtop

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
looks a lot nicer than the ragtop

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.150 
looks a lot nicer than the ragtop
version<00:00:16.139> but<00:00:16.230> still<00:00:16.470> feels<00:00:16.680> like<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> right

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
version but still feels like the right

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.920 
version but still feels like the right
top<00:00:17.460> ES<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.880> definitely<00:00:18.240> pick<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.660> car

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
top ES and definitely pick up that car

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.140 
top ES and definitely pick up that car

about<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> car<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
about this car is you as you actually do

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
about this car is you as you actually do
pretty<00:01:23.909> good<00:01:24.000> drifts<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.600> car<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> mule
