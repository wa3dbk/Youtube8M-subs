00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:36.680 
into it and abilities he stays busy you
know<00:06:35.129> I<00:06:35.159> mean<00:06:35.339> like<00:06:35.490> my<00:06:35.820> dude<00:06:36.000> is<00:06:36.149> constantly

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690

I think it's one in situations where
it's<00:06:40.690> like<00:06:40.870> people<00:06:41.170> don't<00:06:41.890> really<00:06:42.100> you<00:06:42.370> know
