00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
grab both and hopefully this time I will

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.950 
grab both and hopefully this time I will
actually<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.529> damn<00:00:16.859> seventh<00:00:17.220> carefully

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960

and<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.150> difficulty<00:00:21.630> level<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.160> a<00:00:23.160> bit

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
and the difficulty level is a bit

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
and the difficulty level is a bit
tougher<00:00:24.300> than<00:00:24.480> arid<00:00:25.380> desert<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:26.189> not<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
tougher than arid desert it's not it is

tougher than arid desert it's not it is
it<00:00:27.720> looks<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.019> lot<00:00:28.140> harder<00:00:28.320> than<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.529> actually

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it looks a lot harder than it actually

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.260 
it looks a lot harder than it actually
is<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.340> um<00:00:30.859> it's<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.130> full<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> lava<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
is really um it's just full of lava and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.870 
is really um it's just full of lava and
slightly<00:00:33.780> tricky<00:00:34.110> platforming<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:35.280> earlier

slightly tricky platforming in earlier
versions<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.540> though<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.930> really

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
versions of it though it was really

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
version of the level the lava is solid

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.830 
version of the level the lava is solid
he<00:00:51.510> damages<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:53.000> touch<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.390> is

actually<00:00:55.050> solid<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.680> previous<00:00:56.550> versions<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
actually solid in previous versions it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
actually solid in previous versions it
was<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> deep<00:00:58.140> pit<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.620> damaging<00:00:59.039> water

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
was just a deep pit with damaging water

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.040 
was just a deep pit with damaging water
in<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.730> red<00:00:59.910> and<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> fell<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
in it that was red and if you fell in it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
in it that was red and if you fell in it
there<00:01:01.199> was<00:01:01.230> pretty<00:01:01.500> much<00:01:01.649> no<00:01:01.920> chance<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
there was pretty much no chance of you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
there was pretty much no chance of you
ever<00:01:02.430> getting<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
ever getting out and it was a bit of a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
ever getting out and it was a bit of a
claim<00:01:04.760> but<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> no<00:01:06.450> longer<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> case<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
claim but that is no longer the case I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.219 
claim but that is no longer the case I
am<00:01:07.650> taking<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.520> detour<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
am taking a bit of a detour here so that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
am taking a bit of a detour here so that
I<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> chaos<00:01:11.729> emerald<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.180> all

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
I can get this chaos emerald in all

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.110 
I can get this chaos emerald in all
these<00:01:12.420> range

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.640 

right<00:01:15.690> that's<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.170> opening<00:01:16.470> down

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
right that's the first opening down

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.930 
right that's the first opening down
there's<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> second<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
there's a second one that I know of that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.990 
there's a second one that I know of that
I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.510> grab<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.320> near<00:01:19.500> future<00:01:20.000> I'm

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I'm going to grab a very near future I'm

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.880 
I'm going to grab a very near future I'm
invincible<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.660> i<00:01:21.690> can<00:01:21.870> actually<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.590> out<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
invincible so i can actually get out of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.960 
invincible so i can actually get out of
here<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:25.160> what<00:01:26.160> I've<00:01:26.250> actually<00:01:26.400> done<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
here and what I've actually done here is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.350 
here and what I've actually done here is
I've<00:01:27.090> skipped<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.510> huge<00:01:27.840> section<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.410> level

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
I've skipped a huge section of a level

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.990 
I've skipped a huge section of a level
which<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.390> always<00:01:30.870> very<00:01:31.050> nice<00:01:31.880> nothing<00:01:32.880> too

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
which is always very nice nothing too

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.150 
which is always very nice nothing too
difficult<00:01:33.120> but<00:01:33.480> it<00:01:33.570> skip<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.870> but<00:01:34.080> that's<00:01:34.320> all

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
difficult but it skip I but that's all

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
make it to the platform there we go

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.140 
make it to the platform there we go
close<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.370> end<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.580> level<00:01:53.730> math<00:01:53.910> just

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
close to the end of the level math just

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.790 
close to the end of the level math just
a<00:01:54.210> short<00:01:54.450> jaunt<00:01:54.630> over<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:55.080> platforms<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
a short jaunt over these platforms and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.340 
a short jaunt over these platforms and
obviously<00:01:56.790> knuckles<00:01:57.120> tales<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.690> no<00:01:58.080> problem

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
obviously knuckles tales have no problem

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like there's a tricky section coming up

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.590 
like there's a tricky section coming up

flowing lava wall in it which is quite

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.410 
flowing lava wall in it which is quite
nifty<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:13.920> difficult<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.820> get<00:02:15.030> past<00:02:15.240> without

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
nifty but difficult to get past without

other ones are being able to take damage
and<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.269> end<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.480> local<00:02:26.720> it's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
and this is the end of a local it's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.880 
and this is the end of a local it's
quite<00:02:27.110> short<00:02:27.379> but<00:02:27.650> mostly<00:02:28.220> because<00:02:28.310> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
quite short but mostly because I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.339 
quite short but mostly because I
shanigan<00:02:30.890> my<00:02:31.099> way<00:02:31.220> past<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.870> level<00:02:33.110> doesn't

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
shanigan my way past the level doesn't

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.080 
shanigan my way past the level doesn't
trigger<00:02:33.530> straight<00:02:33.860> away<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.580> only<00:02:34.700> triggers

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
trigger straight away it only triggers

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.860 
trigger straight away it only triggers
after<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.569> volcano<00:02:35.959> erupts<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:38.330> time<00:02:38.720> for

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
after the volcano erupts so time for

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.070 
after the volcano erupts so time for
that<00:02:39.019> 70<00:02:39.500> special<00:02:39.860> stage<00:02:40.040> again<00:02:40.510> right
