00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello and welcome on how 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.410
 photograph points like today 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.480
 I told you about the difference 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 can have between a case with a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.009
 full frame full frame sensor 24,36 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.899
 like this one is an apc box that 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.630
 is going to be with a sensor a size 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:28.259
 much smaller so what a lot 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.450
 of people ask me questions about 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.230
 ask me for advice on 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.200
 tasks with 2 clicks 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 but taking optical focal lengths 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.130
 normal as if he had the 24 36 then 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.190
 that most of the time they go from 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.050
 nikon d3000 200 or cannon 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.420
 650d this kind of devices like the c1 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.190
 because we had to have a pc so the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.690
 sensor size is smaller which 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.199
 does that change the focal length of 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.359
 the goal 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.589
 so that for all the people who 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.000
 called me you really have to take it 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.699
 in account when we speak after a 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.479
 focal length for example a 18-55 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.560
 for an aps c it's not a 18-55 it's 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.850
 a 29 88 29 88 it's not the same thing 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.189
 as 18 55 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.689
 so why there is this gap that he 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.100
 be aware that the optics on 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.280
 the camera what the optics are 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.569
 round by definition so we're going to have 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 to make a move at home we will see 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.130
 something like that what we see 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.270
 it's that a full-sized sensor the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.159
 optics are made for 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.220
 cameras with sensors 24 36 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:34.619
 so after we will have our sensor that will 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.619
 be here 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:44.700
 so there we have a sensor 24 years 6 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:44.700
 full form then the psc him he will be there 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.969
 a lot smaller here is your 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.340
 aps c sensor 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.829
 and here is the full format sensor it's 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.689
 not the same thing and that's why he 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.700
 there is a difference in focal lengths 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.490
 Why 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.149
 18 55 will actually be a 18-55 on a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.170
 full frame case 24 36 and that's it 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.459
 why you will have 1.2988 instead 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.180
 from 18 55 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.890
 because the gap will have to multiply 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.640
 by 1 6 to go from the hall to that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.079
 this is the important thing to remember 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.060
 systematically when you have an abs 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.930
 and a more box that sticks 24 years if 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.090
 is that you want to buy a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 optical think to multiply the focal lengths 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.100
 sitting part like that it will give you 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 exactly what you actually have 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.639
 like when people talk about a 70 to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.069
 301 70-300 that will make sense 12480 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.989
 112 480 it's not the same as 70 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.269
 together so it's really important 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.400
 to take into account that kind of things 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.719
 that's a portrait I did on 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.959
 a picture full frame device 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.780
 so if I had an abs and that's what 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.609
 that it would have given me I do you there is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.469
 just done I made small marks 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:14.499
 it's going to go faster and it'll be more 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:16.469
 true this is it will give you an order 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:21.219
 of difference idea we can have 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:31.840
 between a full format camera is a 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:33.430
 device that is aps c so that's it 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.949
 is no longer the same picture so here is this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.169
 that you 're going to have with aps c then 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.709
 that with a performant we get there 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.680
 not the same thing 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.290
 that's going to explain why we're going 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.959
 to have his differences and this 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.310
 x 1.6 bah obligation here was this 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.989
 little video to explain the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.379
 difference i would say between the full 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.459
 format the full frame and the psc sail 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.959
 had cost I thank you for your 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.449
 attention and then if you have any 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.310
 questions if you have comments 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.009
 do not hesitate use the form a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.449
 little below me thank you for 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.400
 your attention and I tell you to very 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:15.329
 soon on how to photograph 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.329
 you
