00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the girls told today I bring you one 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 review and I'm super happy about this 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.059
 review because it is a positive review 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.190
 I'll move on to make negative reviews 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
 also new to let you know that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.839
 is out you do not like me know 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.630
 We all have different skin types 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.609
 different skin tones two we are 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 different but good I 'm not going to give 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.890
 my opinion about a product that is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 new but I have it for more or less 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 already a month if I'm not wrong but I use it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 every day since I got it I did not use anything 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 more and I really stayed super 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.329
 impressed super in love with everything 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.960
 So, well, I'll be talking to you 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.600
 about the great gift that we weeps them 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 makeup and see if the little boat the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.670
 I really loved packing 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.559
 a thousand times this the knob that does not have 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 pomp know the bases see blond 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 normally nothing has the only 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500
 has is the form and but this one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.489
 loved how wine is something different and from 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.760
 I really like how you see that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.790
 that is a 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.040
 up for this only the packaging first 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.020
 claims to stay in skin 24 hours a day 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.750
 draw is talking a little about that 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.280
 but good I am I am the 336 tone and 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.110
 good as they see you like this first I'm going to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.390
 talk about out later about the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.280
 product and things like that the only thing that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.700
 I do not like about this product is like 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.780
 can see outside of bercy but that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.610
 it's not the color you grab I'm going to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:45.170
 open come with this capital 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.000
 well and you open it and it comes with another me just 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.400
 I said I do not know why they put it if it's 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.120
 so it does not dry out something is not 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.220
 so the product as you can see is a lot 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.020
 more a little darker than it looks 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.540
 here outside I do not know if you can find out 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.870
 but if it is and I did realize this 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.460
 and well that's how you can see that nothing else was like that 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.110
 obvious you can feel the brush you can 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.800
 take out with your finger I do not know how you like 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.360
 I use my wife visibly so 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.180
 that had nothing to do with that my 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.670
 paintbrushes feel I know my roses 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.590
 they take out granites even if they are washed 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.950
 I know if it's the shampoo that I use to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.330
 wash them or I'll try to use one more 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:31.650
 natural so you already know that and that's it 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.960
 claim to be 24 hours a day I really 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.660
 in my skin I have a foot 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.970
 combination is not so fat 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.560
 wao I have all day really 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.540
 I was super impressed with this I do not know 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.520
 yes 24 hours a day because long full not 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.770
 you go as you want 24 hours a day 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.290
 only always more are about six 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.390
 hours that use loquitos makeup or already 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.880
 would have put about 12 now at 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.990
 stress or I do not know but good is claimed 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.970
 on your sites and we're going to check the 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.100
 site of truth there always teach the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.160
 new products say it's good for 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.200
 the summer that is is not going to 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.480
 transfer nothing are clothing or anything from 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.120
 this that almost always the products 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.020
 from berlin its bases say that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.180
 I really did not have any problem 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.120
 with that he has changed me with a makeup 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.070
 and it has not stained my clothes or anything 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.230
 that and that today that I bring white only 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.230
 I did that and nothing happened, I am already 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.560
 I always 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.250
 I know it with a powder and siprus or 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.879
 from yesterday's home yes but this is not 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.440
 it's like leaving your face shiny 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.250
 if they look like some bases it's not not 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.410
 intentionally that they have the face 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.989
 bright but they are not mate this for 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.720
 me is where I do not know if it's completely 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.299
 mate but it does not leave me this shine alone 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.340
 I can go out without putting on that dust, that's 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.409
 very good because it is in your dust and 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.620
 more in the summer I do not want to get 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.640
 so much truth and with little I have 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.870
 you know that you have had tests with 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.090
 scars but we almost do not have 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.620
 problems or it's not like that but 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.739
 I also like it because for me it is 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.420
 maximum sugar berge coverage much 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.769
 people listening or telling me that it is not 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.140
 look to see if it is minimal 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:17.039
 for me it's a cabaret, I like them 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.979
 to the times that Berge focuses and that's it 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.570
 yes for you is not looking for age then to the 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.610
 memory I'm applying more or I do not know 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.690
 but for me with a brush or with the virus 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.260
 iron is left to me as well as super 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.760
 and that part is not heavy, I think 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.730
 that this is going to be my base of all 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.640
 days because base every day was 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.090
 the one to go back and see the cndh but now 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.630
 it is very white or I do not wear it but 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.390
 is my super love or I'm 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.400
 completely in this and it cost me 13 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.290
 dollars in mougins but it's because it's 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.880
 new is obvious and then they will lower it 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.280
 of price and our part is found 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.510
 in mom and so far it's always 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.720
 super good in lovely the smell the smell 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.950
 it's not color like the stay nothing to see 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.950
 but it does have a smell 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.920
 I mean 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.630
 I do not know I do not know the beams of berlÃ£n have 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.660
 always like a smell but it's not a smell 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.750
 ugly is less strong than the east 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.750
 because the bottom one and if it's a bit 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.750
 clown 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.010
 I like it is not so bad but good 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.200
 if you want a video about how I apply 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.840
 this base let me know below and be the 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.420
 I'm going to teach like that it's super super soft and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.790
 nothing hard is very handy you can 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.210
 blur very very well as you can see 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.460
 the finish is very nice 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.760
 this misfortune that they are fanatical of 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.790
 bases of truth these I recommend them 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.290
 a lot and the truth I was super 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.620
 impressed I thought that I will not like 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.460
 and wow I stayed super as I tell you 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.790
 from this base I give you a 10 because of 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.920
 I really loved the 24 hours I did not 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.480
 I can say if it lasts 24 hours but if 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.790
 last many girls really goes to 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.400
 help for those I know they tell us today 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.690
 in the summer do not use makeup but I 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.490
 I know there are girls who do it 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.370
 I do if I do not go to the beach 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.950
 true but obviously I go out in the summer and 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.080
 I wear makeup not so much but if I 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.720
 I put all this is very good for that if 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.900
 you want it not to melt or anything 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.580
 that and more apart you will not be diminished 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.800
 because I know that many 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.379
 they diminish you but also all that 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.319
 it has to do with skin now if you have 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.330
 Dry and obvious skin always uses a shelf 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.759
 before using any skin product 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.689
 even if you have oily skin all over and I think 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:51.370
 that this will work for everyone does not say 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.840
 do not claim as local are you like 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.860
 those who have all have one for 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.710
 normal and combination and you will pay and so 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.780
 is I think I would do it would help them 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.419
 those with dry skin and you will also feel them 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.729
 I'm fat I do not know about that but I really 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.080
 I highly recommend it since it has it 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.060
 for a dollar less I think it's good 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.060
 because that water vince is always more 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.520
 expensive or I loved I was fascinated by this base 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.400
 I recommend it a lot very much it's a 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.080
 of my favorites now and of course 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.240
 that they will see it in my favorites of 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.750
 June, you know, I hope you liked it
