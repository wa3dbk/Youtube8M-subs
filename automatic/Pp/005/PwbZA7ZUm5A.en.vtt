of<00:02:02.600> course<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.869> costs<00:02:03.229> seven<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.670> SERPs<00:02:04.970> is<00:02:05.150> a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
of course it costs seven the SERPs is a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.610 
of course it costs seven the SERPs is a
new<00:02:05.330> car<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.810> game<00:02:05.960> includes<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.530> you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
new car that the game includes that you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.259 
new car that the game includes that you
can<00:02:06.770> substitute<00:02:06.979> for<00:02:07.340> one<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.550> your<00:02:07.670> pins<00:02:08.000> in

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
can substitute for one of your pins in

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.140 
can substitute for one of your pins in
the<00:02:08.959> basic<00:02:09.350> deck<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:10.399> basically<00:02:10.790> gives<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.090> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the basic deck it basically gives you a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.410 
the basic deck it basically gives you a
plus<00:02:11.390> 1by<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.890> gold<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.459> but<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.239> still

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
plus 1by and one gold and but it still

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.990 
plus 1by and one gold and but it still
just<00:02:14.450> gives<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> pawn<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.769> game<00:02:16.000> now

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
just gives you a pawn in the game now

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.160 
just gives you a pawn in the game now
let's<00:02:17.209> take<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.330> look<00:02:17.510> at<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.720> new<00:02:17.870> pieces

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
let's take a look at the new pieces

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.340 
let's take a look at the new pieces
first<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.130> here<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.970> skirmisher<00:02:20.720> now

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
first we have here the skirmisher now

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.890 
first we have here the skirmisher now
the<00:02:21.410> skirmisher<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> pretty<00:02:23.180> weak<00:02:23.540> piece

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the skirmisher is a pretty weak piece

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.789 
the skirmisher is a pretty weak piece
actually<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:26.030> go<00:02:26.239> straight<00:02:26.780> one<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
actually the it can go straight one and

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.780 
actually the it can go straight one and
or<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:29.120> go<00:02:29.320> diagonally<00:02:30.320> backwards<00:02:30.640> but<00:02:31.640> when

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
or can go diagonally backwards but when

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.460 
or can go diagonally backwards but when
it<00:02:31.880> captures<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.390> can<00:02:32.660> only<00:02:32.750> capture<00:02:33.019> straight

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
it captures it can only capture straight

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.070 
it captures it can only capture straight
ahead<00:02:33.590> or<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.519> like<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> pawn<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.930> that's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
ahead or this like a pawn so that's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.970 
ahead or this like a pawn so that's
that's<00:02:36.590> kind<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:37.250> useful<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.269> back-up

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that's kind of useful the back-up

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.630 
that's kind of useful the back-up
ability<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.220> card

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
ability of the card

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.940 
ability of the card
which<00:02:41.180> lets<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.450> draw<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> card<00:02:41.780> plus<00:02:42.290> 1by<00:02:42.680> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
which lets you draw a card plus 1by and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.280 
which lets you draw a card plus 1by and
you<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.220> discard<00:02:43.940> 3<00:02:44.209> cards<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:44.870> +1<00:02:45.260> gold

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
you can discard 3 cards for +1 gold

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.920 
you can discard 3 cards for +1 gold
that's<00:02:45.680> more<00:02:46.070> useful<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:47.209> again<00:02:47.330> this

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
that's more useful but then again this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.470 
that's more useful but then again this
only<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.560> skirmisher<00:02:48.980> only<00:02:49.190> costs<00:02:49.549> 2<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.299> put

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
only the skirmisher only costs 2 to put

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.600 
only the skirmisher only costs 2 to put
that<00:02:50.660> card<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.170> deck<00:02:51.350> let's<00:02:52.160> look<00:02:52.340> at<00:02:52.430> some

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
that card in the deck let's look at some

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.070 
that card in the deck let's look at some
really<00:02:53.180> let's<00:02:53.510> look<00:02:53.600> at<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> really<00:02:53.870> weird

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
really let's look at a really weird

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.570 
really let's look at a really weird
piece<00:02:54.290> here's<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.860> day<00:02:55.160> Rider

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
piece here's a day Rider

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.400 
piece here's a day Rider
which<00:02:56.120> makes<00:02:56.510> me<00:02:56.630> think<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.870> blade<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
which makes me think it's blade on a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.130 
which makes me think it's blade on a
horse<00:02:57.650> but<00:02:57.860> anyhow<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:59.209> day<00:02:59.390> rider<00:02:59.660> can<00:02:59.900> just

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
horse but anyhow the day rider can just

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.699 
horse but anyhow the day rider can just
go<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.850> spaces<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.480> any<00:03:02.600> direction<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.380> he<00:03:03.530> can

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
go to spaces in any direction so he can

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.400 
go to spaces in any direction so he can
do<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:04.120> jewel<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.510> he<00:03:05.570> can<00:03:05.720> keep<00:03:05.840> going<00:03:05.900> or

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
do this jewel but he can keep going or

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.590 
do this jewel but he can keep going or
you<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:06.680> diagonal<00:03:07.100> boom<00:03:07.250> boom<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.450> can

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
you know diagonal boom boom and it can

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.210 
you know diagonal boom boom and it can
jump<00:03:08.840> over<00:03:09.049> other<00:03:09.260> pieces<00:03:09.380> which<00:03:09.889> makes<00:03:10.100> it

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
jump over other pieces which makes it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.490 
jump over other pieces which makes it
very<00:03:10.280> useful<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:11.180> get<00:03:11.959> over<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.290> board

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
very useful to get over the board

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.660 
very useful to get over the board
because<00:03:12.680> any<00:03:12.799> piece<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.040> can<00:03:13.400> jump<00:03:13.760> has<00:03:14.359> an

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
because any piece that can jump has an

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.309 
because any piece that can jump has an
as<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.849> nice<00:03:15.060> ability<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.660> problem<00:03:16.020> of<00:03:16.140> course

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
as a nice ability the problem of course

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.130 
as a nice ability the problem of course
is<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:18.030> know<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.300> also<00:03:18.510> limits<00:03:18.840> him

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
is that you know that also limits him

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.140 
is that you know that also limits him
and<00:03:19.319> players<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:19.890> see<00:03:20.190> pretty<00:03:20.700> much<00:03:20.819> exactly

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
and players can see pretty much exactly

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.180 
and players can see pretty much exactly
where<00:03:21.450> he's<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:22.010> except<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.099> have

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
where he's going to go except you have

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.710 
where he's going to go except you have
that<00:03:23.310> hopping<00:03:23.760> ability<00:03:24.120> almost<00:03:24.420> call<00:03:24.630> them

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
that hopping ability almost call them

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
that hopping ability almost call them
the<00:03:24.810> rabbit<00:03:25.260> now<00:03:26.250> cooler<00:03:26.970> than<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.540> one<00:03:27.750> I

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the rabbit now cooler than that one I

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.960 
the rabbit now cooler than that one I
think<00:03:28.110> though<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:29.010> changeling<00:03:29.580> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
think though is the changeling the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.510 
think though is the changeling the
changeling<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> whatever<00:03:31.380> piece<00:03:31.770> there<00:03:32.130> next

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
changeling is whatever piece there next

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.180 
changeling is whatever piece there next
to<00:03:32.700> any<00:03:33.030> adjacent<00:03:33.660> piece<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.860> know<00:03:35.069> if

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
to any adjacent piece so you know if

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.410 
to any adjacent piece so you know if
you're<00:03:35.310> next<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:35.880> more<00:03:36.209> powerful

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
you're next to other more powerful

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.630 
you're next to other more powerful
pieces<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.680> will<00:03:37.800> be<00:03:37.860> able<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.220> move<00:03:38.370> like

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
pieces you will be able to move like

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.430 
pieces you will be able to move like
them<00:03:38.850> too<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.420> here<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.720> changeling<00:03:40.110> can<00:03:40.260> move

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
them too so here the changeling can move

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.500 
them too so here the changeling can move
like<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.250> day<00:03:41.430> rider<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:42.030> move<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
like the day rider can move like the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.420 
like the day rider can move like the
Prophet<00:03:42.989> oh<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.830> I've<00:03:43.920> been<00:03:43.950> expecting

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
Prophet oh you know I've been expecting

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.030

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
nice the caravan is a really interesting

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.270 
nice the caravan is a really interesting
piece<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.569> very<00:03:54.900> powerful<00:03:55.410> at<00:03:55.500> all<00:03:55.560> it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
piece it's not very powerful at all it

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.800 
piece it's not very powerful at all it
can<00:03:56.459> move<00:03:56.640> one<00:03:57.209> or<00:03:57.269> two<00:03:57.560> spaces<00:03:58.790> forward

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
can move one or two spaces forward

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.210 
can move one or two spaces forward
except<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.870> have<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> pay<00:04:01.200> money<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:02.010> that

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
except you have to pay money to do that

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.820 
except you have to pay money to do that
and<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:03.269> can<00:04:03.450> always<00:04:03.600> attack<00:04:04.110> straight<00:04:04.470> one

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
and you can always attack straight one

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.190 
and you can always attack straight one
so<00:04:05.700> why<00:04:05.880> would<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.090> ever<00:04:06.209> do<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.959> sort<00:04:07.140> of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
so why would you ever do that sort of

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.720 
so why would you ever do that sort of
thing<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.440> mean<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.620> can<00:04:07.709> go<00:04:07.830> straight<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.549> any

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
thing I mean it can go straight in any

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.070 
thing I mean it can go straight in any
direction<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.269> have<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.450> pay<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.690> move<00:04:09.930> it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
direction but you have to pay to move it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.020 
direction but you have to pay to move it
the<00:04:10.590> thing<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:11.040> while<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:11.489> deployed<00:04:11.790> you're

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the thing is while it's deployed you're

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.539 
the thing is while it's deployed you're
always<00:04:12.299> plus<00:04:12.540> two<00:04:12.720> gold<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.920> always<00:04:14.280> having

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
always plus two gold so always having

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.180 
always plus two gold so always having
that<00:04:14.850> ability<00:04:15.330> out<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:15.989> board<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.530> get

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
that ability out in the board to get

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.270 
that ability out in the board to get
extra<00:04:17.729> money<00:04:17.760> will<00:04:18.299> tempt<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.930> buy<00:04:19.140> these

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
extra money will tempt you to buy these

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.920 
extra money will tempt you to buy these
the<00:04:20.280> problem<00:04:20.789> is<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.209> know<00:04:21.329> your<00:04:21.570> opponent's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the problem is you know your opponent's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.090 
the problem is you know your opponent's
going<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.140> come<00:04:22.289> after<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.740> piece<00:04:22.919> because

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
going to come after that piece because

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.460 
going to come after that piece because
it's<00:04:23.370> giving<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.729> extra<00:04:24.060> money<00:04:24.330> then<00:04:25.320> we

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
it's giving you that extra money then we

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.890 
it's giving you that extra money then we
have<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.800> lightning<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.970> lightning<00:04:27.450> can

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
have the lightning the lightning can

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.969 
have the lightning the lightning can
always<00:04:28.229> leap<00:04:28.789> going<00:04:29.789> here<00:04:30.090> or<00:04:31.080> backwards<00:04:31.680> two

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
always leap going here or backwards two

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.680 
always leap going here or backwards two
spaces<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.729> like<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.000> other<00:04:33.120> one<00:04:33.330> or<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:33.570> can

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
spaces just like the other one or it can

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.440 
spaces just like the other one or it can
go<00:04:33.900> diagonally<00:04:34.380> over<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.789> back<00:04:35.940> it<00:04:36.120> can't<00:04:36.300> go

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
go diagonally over and back it can't go

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.450 
go diagonally over and back it can't go
sideways<00:04:36.750> -<00:04:37.200> it's<00:04:37.620> kind<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.890> limited<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.400> that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
sideways - it's kind of limited in that

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.480 
sideways - it's kind of limited in that
regard<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.750> also<00:04:39.930> lets<00:04:40.229> you<00:04:40.380> give<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:41.130> plus

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
regard but it also lets you give do plus

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.850 
regard but it also lets you give do plus
one<00:04:41.789> more<00:04:42.030> order<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:43.110> it's<00:04:43.350> kind<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.680> an

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
one more order so it's kind of like an

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.000 
one more order so it's kind of like an
extra<00:04:44.070> thing<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.820> do<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.360> it's<00:04:46.260> order<00:04:46.710> card

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
extra thing to do and it's order card

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.219 
extra thing to do and it's order card
which<00:04:47.520> lets<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.850> capture<00:04:48.090> any<00:04:48.570> unit<00:04:49.110> that's

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
which lets you capture any unit that's

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.350 
which lets you capture any unit that's
adjacent<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.800> one<00:04:49.919> of<00:04:50.010> your<00:04:50.070> pious<00:04:50.370> units<00:04:50.850> is<00:04:51.000> a

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
adjacent to one of your pious units is a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.210 
adjacent to one of your pious units is a
very<00:04:51.750> powerful<00:04:52.050> card<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:52.950> why<00:04:53.100> this

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
very powerful card and that's why this

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.060 
very powerful card and that's why this
one<00:04:53.460> costs<00:04:53.760> five<00:04:54.110> now<00:04:55.110> here's<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.380> very<00:04:55.440> unusual

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
one costs five now here's a very unusual

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.719 
one costs five now here's a very unusual
piece<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.550> idle<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:58.169> idle<00:04:58.470> can't<00:04:58.919> move<00:04:59.070> can't

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
piece the idle the idle can't move can't

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.690 
piece the idle the idle can't move can't
attack<00:05:00.000> it's<00:05:00.570> just<00:05:00.990> there<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:02.340> why<00:05:02.490> would<00:05:02.669> you

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
attack it's just there so why would you

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.300 
attack it's just there so why would you
want<00:05:02.789> it<00:05:03.150> well<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.990> card<00:05:04.260> costs<00:05:04.650> five<00:05:04.890> and

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
want it well the card costs five and

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.810 
want it well the card costs five and
it's<00:05:06.210> basically<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:07.280> sovereign<00:05:08.280> piece<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:08.700> it's

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
it's basically a sovereign piece so it's

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.610 
it's basically a sovereign piece so it's
another<00:05:09.030> King<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:09.930> essence<00:05:10.229> that<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:10.380> can

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
another King in essence that you can

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.190 
another King in essence that you can
defend<00:05:10.950> easy<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:12.060> get<00:05:12.210> on<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.450> board<00:05:12.630> easy<00:05:13.020> to

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
defend easy to get on the board easy to

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.870 
defend easy to get on the board easy to
add<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.740> actually<00:05:14.190> think<00:05:14.430> though<00:05:14.580> that<00:05:14.760> the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
add I actually think though that the

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.640 
add I actually think though that the
action<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.389> better<00:05:15.539> where<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.229> can<00:05:16.380> trash<00:05:16.620> a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
action is better where you can trash a

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.409 
action is better where you can trash a
card<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.100> get<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.250> card<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.639> cost<00:05:17.880> up<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.150> five

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
card and get a card that cost up to five

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.250 
card and get a card that cost up to five
more<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.760> it's<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.000> idle<00:05:21.360> now<00:05:21.690> we<00:05:21.750> have<00:05:22.050> the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
more so it's the idle now we have the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.899 
more so it's the idle now we have the
profit<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.770> one<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:22.890> showed<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.340> earlier<00:05:23.370> the

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
profit the one I showed you earlier the

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.510 
profit the one I showed you earlier the
profit<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.960> kind<00:05:25.320> of<00:05:25.349> like<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.500> wiggling<00:05:26.070> guy<00:05:26.310> he

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
profit is kind of like a wiggling guy he

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.770 
profit is kind of like a wiggling guy he
can<00:05:26.700> ride<00:05:26.880> d'agneau

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
can ride d'agneau

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.810

turning<00:05:28.780> 90<00:05:29.110> degrees<00:05:29.410> so<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:30.190> profit<00:05:30.610> moves

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820

and<00:07:11.500> the<00:07:11.590> guys<00:07:11.740> who<00:07:11.890> zigzag<00:07:12.700> around<00:07:12.820> there's<00:07:13.360> a

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
and the guys who zigzag around there's a

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.660 
and the guys who zigzag around there's a
lot<00:07:13.540> here<00:07:13.750> of<00:07:13.900> just<00:07:14.050> continually<00:07:14.920> moving<00:07:15.460> and

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
lot here of just continually moving and

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.730 
lot here of just continually moving and
again<00:07:16.210> as<00:07:16.450> I<00:07:16.810> said<00:07:17.020> about<00:07:17.170> the<00:07:17.290> original<00:07:17.440> game

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
again as I said about the original game

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.960 
again as I said about the original game
it<00:07:17.860> kind<00:07:17.980> of<00:07:18.040> warps<00:07:18.310> your<00:07:18.460> brain<00:07:18.640> thinking

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
it kind of warps your brain thinking

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.670 
it kind of warps your brain thinking
about<00:07:19.120> all<00:07:19.270> the<00:07:19.420> possibilities<00:07:20.050> this<00:07:20.470> one

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
about all the possibilities this one

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.920 
about all the possibilities this one
just<00:07:20.890> continues<00:07:21.580> with<00:07:21.790> the<00:07:21.880> mind-warping<00:07:22.450> you

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
just continues with the mind-warping you

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.960 
just continues with the mind-warping you
can<00:07:23.110> chuck<00:07:23.320> the<00:07:23.470> box<00:07:23.680> everything<00:07:24.400> that<00:07:24.730> was<00:07:24.850> in

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
can chuck the box everything that was in

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.210 
can chuck the box everything that was in
the<00:07:25.060> original<00:07:25.150> box<00:07:25.600> does<00:07:25.930> fit<00:07:26.230> and<00:07:26.470> the<00:07:26.680> I<00:07:26.950> mean

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220 
the original box does fit and the I mean

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.130 
the original box does fit and the I mean
everything<00:07:27.490> in<00:07:27.580> the<00:07:27.610> expansion<00:07:28.060> box<00:07:28.180> fits<00:07:28.900> in

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.140 
everything in the expansion box fits in

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.550 
everything in the expansion box fits in
the<00:07:29.320> original<00:07:29.800> box<00:07:30.040> fine<00:07:30.690> so<00:07:31.690> and<00:07:32.260> it<00:07:32.350> from

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
the original box fine so and it from

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.050 
the original box fine so and it from
what<00:07:32.770> it<00:07:32.860> sounds<00:07:33.190> like<00:07:33.220> this<00:07:33.520> is<00:07:33.700> only<00:07:33.880> the

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060 
what it sounds like this is only the

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.020 
what it sounds like this is only the
first<00:07:34.420> expansion<00:07:35.410> to<00:07:35.680> this<00:07:35.800> game<00:07:36.070> so<00:07:36.100> but<00:07:36.910> it's

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
first expansion to this game so but it's

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.620 
first expansion to this game so but it's
a<00:07:37.120> good<00:07:37.300> one
