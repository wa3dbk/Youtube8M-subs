00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.170
 looking impossible for my dream fulfilled 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 fever in gold 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.529
 Friday at 10 o'clock at night only 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.050
 discovery chanel gold makes us dream 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.169
 but it also awakens our side more 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.000
 dark the sea ambition is nobody in a 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.090
 world full of dangers where the only 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.129
 limit is death the gold fishing the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.119
 Friday at 11 at night only the 

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.119
 seen see and chanel 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 you are neighbor of houses of benitez but 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.650
 bring the grapes here and bring them here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.220
 and that's because he made that decision, yes 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.480
 because here the fruits are defended very 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.930
 all right 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.540
 both the grains and the grape and this is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 why believe that , as is the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.379
 this year's campaign like you the grape 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 because the grapes at the end after these 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 the heats that we have had is not 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.339
 turning out badly there in my area 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.510
 around here in this area and very little grape 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.309
 but the whites that 's a lot to the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 people that will sell with or wrong but for 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.420
 there we remember bad because the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.270
 heat that has made the fruit that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.040
 be small clear clear has not done what 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 what I had to do I'm referring 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.340
 to the Texan because what is required comes out better 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.500
 you have your vineyard is unirrigated 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 radiobases leave them all left and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.509
 still has the traditional pineapple in 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.270
 glass and the three and some wines in clay and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.340
 take it manually as always 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 let's see to explain what it is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.789
 What is this process of 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.890
 wine making since the arrival of 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.750
 fruit until it appears in our 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.160
 bottle on the table that is what gives us 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.050
 that you do not see mobile phones 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.509
 we start here by the piquera here 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.490
 in the piquera pardon the grape is collected 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.170
 in the hoppers in what is the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.780
 properly said 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.960
 lowers a destemmer that separates the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 scrape of grains and grains 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 with the must go to a pump that sends 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.090
 He came directly through the pipes 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.229
 until the wine verifiers where 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.509
 spends 34 days depends on the musts up 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.390
 that already comes out practically we're not going 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.910
 to go finished but you already know how wine has 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.190
 previously collected the white water and 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 now picking indistinctly this 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.150
 year have been collected in white 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.930
 varieties that are not native to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.500
 put it like that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.659
 chardÃ³n the verdejo the muscat 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.659
 although if it is from the area it is very early 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.129
 and it is still to pick up the air in the area 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.900
 from here that starts today is the first 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.469
 day of white as affected the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.079
 climatology and that hot summer not at 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.049
 good water because the truth is that it has been 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.849
 a very long summer because it is we remember 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.480
 since May and some 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.129
 very high temperatures and we drag a 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.079
 winter drought also considerable 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.670
 and good the vineyard precisely what 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.609
 needs is above all the vineyard of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.500
 dry land is to collect water during the 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.569
 winter to then be able to take the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.489
 production during the summer has been 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.780
 a drought as I say very long first 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.189
 place in winter that did not rain what 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.260
 enough and then summer well well a 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.379
 summer very dry and very hot that 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.299
 quality terms the product is going to be 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.219
 well it's being very good but 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.709
 performance effects the decrease the 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.010
 we estimate around 30 percent in 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.010
 some cases
