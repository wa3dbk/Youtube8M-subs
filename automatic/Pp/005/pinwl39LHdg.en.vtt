00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 hello good guys found in this one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.170
 new episode of iphoneitalia hot news 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.560
 hello good guys found in this one 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.330
 new episode I'll tell you right away 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.980
 sorry for the style of this video 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.990
 different from note because I'm recording 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.700
 with the old camera in an old one 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.560
 setup then probably the quality 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.779
 it won't be as good as the last ones 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 unfortunately, today, video went like this 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.630
 at least in any case I am 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.820
 recording from a camera of a 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.440
 certain type so we can start with 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 the main news of this 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.010
 apple world week 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 then guys the first news today 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.329
 is what concerns the apple title 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.620
 which continues to break the record on 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.450
 record now seems almost to be 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.070
 become an appointment I do not say 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.170
 daily but weekly now on 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.670
 new record of almost 130 dollars for 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.320
 action remembered that there was a split 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.050
 of the shares they would therefore have 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.670
 achieved even higher prices if 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 there was not this division 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.269
 of the shares then apple continues to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.590
 not only break the record on record 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.030
 from the sales point of view but 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.610
 also in this case from the point of view 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 of the value of his shares on the stock exchange 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 the second news concerns the batteries 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.829
 not only for iphone but for all 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.720
 technological devices because it was 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.240
 made a very interesting discovery that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.619
 could finally lead to years later 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.869
 an improvement of the situation for 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.700
 regarding batteries in general 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.319
 in fact some researchers who on the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.640
 alzheimer's disease have discovered one 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.189
 particular molecule that if 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.100
 properly treated allows the 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.780
 recharge a battery in a minute 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.240
 only boys a fabulous thing 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.369
 it would really be something 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.810
 spectacular fast recharge 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.490
 which would allow us to stick in 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.049
 any time at a hold of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.119
 current to get 100 percent of 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.259
 charge on our device reducing 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.700
 so at the most 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.499
 the need to use batteries 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.530
 external to attach to these batteries 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:55.539
 external for 23 hours maybe the whole thing 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.700
 in short, in a very fast very 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.200
 light and also very simple there 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 instead we move to jailbreak 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.990
 because this was the week in 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.420
 which has been released a non jailbreak 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.770
 for one of the latest versions of ios ma 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.560
 for one of the versions of ios that is not 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.770
 still public or ios 8.2 beta 2 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.200
 only for mac and ios 8.2 beta 1 and see 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.550
 two only for windows windows 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.709
 we can jailbreak on both 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.430
 Mac- only versions 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.110
 on version 2 of ios 8.2 bet all in 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.150
 substance this is a version 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 modified jailbreak pp 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.019
 the break we had already seen for the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.290
 previous versions of ios pot jailbreak 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.670
 realized by the team separated by time 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.780
 while doing precisely with regard to the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 windows version was just right 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.849
 released type jailbreak for ios 8.2 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.349
 beta 1 and beta 2 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.420
 so as usual if you want to follow 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.980
 jailbreak now find the guides 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.989
 complete, however, remember that the beta are 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.280
 only for developers and therefore if not 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.680
 you are a developer you do not have access 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.510
 to beta very little since the launch of 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.879
 apple work that seems more and more 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.459
 next has been announced on 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.190
 new pebble time the pebble company of the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.739
 first pebble classic of the pebble steel 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.930
 has in fact officially published the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.340
 information and also the images 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.769
 in short, all the pre has already started 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.840
 order pre order which was one thing 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.450
 amazing guys because these guys 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.730
 this startup that now has a lot of start up 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.739
 no longer wanted to reach 500 thousand 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.310
 financing dollars to support 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.019
 the kickstarter project in a period 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.349
 of indefinite time years have reached 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.090
 Then 5 million less than a day then 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.459
 project went absolutely to 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.310
 large as usual because 3 bondone 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.410
 new kickstarter but talking about the pebble 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.419
 time is for the first time of a 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.160
 color pub with multiple color screen 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.409
 lighter thinner with a design 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.090
 questionable I don't like it much though 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.949
 with some features a bit smarter than there 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.290
 they basically wanted the timeline now 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.760
 it is a very beautiful thing done well 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.579
 thought well in facebook style though 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.379
 we want with all our commitments that 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.879
 are shown in this timeline 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.220
 pressing the lower buttons let's go 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.569
 on future events while pressing the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.190
 central button in that case there 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.930
 we place all this on the present 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.030
 in addition to watch applications 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.470
 space that pebble had already developed into 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.669
 plus this for ball time allows you to 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.500
 respond to notifications in a way 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.989
 simple directly through the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.489
 integrated microphone the price of 199 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.199
 dollars the battery is always the same 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.430
 then from seven days duration 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.039
 excellent 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.449
 who knows how apple will answer this 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.849
 time since that pebble is undoubtedly it 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.949
 best selling best selling smartwatch ad 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.479
 today therefore it is the biggest competitor 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.039
 who has to face a competitor's apple 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.900
 which however uses a philosophy 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.760
 completely different than that 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.349
 from other apple producers too 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.240
 so we'll see what the will be 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.710
 market response from here to some 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.300
 month 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370
 in short, because we know Apple Watch 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.700
 will be released in April with regard to 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.780
 next beta of ios and also bsx as it is 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.970
 been done already 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.860
 apple would plan to open the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.660
 beta testing to all users therefore 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.150
 for the first time without a developer ca 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.760
 users can try out regularly 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.010
 the next release of ios primo that 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.650
 these are public for example ios 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.270
 8.3 should already be open to all a 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.160
 mid-March therefore really between 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.410
 very little and the same speech should 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.630
 happen for the far more interesting ios 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.220
 9 which as we know will be presented 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.810
 released in beta in June and then 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.290
 can be tried until September 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.210
 October 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.770
 not only from developers but from everyone 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.300
 users a grand opening that maybe 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.560
 will not do that well know die welt that in 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.630
 this way making him try more 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.100
 people and then you can receive much more 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.750
 feedback and work on correcting 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.370
 those bugs that will be reported either 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.780
 by users this time both from 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.970
 developers while regarding 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.870
 apple half-public versions already 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.850
 ios 8.3 beta 2 released is the second 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.650
 half of the next next update 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.480
 next system update that 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.460
 for the moment it does not include the big ones 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.080
 news if not new ones and wife 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.900
 now multiethnic then all 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.430
 wives have more smilies with them with 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.620
 complexion of different colors 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.810
 the wives of 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.360
 apple watch is also that of iphone e 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.500
 mac are said to be updated then 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.990
 some bugs are also fixed 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.420
 related to wireless car play added on 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.280
 lte support on verizon e networks 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.530
 slight performance improvements 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.030
 iphone 4s and iphone 5 for the rest there 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.160
 they are big news as usual 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.480
 in short, they are minor updates 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.490
 we will see second apple watch maybe 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.320
 the latest will come some other news 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.750
 two news items today concern both 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.210
 whatsapp the first is that whatsapp has 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.680
 officially enabled calls on 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.140
 android which means users 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.780
 android can already experiment now 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.550
 free voip calls on whatsapp 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.500
 however it seems that not all users 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.780
 android can do that right now because 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.820
 maybe roll out is progressing 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.410
 progressive as usual in these 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.970
 cases while the second news that 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.460
 concerns only in this case the 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.560
 IOS users who were late are concerned 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.620
 a guide we published on how 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.900
 activate the whatsapp function now 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.510
 web even for iphone I tell you right away is 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.830
 a 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.020
 it is necessary that silvia asks why 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.340
 requires a tweak to activate it but one 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.660
 once done this and once done the 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.180
 jailbreak once installed this 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.530
 tweak which is called whatsapp is neither blair 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.360
 you can use whatsapp web 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.830
 exactly like you do with android with 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.740
 windows mode then connecting to 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.260
 web page by scanning the code qr e 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.870
 then practically having all your 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.000
 real whatsapp chats for iphone on
