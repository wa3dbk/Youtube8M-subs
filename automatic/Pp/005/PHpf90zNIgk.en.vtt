00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.160
 It is the most expensive signing in history 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:11.280
 of soccer when he 's here in mate 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.200
 see how guys are here girls their 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 June fair then let's talk 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 which have been the most expensive girls in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.600
 the history of football must be taken in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 account that these prices are a thousand pounds 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 then one free 126 euros and 126 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 euros 3 163 dollars number 10 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.619
 david luiz the chelsea and team that what 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 sold to paris saint germain for 50 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 millions of pounds in the I believe that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.250
 everybody loves david luiz cent of the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.379
 clown of the team and yes yes but nine 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 like to go against him and not in the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.460
 position we want the Colombian falcao 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 when he left Atletico Madrid to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 go to Madrid's athletic mona 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 affected 51 million books before 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.579
 our mind now at the end it was to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 loan to manchester united and I think 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 that we are going to wait another year to be able 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.399
 see it in the champions league in eighth 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.240
 place we have the Uruguayan Edison Cavani 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.520
 the napoli challenge a figure of 55 million 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.870
 from Paris Saint Germain alone in these 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.910
 three tablespoons we can see if the country 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.800
 in yemen he has a lot of money and he likes it 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.020
 spend the people we have place we have to 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.360
 a Brazilian who is well known for being 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 Christian are talking about cocoa 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.010
 can the milan real madrid the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.020
 meringues paid 56 million ibex 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.300
 in sixth place we are talking about di 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 Maria the player who just signed with 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.580
 the manchester united the manchester and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.200
 nobody buys the real Madrid for 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.330
 59.7 million pounds and in my opinion 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.470
 getting a bargain because I said maria 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.080
 it is another level 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.420
 I think the mother could but much more in 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 this position we have an acrobat who 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.350
 it's called the zlatan ibrahimóvic the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.930
 barcelona bought it from the Italians 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 of inter de milán by 60 million 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.119
 pounds and in the end they sold it for a lot 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 I think it was for 20 million we can see 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.330
 that there is a big difference in fourth 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.400
 instead we are talking about another 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.950
 Colombian James Rodriguez the Great 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.200
 madrid bought it for 63 million 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.670
 pounds to the monaco of france we can 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.410
 say that Colombians are very expensive 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.210
 in current football in the next 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.979
 position we have a uruguay I think that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.420
 he is known for being a cannibal 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.090
 We are talking about Luis Suarez 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.340
 the barcelona paid 35 million pounds 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.800
 the liverpool of england that is the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.170
 school took that money to buy 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 great players like balotelli the wool 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.880
 among others the second place is one of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.130
 the best players of our 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.860
 Christian times ronaldo the Real Madrid 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.690
 paid 80 million pounds to Manchester 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 united if you realize in 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 Manchester and Real Madrid have 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 many negotiations between them the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 first place is a player who 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.230
 help real madrid to get the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.019
 'tenth' gareth bale the real madrid 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.510
 paid the tottenham of england 105 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.250
 points 3 million pounds the boys 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.230
