00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.010 
the ball I saw the need to look at
but<00:04:43.340> giggle<00:04:44.150> that<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.509> fact<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:44.900> was

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
but giggle that the fact that it was

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.600 
but giggle that the fact that it was
touched<00:04:45.259> by<00:04:45.470> Wakefield<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:46.130> doesn't<00:04:46.430> matter

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
touched by Wakefield that doesn't matter

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.300 
touched by Wakefield that doesn't matter
Stuart<00:04:47.150> now<00:04:47.500> he<00:04:48.500> still<00:04:48.740> got<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.009> because<00:04:49.130> it

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
Stuart now he still got you because it

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.309 
Stuart now he still got you because it
within<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> ten<00:04:49.849> when<00:04:50.060> he's<00:04:50.180> touched<00:04:50.449> it<00:04:50.660> if

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
within the ten when he's touched it if

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.529 
within the ten when he's touched it if
it'll<00:04:51.860> count<00:04:52.160> as<00:04:52.340> being<00:04:52.370> offside<00:04:52.940> okay<00:04:53.330> so

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
it'll count as being offside okay so

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.120 
it'll count as being offside okay so
he's<00:04:53.780> definitely<00:04:53.960> in<00:04:54.289> front<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.740> when<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:58.009> gets

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
he's definitely in front so when it gets

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.580 
he's definitely in front so when it gets
to<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:59.300> point<00:04:59.569> where<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.900> balls<00:05:00.139> coming

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
to the the point where the balls coming

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.499 
to the the point where the balls coming
down<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.919> man<00:05:01.069> waiting<00:05:01.520> for<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.789> ball<00:05:04.509> it's

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
down the man waiting for the ball it's

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.839 
down the man waiting for the ball it's
that<00:05:05.720> point<00:05:05.960> there<00:05:06.259> that<00:05:06.289> he<00:05:07.099> is<00:05:07.430> he<00:05:07.580> within

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
that point there that he is he within

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.670 
that point there that he is he within
the<00:05:07.970> ten<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.660> he<00:05:08.780> probably<00:05:08.990> is<00:05:09.259> within<00:05:09.470> the

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
the ten and he probably is within the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.980 
the ten and he probably is within the
ten<00:05:09.889> there<00:05:10.130> so<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.340> think<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.729> mayor<00:05:10.880> well<00:05:11.090> look

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
ten there so I think the mayor well look

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.800 
ten there so I think the mayor well look
at<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.229> as<00:05:12.349> being<00:05:12.380> offside

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.120 

well<00:05:16.320> they<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.590> they<00:05:16.710> look<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:16.860> they've

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
well they and they look like they've

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.650 
well they and they look like they've
gotten<00:05:17.340> ahead<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.700> digital<00:05:18.180> Whelan's

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
gotten ahead of that digital Whelan's

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.080 
gotten ahead of that digital Whelan's
then<00:05:18.870> knock<00:05:19.350> it<00:05:19.500> forward<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:20.130> think<00:05:20.670> on<00:05:20.940> that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
then knock it forward I think on that

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.779 
then knock it forward I think on that
shot<00:05:21.360> it's<00:05:21.570> it's<00:05:22.230> Craig<00:05:22.530> all<00:05:22.710> isn't<00:05:22.980> it
