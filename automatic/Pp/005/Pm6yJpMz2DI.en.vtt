00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
Christianity and that's if one is to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.980 
Christianity and that's if one is to
prove<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.700> invalidity<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.179> then<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.539> valid

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
prove the invalidity of it then it valid

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.190 
prove the invalidity of it then it valid
themself<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:43.479> way

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.130 

so<00:01:46.890> they're<00:01:47.039> just<00:01:47.219> great<00:01:47.759> fear<00:01:50.329> I'm<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.930> on

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so they're just great fear I'm on I'm on

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.279 
so they're just great fear I'm on I'm on
say<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.979> fear<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:54.649> think<00:01:55.649> by<00:01:57.049> classified<00:01:58.049> as

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
say it's fear I think by classified as

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:07.690 
say it's fear I think by classified as
fear<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:59.610> does<00:01:59.969> them<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:01.679> best<00:02:01.920> justice<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.110> I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.540 

think<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:08.849> way<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> approach<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
think that's way to approach it in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.089 
think that's way to approach it in
giving<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:12.330> condition<00:02:13.019> love<00:02:13.200> because<00:02:13.739> if<00:02:13.950> it

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
giving a condition love because if it

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:23.509 
giving a condition love because if it
isn't<00:02:14.400> fear<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.310> could

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
isn't fear then what is it on all could

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.759 
isn't fear then what is it on all could
be<00:02:23.640> ignorant<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.630> ignorance<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.260> not

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
be ignorant you know ignorance is not

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.120 
be ignorant you know ignorance is not
knowing<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:27.019> if<00:02:28.019> one<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.709> reads<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
knowing but if if one just reads the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.210 
knowing but if if one just reads the
Bible<00:02:29.660> themselves<00:02:30.660> then<00:02:30.870> they<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.530> you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
