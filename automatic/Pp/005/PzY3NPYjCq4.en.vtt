the<00:00:58.620> Bible<00:00:58.940> answers<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.270> questions

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
the Bible answers these questions

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.380 
the Bible answers these questions
clearly<00:01:01.399> first<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> Bible<00:01:02.910> says<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.300> don't

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
clearly first the Bible says we don't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.230 
clearly first the Bible says we don't
have<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.809> happy<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.650> death<00:01:05.090> we<00:01:06.090> don't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
have to be happy about death we don't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.679 
have to be happy about death we don't
have<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.470> God<00:01:07.740> wanted

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
have to say this is what God wanted

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
have to say this is what God wanted
rather<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.900> Bible<00:01:10.170> says<00:01:10.350> death<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.310> enemy

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
rather the Bible says death is an enemy

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.020 
rather the Bible says death is an enemy
both<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.570> God<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.380> us<00:01:13.610> for<00:01:14.610> example<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
both of God and of us for example the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
both of God and of us for example the
Apostle<00:01:15.450> Paul<00:01:15.630> writes<00:01:16.009> for<00:01:17.009> he<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.610> Christ

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
Apostle Paul writes for he that's Christ

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.450 
Apostle Paul writes for he that's Christ
must<00:01:18.930> reign<00:01:19.259> until<00:01:19.290> he<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:19.860> put<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.189> his

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
must reign until he has put all his

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.289 
must reign until he has put all his
enemies<00:01:21.200> under<00:01:22.200> his<00:01:22.229> feet<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.580> last<00:01:23.850> enemy

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
enemies under his feet the last enemy

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.100 
enemies under his feet the last enemy
that<00:01:24.509> will<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.869> abolished<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.189> death

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
that will be abolished is what is death

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
that will be abolished is what is death
that's<00:01:28.110> comforting<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> me<00:01:28.950> God<00:01:29.939> doesn't<00:01:30.270> like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that's comforting to me God doesn't like

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.109 
that's comforting to me God doesn't like
death<00:01:30.659> any<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.140> than<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.740> he<00:01:32.460> calls<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.970> an

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
death any more than we do he calls it an

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.800 
death any more than we do he calls it an
enemy<00:01:33.799> why<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.280> enemy<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.610> God<00:01:35.810> it's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
enemy why is that the enemy of God it's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.890 
enemy why is that the enemy of God it's
because<00:01:37.170> death<00:01:37.590> destroys<00:01:38.310> life<00:01:38.700> whereas<00:01:39.659> God
