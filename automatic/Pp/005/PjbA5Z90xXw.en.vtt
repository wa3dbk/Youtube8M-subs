all<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.430> fun<00:01:44.610> stuff<00:01:44.640> my<00:01:45.240> first<00:01:45.479> piece<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
all that fun stuff my first piece of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.160 
all that fun stuff my first piece of
gear<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> tack<00:01:47.070> amine<00:01:47.369> acoustic<00:01:48.079> it's<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
gear was a tack amine acoustic it's a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.789 
gear was a tack amine acoustic it's a
big<00:01:49.439> old<00:01:49.680> dreadnought<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.960> can't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
big old dreadnought I was like I can't

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
big old dreadnought I was like I can't
even<00:01:52.890> remember<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.340> age<00:01:53.810> I'm<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:55.320> gonna<00:01:55.470> do

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
even remember what age I'm not gonna do

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.679 
even remember what age I'm not gonna do
the<00:01:55.649> math<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> guess<00:01:56.219> 14<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.210> 15<00:01:57.479> years<00:01:57.509> ago

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the math but I guess 14 or 15 years ago

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
the math but I guess 14 or 15 years ago
and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.590> massive<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.159> couldn't<00:01:59.399> even<00:01:59.460> get

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and it was massive I couldn't even get

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
it is that you have to say with

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.180 
it is that you have to say with
conviction

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
conviction

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.860 
conviction
you<00:02:49.580> know<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:49.880> telling<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.270> story<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you know if I'm telling you a story and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.320 
you know if I'm telling you a story and
I<00:02:51.740> forget<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> punchline<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.090> gonna<00:02:53.180> be

I forget the punchline it's not gonna be
very<00:02:53.360> funny<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.280> think<00:02:55.610> that's<00:02:55.940> probably

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
very funny so I think that's probably

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.580 
very funny so I think that's probably
one<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.510> most<00:02:56.600> important<00:02:57.050> things<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.410> just

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
one of the most important things is just

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.810 
one of the most important things is just
remember<00:02:57.920> what<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.640> you're<00:02:58.730> trying

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
remember what it is that you're trying

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:08.080 
remember what it is that you're trying
to<00:02:58.940> convey

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.150
