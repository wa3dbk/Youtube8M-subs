00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.750
 good morning good afternoon good night 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.200
 I'm on the fifth try for 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 cover the tutorial 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.400
 the translator decided not to do are line 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.120
 let's go green 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the description is the link of this 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.950
 program of another version 1.11 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.079
 As you can see I'm in the folder 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.059
 meo then the eyes sabin of minus three 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.710
 dishes and this is going to open that 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.440
 window 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.300
 we explain a patch to be able 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.079
 translate what can you find in google 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.060
 look for patch laws from said master 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.570
 online with him 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.080
 and me 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.840
 in the file that I upload 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.550
 pay attention to the date today is 4 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 June 2014 and I have 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 in three more recent parts that have 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.090
 stepped out 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.790
 2 in English and one in Spanish 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.980
 that this one I found out there I hope they 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.240
 can they serve some of those now what 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.240
 is what we are going to do to throw it out 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.250
 and the patch where they found it 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.250
 in this case I have the wine folder 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.420
 in this patch no 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.420
 this is spanish 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.230
 we give it where it says bin find 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.690
 and here where bin file says 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.310
 and that little window is going to appear very 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.740
 all good all good all good 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.700
 typical changing the trash that happens 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.460
 just when I'm recording 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.460
 and this 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.530
 two minutes nothing else we have to open 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.810
 our said online master if this one 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.650
 did some update from the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.870
 last time they left 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.599
 this will reappear everything in 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.020
 Korean then first and here I already 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:35.270
 says download the updates 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.690
 let it update let it continue 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.100
 good 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.040
 let it stop all the information and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.140
 after that, you return it to 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.970
 pat and you can play now that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.100
 I think I can not record the video 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.250
 online masters in this mode for 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.710
 show them how it is in the translation 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.470
 but what I put on this one 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.660
 has varied trans of much of the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.050
 Spanish what is the problem with these 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.210
 patches this one does not translate them as such the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.030
 description of the missions that you are going 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.240
 talking about a lemon in the story 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.310
 from our side and such installed side 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.740
 then you have to go to kill so 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.960
 minimum suspicious of high part that does not 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.460
 going to appear is going to continue in Korean that 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.090
 is what if you are not translating the 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.160
 names the achievements are on the right side 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.600
 you see there the missions of bothering him 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.900
 what do you have to do for 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.780
 example if you saw this they will defeat 5 Aug 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.370
 mounts good and defeats like why 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.750
 because it is already translated and it is not so 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.660
 particular letter in Korean of which already 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.390
 we said you have to kill in short 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.120
 I present you saving a lot this has 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.130
 produced but also some missions 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.140
 of the newest ones are not going to come 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.440
 translated why because in the patches 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.570
 they are not so updated the latter 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.960
 patch which is in Spanish that's why it's 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.960
 that I am occupying it comes from as 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.910
 one or two months I never believe what 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:05.790
 it was even since February that patch 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.790
 and those in English have this 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.290
 I do not know do not know but no longer has time 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.920
 the most recent updates come 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.209
 that's why you should look 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.190
 in google if there is a relative 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:22.400
 I 'm saving you the work of 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.400
 patches because there is no other 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.190
 google put patch 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.190
 typical typical cloud lime patch 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.009
 in Spanish 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.939
 what we have 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.939
 to translate 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.039
 and typical that asks me to register 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.389
 according to what we would already have one of the 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.620
 matches in fact here leave us forums 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.430
 I think there are some of the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.430
 last matches 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.979
 the point that you have to 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.620
 look for the patches on your own to 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.620
 see but if not 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.520
 I do not think that's the whole tutorial is 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.970
 basically that if they have any doubt 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.100
 as 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.080
 the patch is not going to translate everything 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.630
 more some accounts things thank you how many 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.960
 things I hope will help them and it would be 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.960
 to play 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.940
 good the global the one that is in English I 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.670
 I think they lead to a good 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.880
 advantage that missions go where 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.700
 they have to go but 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.290
 if not the same can go a lot of help me 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.990
 I say goodbye to all of you and I hope to see you 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.640
 more videos 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.220
 certainly thanks to those who are 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.440
 leaving like all the videos in the 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.110
 who share those who do not share 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.750
 also but another read to those who 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.340
 they shoot the channel everywhere and on 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.570
 everything to those who are subscribing because 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.570
 there are already 250
