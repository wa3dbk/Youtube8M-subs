00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
can see this is the result of the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.160 
can see this is the result of the
twisting<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.809> took<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:38.180> 45<00:00:39.180> minutes<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
twisting it took about 45 minutes or so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
twisting it took about 45 minutes or so
and<00:00:42.680> yeah<00:00:43.680> two<00:00:44.670> melons<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> 45<00:00:46.559> minutes<00:00:47.039> to

mirrors<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.410> jail<00:00:50.030> which<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
mirrors and a lot of jail which is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
mirrors and a lot of jail which is
probably<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> good<00:00:51.960> thing<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
probably not a good thing this is the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
probably not a good thing this is the
result<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.270> feel<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:56.180> wear<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
result and I feel very well like wear it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.889 
result and I feel very well like wear it
out<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.699> maybe<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.969> make<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> little

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
out like this maybe like make a little

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
out like this maybe like make a little
bouffant<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> front<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.949> put<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> little

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
bouffant in the front and put a little

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
bouffant in the front and put a little

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
bit of jail on it and it will probably

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.850 
bit of jail on it and it will probably
curl<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.820> that's<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> style<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.560> go
