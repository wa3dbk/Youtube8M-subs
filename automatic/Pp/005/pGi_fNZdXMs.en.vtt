 rival rinaldi a bill too 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.109

 actually you would have world championship 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.319
 be warned as strikingly little 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.299
 spain apply for this 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.890
 have registered but for the time being 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.780
 nobody paid attention to that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.519
 Organizers seem to have enduro 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.769

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.829
 difficult passages still come extremely 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.360
 short stages times 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.980

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.489
 with broken bones in the hospital again 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.590
