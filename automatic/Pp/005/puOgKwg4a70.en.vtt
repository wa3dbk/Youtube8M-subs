it into pieces and how you do this part

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.830 
it into pieces and how you do this part
is<00:02:04.159> completely<00:02:04.490> up<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.850> as<00:02:05.000> well<00:02:05.180> what<00:02:05.810> I

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
did is I divided it 5 rows by 5 columns

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.940 
did is I divided it 5 rows by 5 columns
ending<00:02:11.269> up<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.480> 25<00:02:11.959> pieces<00:02:12.380> approximately

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
ending up with 25 pieces approximately

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.540 
ending up with 25 pieces approximately
and<00:02:14.079> then<00:02:15.079> I<00:02:15.110> cut<00:02:15.470> each<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.950> pieces<00:02:16.190> in

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and then I cut each of the pieces in

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.600 
and then I cut each of the pieces in
half<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.480> make<00:02:17.660> little<00:02:18.379> triangle<00:02:19.010> shapes

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
half to make little triangle shapes

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.260 
half to make little triangle shapes

and if you line them up properly you
should<00:02:23.480> be<00:02:23.600> able<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:24.020> maybe<00:02:24.340> several<00:02:25.340> at

at room temperature they get a little

at room temperature they get a little
bit<00:03:07.340> soft<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.790> melty<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.020> when<00:03:09.200> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
bit soft and melty so that when you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.020 
bit soft and melty so that when you

that's<00:03:13.340> why<00:03:13.580> it's<00:03:13.700> better<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.000> keep<00:03:14.150> them<00:03:14.330> very

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
that's why it's better to keep them very

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.030 
that's why it's better to keep them very
small<00:03:14.720> like<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.650> people<00:03:15.890> can

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
small like that so that people can

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.650 
small like that so that people can
unwrap<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:17.060> pop<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.390> right<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.600> the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
unwrap it and just pop it right in the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.199 
unwrap it and just pop it right in the
mouth<00:03:17.780> for<00:03:18.470> one<00:03:18.650> bite<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.100> then<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.940> would

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
mouth for one bite and then that would

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.930 
mouth for one bite and then that would
be<00:03:20.330> perfect<00:03:21.100> now<00:03:22.100> if<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.280> decide<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.790> give

be perfect now if you decide to give
these<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> try<00:03:23.239> I'm<00:03:23.630> going<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.840> offer<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.410> couple

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.900 
of suggestions first of all I think you
could<00:03:27.830> reduce<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.340> amount<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.580> butter<00:03:28.760> in

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
could reduce the amount of butter in

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.210 
could reduce the amount of butter in
this<00:03:29.030> from<00:03:29.390> 3/4<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.019> cup<00:03:30.049> down<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.680> 1/2<00:03:30.980> cup

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
this from 3/4 of a cup down to 1/2 cup

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.340 
this from 3/4 of a cup down to 1/2 cup
quite<00:03:31.519> easily<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.840> other<00:03:32.989> thing<00:03:33.230> I'm

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.090 
going to mention is I think you should
use<00:03:34.940> unsalted<00:03:35.390> butter<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.930> use<00:03:36.680> salted<00:03:37.040> butter

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the butter was quite prominent in the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.050 
the butter was quite prominent in the
final<00:03:42.200> result<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:43.040> was<00:03:43.220> still<00:03:43.430> good<00:03:43.640> because

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
final result it was still good because

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.000 
final result it was still good because
sweet<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.660> salty<00:03:44.959> go<00:03:45.110> quite<00:03:45.380> nicely<00:03:45.590> together

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
sweet and salty go quite nicely together

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.820 
sweet and salty go quite nicely together
and<00:03:46.340> even<00:03:46.519> in<00:03:46.850> desserts<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.320> found<00:03:48.650> a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
and even in desserts but I found a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.860 
and even in desserts but I found a
little<00:03:49.190> bit<00:03:49.459> too<00:03:49.640> much<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:49.850> use<00:03:50.480> unsalted

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
little bit too much so use unsalted

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.259 
little bit too much so use unsalted
butter<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.440> if<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.250> want<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.549> give<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.000> try

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
butter and if you want to give it a try

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.750 
butter and if you want to give it a try
by<00:03:53.680> reducing<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.860> amount<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.070> butter<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.310> think

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
by reducing the amount of butter I think

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.210 
by reducing the amount of butter I think
that<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.690> could<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.080> as<00:03:57.290> well<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:57.980> if<00:03:58.100> you

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
that you could do that as well so if you

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.039 
that you could do that as well so if you
do<00:03:58.400> give<00:03:58.610> these<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.790> try<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.150> try<00:03:59.840> any

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
do give these a try and try any

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.170 
do give these a try and try any
alterations<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.830> recipe<00:04:01.250> or<00:04:01.459> if<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.060> use

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
alterations to the recipe or if you use

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.430 
alterations to the recipe or if you use
a<00:04:02.209> different<00:04:02.360> kind<00:04:02.630> of<00:04:02.690> cookie<00:04:02.989> I'd<00:04:03.110> love<00:04:03.290> to
