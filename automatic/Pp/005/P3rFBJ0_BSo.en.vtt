00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 she gives a hint now about cadence at 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.710
 monica is a monad cadence 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.010
 characterized by the functional combination 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.740
 chords and needs at least two 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.369
 chords with different functions by 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.890
 example 251 is a cadence called 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.310
 perfect lack because because she 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.320
 Here you can find all possible functions 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 we have here rise in the dominant unit 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 tonic of san antonio 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 that is, in the case of the sun the two defendants only 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.239
 one is also from 11 and this one cadence 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.399
 perfect appearance 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.940
 we also have the imperfect cadence 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.930
 cool head and cadence and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 businesswoman 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.270
 what importance do we know and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.730
 we know about the needs through 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.840
 a cadence we can set the tone 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.270
 of a scale the tone of a rock music 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.840
 for example a chord progression 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.100
 you do not necessarily have to have me 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.780
 according to different functions by 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.780
 example I can play here in its greatest 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.100
 playing now that everyone has a function 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.280
 architectural and none define 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.899
 exactly which car because 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.939
 they belong to several other scales 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:44.159
 but if I play here a minor in a back already 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.159
 killed the charade is not or for example 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.200
 this lack here already told me that this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.369
 chord sequence or progression 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.000
 it's in the biggest sun 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.819
 now an example of imperfect coherence 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.910
 want it perfect would you have it 15 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 only one of the chords or both 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:21.209
 universal chords for example that one is 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.730
 low on Tuesday to solve sun would be 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.040
 an imperfect belief then the head 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.269
 perfect is the result of the ruling with 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.930
 the tonic with a man in the chords 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.079
 inverted 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.470
 another example would be easy or medium 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.829
 minute here solving only I do neither 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.480
 weakens here the cadence by 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.790
 this would be a perfect grace. 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:54.510
 combination of the northern subprime and 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.739
 tonic ie could be as is very 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.139
 you see a song being played. 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.139
 finished with a cool head would be 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.200
 it's the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 right in the case of sun function up 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.439
 novelty is for the 4th grade that 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.409
 secondary education, which is lower because 636 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.620
 when the rest is done in the 5th 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:28.459
 degree ie I could have one here 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.650
 smaller and a rap and did not resolve was 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:50.659
 here in the river is dominant then 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:54.230
 my head 6 lack of affection 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.790
 or interrupted interrupted receptive 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.069
 has this name because it apparently 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.889
 He is preparing for such a determined 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.139
 degree but solves any other degree 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:09.469
 any degree for example could do 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:14.900
 with 125 for the sun and solve at a lower 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:26.270
 disappoints executive snow or deceit 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:29.599
 also called have several others 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.659
 examples I'm just trying to explain the 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:35.870
 which are each and then have a 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:39.320
 what motlanthe lack would be is a 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.560
 which prepares a degree of a 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:47.990
 another scale but lacked a sun 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.060
 appears this sequence that would be a 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.560
 why motlanthe is doing 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.960
 here a modulation for another gift another 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.289
 field to monica any dominant color 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.020
 that prepares for a new hue 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:07.180
 we can say that it is a 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.539
 these examples are small examples of 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.909
 which is more there are several other 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.029
 situations that define these 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:19.729
 I just small examples is to 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.460
 facilitate understanding ok 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.110
 I suggest 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.630
 practice studio more expensive subject than 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.830
 I 'm going to quote here what I'm going 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.590
 approaching I give here an idea and 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.570
 trying to pass as it works but who 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.850
 will develop that will study even if 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.160
 deepen the matter is that you are 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.190
 interested in improving their 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.710
 your harmonies 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.130
 scratch your compositions 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.830
 okay, remembering that this is valid for 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.900
 any inter sm style touches hawks and 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:59.360
 blues funk 10 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.050
 these concepts are usable and are 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.690
 used in all styles because 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:11.060
 logical that each one has is their language 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.900
 more is theory and worth for all and today 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.960
 in day 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.430
 pop music rock music in tha every time 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.130
 more sophisticated 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:23.180
 so if you want to be a good musician and 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.760
 is up to date you have to understand these 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.650
 things are basic even very mazzuco by 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.140
 on account of what I went through until it is well 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.620
 basic and as I went to record the 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:37.070
 videos I'll try to go deeper and 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.760
 dealing with more complex issues 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.290
 Okay, I hope it's being useful and that 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.110
 I'm being clear 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.840
 the idea is to deal with issues with a 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.540
 least possible coherence, ie 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.770
 to deal with matters and not be so 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.820
 in the subject for the other 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.310
 At this moment we are talking about 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.210
 functional harmony by studying some 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.830
 tips 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.310
 but as I already said before I suggest that 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.169
 you delve into the issues, okay, I 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.419
 I count on your opinion to know if 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.450
 is not useful if you have not 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:10.910
 doubt please leave your question ok
