00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
well I'm putting on a new chain and it's

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.059 
well I'm putting on a new chain and it's
too<00:00:06.569> long<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.049> want<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.350> cut<00:00:07.560> cut<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> couple

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
too long I want to cut cut a couple

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.129 
too long I want to cut cut a couple
links<00:00:08.550> off<00:00:09.019> now<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> could<00:00:13.190> take<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.370> off<00:00:15.139> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
links off now I could take it off the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.500 
links off now I could take it off the
chain<00:00:16.470> wheel<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.160> take<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> rear<00:00:18.000> wheel<00:00:18.180> off

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
chain wheel I take the rear wheel off

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.279 
chain wheel I take the rear wheel off
and<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:19.590> room<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> looser<00:00:20.520> chain

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
and have more room have a looser chain

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.240 
and have more room have a looser chain
but<00:00:23.240> because<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.050> easier<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:26.039> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
but because I it's just easier to do it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.929 
but because I it's just easier to do it
and<00:00:26.400> cleaner<00:00:27.560> like<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.769> use<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.250> chain

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and cleaner like just use this chain

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.359 
and cleaner like just use this chain
hook<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.539> kind<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> made<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.130> coma

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
hook and I kind of made up out of a coma

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.450 
hook and I kind of made up out of a coma
hanger<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> hooked<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.469> chain<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.130> like

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
hanger so I hooked my chain on it like

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.310 
hanger so I hooked my chain on it like
this<00:00:36.440> make<00:00:37.440> sure<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.920> enough<00:00:38.190> slack<00:00:39.320> so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this make sure I have enough slack so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400 
this make sure I have enough slack so
that<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.829> could<00:00:41.700> take<00:00:41.879> these<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.809> links<00:00:43.230> off

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that I could take these two links off

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
that I could take these two links off
here<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.980> put<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> back<00:00:44.640> together<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:47.510> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
here and put it back together and it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.090 
here and put it back together and it
should<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.649> hitting<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.190> wheel<00:00:50.460> any<00:00:50.820> longer

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
should be hitting this wheel any longer

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:01.029 
should be hitting this wheel any longer
because<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.460> too<00:00:53.760> long<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.570> so

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.600 

what<00:01:02.039> I'll<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:03.650> is<00:01:04.650> take<00:01:04.710> me<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> couple<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
what I'll do is take me a couple of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:59.270 
what I'll do is take me a couple of
weeks<00:01:05.850> off

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:15.239 

save<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.760> education<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.300> need<00:02:01.510> it

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:15.249 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:22.030 

having<00:02:16.249> the<00:02:19.959> happy<00:02:20.959> no<00:02:21.139> pressure<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.769> here

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
having the happy no pressure on here

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.080 
having the happy no pressure on here
makes<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> lot<00:02:22.579> easier<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.760> don't<00:02:25.939> have

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
makes it a lot easier and I don't have

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.599 
makes it a lot easier and I don't have
to<00:02:26.299> take<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.439> off<00:02:27.650> or<00:02:27.859> put<00:02:27.889> it<00:02:28.099> back<00:02:28.249> on<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
to take it off or put it back on the

to take it off or put it back on the
chain<00:02:28.879> well<00:02:29.150> especially<00:02:29.599> if<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.049> chain<00:02:30.349> was

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
chain well especially if the chain was

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.619 
chain well especially if the chain was

bit<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.439> pressure<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:56.129> but<00:03:56.340> that's<00:03:57.239> how

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
bit of pressure on it but that's how

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.890 
bit of pressure on it but that's how
most<00:03:57.720> people<00:03:57.840> do<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.639> you<00:03:59.639> put<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.239> back<00:04:00.359> on<00:04:00.419> not

most people do it you put it back on not
a<00:04:00.930> big<00:04:01.139> deal<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.579> change<00:04:02.909> real<00:04:03.299> dirty

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
a big deal but it to change real dirty

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.599

and greasy and you just want to take a
link<00:04:05.909> or<00:04:06.060> add<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> link<00:04:06.480> use<00:04:07.469> your<00:04:07.620> chain<00:04:07.829> hook

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
link or add a link use your chain hook

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.030 
link or add a link use your chain hook
it<00:04:08.430> makes<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.909> a<00:04:08.969> lot<00:04:09.090> easier<00:04:12.799> except<00:04:13.799> for<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
it makes it a lot easier except for the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.459 
it makes it a lot easier except for the
know-it-alls
