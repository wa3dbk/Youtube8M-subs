00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.480
 so even people welcome to 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.420
 a new gameplay comments from me 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.460
 in a channel modern warfare 2 I have 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.100
 I thought you'll grab those times 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.119
 bread with bread 1 point the favorite 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.060
 great of our redhead he so me 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.099
 Today, I want to find out about the topic of games 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.109
 speak yes I do not know there was 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.479
 already determined many comments about 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.739
 the topic of games looking but I've got 

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.889
 Of course, a very own opinion 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.389
 on the subject and thought that me 

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:43.399
 bring that closer to you 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:45.589
 Of course I'm interested then 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.389
 of course, right at the beginning of times you are 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.479
 addicted to your own games you buy yourself 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:52.280
 every game that comes out just because you 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.260
 absolutely want to play something or 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.479
 would you consider yourself a game addict? 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.979
 describe 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.569
 and yes, I'm coming to you right now 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.469
 in my opinion and although I think so 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:05.030
 that I am very addicted to games, yes 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.310
 How should I describe it differently? 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.140
 Just like to play for my life 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.520
 Of course, earlier with playmobil was or 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.210
 I was with lego or women's bodies 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.670
 yes, that's just how it is to play 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.140
 if it is somewhere in the men's nature 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.969
 Now we will get new mobile phone 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.600
 also played on the phone that is 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.009
 Hold on, so I think so what 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.359
 My personal opinion is I think 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.219
 It starts with games in which one simply starts 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.939
 You will spend much more leisure time 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.869
 at the console or at the pc or on the mobile phone 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.939
 than that one with his friends 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.409
 now one or the other likes to spend 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.659
 say yes 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.890
 by having xbox games I have 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.380
 yes very much contact with others 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.359
 People, of course, realize that you can 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.429
 also maintains and cherishes these contacts and 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.319
 that it's the same with me 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.039
 I have many of my reallife buddies 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.139
 meanwhile over the internet 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.299
 met over xbox or else 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:02.719
 something is just in the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.850
 today but so I think you have to 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.109
 just such a certain function 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.579
 I always see it as two now 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.630
 I see it on one side 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.660
 from the gamer view 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.980
 because of course i can say i'm fine 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.440
 It's the same way I come from work 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.820
 home and wants to gamble immediately but I am 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.760
 not so i work in the sky 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.580
 I will and must necessarily gamble 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.840
 think you have to distinguish this addiction 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.230
 so I think there are people who 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.210
 are not about playing at school 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.980
 the rum must play all the time in the 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.870
 Internet are the must have everything 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.770
 control and just have to gamble 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.360
 they are extremely addictive, I think 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.180
 You can be addicted to alcohol 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.720
 Cigarettes can be addictive so after 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.730
 nicotine and just as I am of the opinion 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.670
 that you can also be addicted to games 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.670
 may or may not be addicted to games 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.370
 because I think you have to do it too 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.020
 be very honest because if we 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.040
 now considered then the other view 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.540
 I now have a view of the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.100
 gamers seen there I can, of course 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.990
 perfectly understand that one the whole 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.020
 but on the other side it has to gamble 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.470
 you can see the view of the parents 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.640
 so i do not have any kids i want 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.050
 of course children at some point 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.320
 but not so fast now 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.570
 Of course I do not have to say it is there 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.190
 a difficult topic because if mine 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.290
 son or my daughter sometime after 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.240
 home comes and nothing for the school 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.680
 do more and just play and only 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.350
 still zockt and then suddenly in itself 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.970
 on you go pays attention not only to be 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.140
 on the outside one does not wash anymore 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.420
 you do not shower anymore 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.750
 that's just the mark where I am then 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.640
 as a father or as a parent somehow 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.530
 would be funny and there 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.450
 I can also ban this somewhere 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.000
 it was like that when I still understand 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.950
 I used to live with my mom 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.180
 complete Internet ban he was allowed 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.800
 not at all we were on the internet 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.150
 well i was somebody i was after 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.270
 school every time outside and mine 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.970
 buddies playing football in real 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.230
 live but what I just stop then 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.060
 I realized sometime then it has me 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.000
 just moved in this direction new 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.530
 this gaming industry is gaming and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.280
 I find that very interesting because 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.959
 it is indeed an occupation whether one 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.490
 or others of the ggs maybe in the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.360
 football before a game stayed like 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.190
 Soccer 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.440
 the other one does just that that he does 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.030
 like to gamble and i do not want any 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.430
 one may also condemn the gamer 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.900
 scene like gamer industry not 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.980
 denounce that any louder 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.690
 asocial are 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.370
 most are all fat and unshaven 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.080
 and you can not say that ugly 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.760
 Of course there is this cliché but that 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.560
 cliché is the same with the emos 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.970
 is among the rockers in the hip hoppers 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.280
 there is also the hip hopper of the 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.150
 runs around with his fat pants 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.800
 let down 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.020
 but it can also be nice 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.610
 His name is not just because he is human 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.260
 this cliché fills in that he 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.470
 so an asshole or otherwise 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.200
 Something is but like me earlier 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.310
 said games addiction is a topic me 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.000
 I do not know why 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.710
 own nose 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.890
 would you say you are 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.210
 playful so i can only 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.240
 in front of the mirror then ask yourself 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.350
 say I believe that I am addicted to games 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.880
 but I'm a real help for that 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.020
 I do not want it at all, it's not 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.240
 so you have to stop that the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.250
 pull out negative pages what I 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.840
 said earlier that's up 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.270
 a side that if you from school 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.100
 comes home and gamble on're there you have to 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.990
 that's the way you see it when you have yours 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.210
 educational achievements thereby of course 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.650
 then let it be the flute 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.020
 shit because then you have the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.030
 impact of this gambling addiction though 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.490
 But you have a job and you do it 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.780
 all your work is perfect that's all 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.950
 all right now squats all day 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.540
 because he just keeps getting addicted 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.140
 since then I think so too 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.150
 in order 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.760
 I think that's okay too 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.260
 the cigarettes addict just stop 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.120
 his cigarettes are smoking that now 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.210
 its a pity that is now 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.860
 Let's put it there because it harms 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.870
 yes, only when he is home then 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.010
 because of it smokes it's just that's it 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.480
 Now we need a discussion 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.790
 not endless now but I think 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.280
 stop what you are out there you are you 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.780
 all not necessarily in the age where you 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.580
 maybe already have a job or otherwise 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.770
 something I think the most important thing 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.240
 gambling is not neglected yours 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.100
 important things such as the 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.250
 school like your parents like your friends 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.910
 because otherwise you will notice someday 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.260
 shit life is mine 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.030
 and I just have that 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.230
 achieved highscore in some game 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.810
 And it does not make sense either 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.460
 thing that's why the message wanted 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.500
 if you are addicted to gambling you go out 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.440
 Do something with your buddies 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.430
 with your parents yes I hope that 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.720
 again clearly fallen if it you 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.370
 please just let one 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.200
 comment and forget of course 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.220
 please do not rate otherwise see 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.220
 us next time differently
