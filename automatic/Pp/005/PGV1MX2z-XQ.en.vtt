00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.029
 [Music] 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.709
 hello my name is max explained 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.080
 guinea pigs louder we otherwise 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.119
 said satisfaction of ours 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.760
 Satisfaction has proven to be hardworking 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.270
 And our posture is complete 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.010
 relaxed 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.380
 You can even hear it when we are 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.750
 sleep and it sounds so enjoy 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.330
 will enjoy yourself like an ice cream kitchen 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.550
 and you can see it if we like that 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.969
 just enjoy caressing and listening 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.969
 This is how it is 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.960
 whoever disturbs that sounds like a deep one 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.420
 children with a constant sound and 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.649
 to the posture is relative 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.780
 relaxed and our head to the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.210
 troublemaker or the disturbing noise 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.309
 turned and that sounds like that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.350
 all still okay, that's one 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.879
 Slightly up and down, it can squeak 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.739
 and we do not do that in any way 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.080
 Visible contact is more at 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.909
 exploration as a signal that no danger 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.909
 threatens and that sounds like that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.479
 where is just that is a quiet beeping and 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.369
 mainly from Munich on foraging 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.439
 It can not be for scared to hear 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.439
 pitch and does that sound 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.149
 to whistle 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.340
 this is a loud clicking sounding 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.229
 whistling to hear from young animals though 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.210
 even our head is adult 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 Often the body is stretched upwards, however 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.280
 close to the ground and it sounds like that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.700
 try boys and whales and try 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.590
 is a repeated climb in the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 middle area being our body 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.390
 long the other will be the female with the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.270
 flying noises increase that 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.460
 rattle for a stroll and that sounds like that 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.830
 Drumming and advertising verbs is one thing 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.940
 continuous narrow middle area 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.410
 with us the hind legs alternately 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.160
 come on and that sounds like that and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.440
 throw 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.900
 At moderate is a soft clap 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.640
 similar jungtier loud to hear from us 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.680
 our body is not on the ground 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:28.780
 and assembled and that sounds like that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.750
 We give a loud to a battle 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.120
 whistle from us and we are usually on 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.170
 gege wall or on an erect 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.530
 supported by a cottage 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.270
 and the sounds so with we fall 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.010
 make a swelling and decaying 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.010
 critical especially when we arrive 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.690
 be touched behind 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:59.019
 we throw our rear part then too 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:03:01.000
 back and forth and that sounds like when 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.680
 we do not want to be raised 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:12.100
 a mixture of whistling and squealing 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:13.540
 hear from us and that will be so in 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.519
 our head and this is one 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
 repeated or longer lasting 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.590
 clear in the midrange the easy on 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.799
 and swells can be heard and that listens 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.560
 so nothing to our warning causes 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.540
 we have set our goals back and forth 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.280
 and this is beaten on each other 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.730
 entronten not noticed it comes to 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.100
 attack 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.320
 our body is on all fours 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.320
 counted on and that sounds like that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.169
 [Music] 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.280
 maybe a comment that yes 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.280
 still wanted to know
