00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:20.669 
ever like to see that the only negative
I<00:06:19.149> had<00:06:19.539> was<00:06:19.719> I<00:06:19.839> thought<00:06:20.169> I<00:06:20.229> power-play

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:20.679 
I had was I thought I power-play

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.799 
I had was I thought I power-play
obviously<00:06:21.129> wasn't<00:06:21.849> clicking<00:06:22.149> tonight<00:06:22.539> but

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:22.809 
obviously wasn't clicking tonight but

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.510 
obviously wasn't clicking tonight but
the<00:06:23.080> good<00:06:23.229> news<00:06:23.259> is<00:06:23.529> usually<00:06:23.889> when<00:06:24.039> we<00:06:24.159> we<00:06:24.429> have

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
the good news is usually when we we have

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.889 
the good news is usually when we we have
a<00:06:24.580> bad<00:06:24.789> night<00:06:24.939> of<00:06:25.059> our<00:06:25.300> play<00:06:25.479> we<00:06:25.599> come<00:06:25.779> back

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:25.899 
a bad night of our play we come back

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:28.079 
a bad night of our play we come back
storm<00:06:26.259> and<00:06:26.439> so<00:06:26.589> we<00:06:27.099> tend<00:06:27.610> to<00:06:27.639> do<00:06:27.789> that<00:06:27.909> all<00:06:28.059> year

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:28.089 
storm and so we tend to do that all year

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.239 
storm and so we tend to do that all year
so<00:06:28.479> take<00:06:29.199> a<00:06:29.229> lot<00:06:29.409> of<00:06:29.439> positives<00:06:29.979> all<00:06:30.039> night<00:06:30.189> I

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:30.249 
so take a lot of positives all night I

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:32.670 
so take a lot of positives all night I
thought<00:06:30.399> the<00:06:30.490> guys<00:06:30.610> battled<00:06:31.059> hard<00:06:31.559> you<00:06:32.559> know

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
thought the guys battled hard you know

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.379 
thought the guys battled hard you know
and<00:06:32.860> I<00:06:33.009> thought<00:06:33.189> we<00:06:33.309> we<00:06:33.879> pretty<00:06:34.270> much

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
and I thought we we pretty much

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.059 
and I thought we we pretty much
dominated<00:06:34.899> the<00:06:35.050> game<00:06:35.229> from<00:06:35.469> from<00:06:35.709> start<00:06:35.949> to

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
dominated the game from from start to

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.029 
dominated the game from from start to
finish<00:06:36.369> and<00:06:36.399> you<00:06:37.119> know<00:06:37.209> the<00:06:37.330> they<00:06:38.289> played<00:06:38.800> they

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
finish and you know the they played they

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.170 
finish and you know the they played they
played<00:06:39.249> with<00:06:39.339> a<00:06:39.399> bit<00:06:39.520> of<00:06:39.550> grit<00:06:39.729> tonight<00:06:39.969> and

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
played with a bit of grit tonight and

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.179 
played with a bit of grit tonight and
for<00:06:40.509> a<00:06:40.689> game<00:06:41.050> that<00:06:41.080> literally<00:06:41.740> didn't<00:06:42.039> mean<00:06:42.159> a

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
for a game that literally didn't mean a

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.589 
for a game that literally didn't mean a
whole<00:06:42.430> lot<00:06:42.459> I<00:06:42.819> thought<00:06:42.939> the<00:06:43.089> guys<00:06:43.240> came<00:06:43.479> out

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
whole lot I thought the guys came out

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.839 
whole lot I thought the guys came out
and<00:06:43.809> put<00:06:43.899> on<00:06:43.990> a<00:06:44.020> pretty<00:06:44.199> good<00:06:44.289> show<00:06:44.759> lots<00:06:45.759> of

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849 
and put on a pretty good show lots of

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.179 
and put on a pretty good show lots of
goings-on<00:06:46.349> during<00:06:47.349> each<00:06:47.649> period<00:06:47.949> especially

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
goings-on during each period especially

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:50.040 
goings-on during each period especially
at<00:06:48.520> the<00:06:48.580> end<00:06:48.610> of<00:06:48.789> the<00:06:48.879> game<00:06:48.909> but<00:06:49.449> was<00:06:49.930> your

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
at the end of the game but was your

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.089 
at the end of the game but was your
taken<00:06:50.409> on<00:06:50.499> all<00:06:50.649> the<00:06:50.769> things<00:06:50.919> that<00:06:50.979> was

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:51.099 
taken on all the things that was

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.369

happening on the Belfast been I was

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.079 
happening on the Belfast been I was

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
I mean it was a little ridiculous at the

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.419 
I mean it was a little ridiculous at the
start<00:06:55.330> I<00:06:55.449> mean<00:06:55.569> it<00:06:55.800> it<00:06:56.800> was<00:06:56.919> the<00:06:57.039> Adam<00:06:57.249> Keefe
