00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.790
 a hot summer day 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.469
 the snake was lying on the steps that led to the garden 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:16.160
 she was completely stretched and while she was tanning her skin she listened 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.869
 the chatter of flowers 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.060

 its shiny silver armor 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.670
 the trinitarian resigned her violet eye 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190
 and looked towards the rosebush 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.080

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.800
 they said that she 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.680
 that haughty alley the calendula contemptuously 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.990
 can afford to have the snake that was all to keep the 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.030
 annoying snails and slugs 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.330
 the technician 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.710
 the snake 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.560
 had fallen in love with the beautiful red rose for several days did not move away 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350
 to overcome 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.920
 as the sun's rays became more and more intense 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 they found it more difficult to move 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 the skins in turn 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.830
 they began to wilt and bow their heads and soon they were silent 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.890
 even that same 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 it happened with the chatty marigolds 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.560
 at night 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.689
 the snake 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.880
 crawled with Cádiz port 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.290
 up to a hole in the nearby wall and penetrates 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.070
 His skin was dry like a parchment 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.910
 Soon the gate opened 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.910
 his appearance of the house marela with a reload and wins 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.070
 the thousand notes and the trinitarias were born in the heads of the marigolds 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810
 he turned to the rose to refresh him 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.679
 and this 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.369
 He extended his petals to catch the dots press castelló better 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.230
 when the woman is erased thrown 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.289
 the Russian was still holding between her petals 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.649
 a little puddle of crystal clear water 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:13.640
 so 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.909
 and I love the snake gently 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.019
 that slid towards her on the slabs 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.540
 if you have the diplomat to lie 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.170
 and stood for a moment with his chin resting on the petals of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.299
 the roses 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.239
 from that day 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.069
 his love for the rose grew even more 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.289
 during the day 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.240
 the strategic and at night 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.009
 krasic in search of food 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.590
 He would lie next to her with his silver body wrapped around the staff 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.339
 the head supported that his sins 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:46.249
 one day 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.829
 towards sunset 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.080
 Quindío produce mind time 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.429
 and started to blow mcclintock together 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.759
 the snake 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:59.009
 and both a little approached as usual to visit their roses 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.519
 they had disappeared 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.479
 tabasco everywhere 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.299
 but could not find 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.679
 the fever 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.829
 whose dream the snake had interrupted said angry 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.229
 in the farm 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:18.819
 I suppose they will have led to a comfortable and warm room despite 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.309
 that have some flowers 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:22.509
 the next 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.159
 He waited for everything to be quiet in the house and with the lights 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.249
 off 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.340
 so 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.629
 he crawled on the steps 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.039
 He slipped under the table 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.949
 and throughout science 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.309
 until you reach the front door 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.819
 the delay of the laying 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.139
 there was a hole through which the serpent passed 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.329
 when entering a room 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.089
 his show pee between felt contacts of a rough rug 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.969
 on the table 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.889
 in a vase 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.529
 this good cause he smiled at the pj 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.150
 with the new structure 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 and dropped some petals on the public surface of the table 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.449
 I could count on chalks artist 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.479
 -exclaimed narros

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.749
 damiao 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.879
 It is so clear that in all my projects 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.090
 the snake 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.400
 He did what he could to comfort him 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.989
 and when dawn 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.930
 the rose begged him to leave 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.590
 the snake promised to visit it every night and disappeared below 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.430
 the door 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.499
 for three nights the snake went to visit the Russian

 concacaf quote 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.330
 she was crying 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.740
 and I lost some of his sins 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.749
 one morning the motto of the house took what was left of the rose 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.990
 and threw her a bank of mossy ground 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.990
 they wanted the end of the garden and a dark and mysterious August 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.190
 despite the dye slid down the wall 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.659
 the tennis player from Alicante 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.729
 and looked at the withered and wrinkled rose 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.059
 with a heart full of hurry 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:02.510
 at nightfall 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.870
 he escaped a hole in the musician and proceeded with the dead leaves and 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.830
 marchistas petals crimson and soften 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.180
 and fell into a deep sleep that was like death itself 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.099
 the holidays 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.779
 it had come to an end and very soon the rains and winter winds 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.169
 advantage and then the golden leaves of the trees 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.839
 the chatter of the flowers had ceased 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.479
 and to the songs of the birds the strange and penetrating scream of the 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.529
 the mythical informant a dense layer 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:38.849
 and earth 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.080
 I remove here is 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.240
 and in silence 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.379
 when spring rains arrive 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.339
 that not even in the snow the snake 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:51.049
 he stirred slightly in the musician's bench between the garden 

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:52.779
 time 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.740
 when the warm sun rang 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.360
 if the flowers started to dance in a hurry 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 final we left happy atmosphere of its burrow 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.779
 if he fell on the garden slabs 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.189
 and he devoted himself to listening in the route of the pigeons 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.610
 also the primulas what they talked about 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.039
 0 your heart 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.490
 I was still afflicted 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.789
 in the ignacio primary step to summer 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.869
 and the serpent returned next to praying the boldness covered with green leaves 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.440
 and in the branch where he had been athletic foxes 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.999
 a small coffee 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.229
 the snake looked at him 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.189
 loosen his voice low 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:33.289
 it is very different 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.460
 with the three points 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.770
 the snake beans 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.800
 together the days to visit the rose 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.699
 and I am warm and splendid tomorrow 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.819
 the cappuccino was activated 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.960
 and showed a red and velvety split 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.830
 the snake thought then that after the long winter months 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.969
 the Russian had returned with her 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:58.419
 and his heart 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.860
 I know I do not know you unemployment
