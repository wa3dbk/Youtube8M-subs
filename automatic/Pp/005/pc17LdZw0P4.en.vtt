00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.239
 Silver Monetary Policy Commissioner 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.669
 Schedule Hi everyone 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.880
 Your editor's account time has come 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170
 We always send you a half face 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.880
 It is difficult to see the skin 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.630
 The upper half is not 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.589
 This time 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.060
 About stroke 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060
 I want to learn yeah storock 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.310
 A downburst occurred that shook the corpse from the top 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.530
 From bottom to top 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.010
 I think that aps integration to pull up 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 There are these two types 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.910
 By combining these two types with each other 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.519
 Ronal rhythm stroke stroke also os 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.380
 I have another sleeping backing, too 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.780
 Like that combination 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.180
 Yes, but it will make it possible to stroke 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.740
 To become and 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.409
 I think it's iron again 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.409
 Both topped with 9 points for renewal 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.690
 That person cutting 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.950
 Old 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.240
 Like 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.330
 That person too 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.870
 Judgment 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 From the basics I'm getting tired 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.270
 class 6 wins 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.400
 Record data as strokes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.870
 That rhythm is the most important thing 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.760
 Can you keep it with curiosity 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.630
 If you are a band guy 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 I wonder if the new tower I told edram 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.280
 After all, it leads to the good feeling 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 The house meter was bad too 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.580
 While adjusting to about 3 meters 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.080
 Modern type 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.910
 When it comes to be able to expand the advancement of being 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.899
 Favorite artists also play their cds 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.069
 I also try to match the doctor 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.269
 I think it is a very good training method 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.089
 Low carbon recording 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.319
 Even more than tu sense to pull evenly 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.849
 At the beginning of that 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.839
 How are you doing that bass 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.839
 I forgot about luck 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.310
 Japanese painting 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.299
 I think that there is a firm thing 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.299
 Cut up * 6 in 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.739
 It is to use only in the mouth with that apps 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.600
 It is relatively small 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.150
 It is good for men to overwhelm with stroke and set 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.800
 Because 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.570
 If you try to listen firmly to translate 6 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.199
 At that time I will leave in the way of this prefecture 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.679
 I'm talking about new 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:54.989
 smoothly 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.419
 that 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.199
 Because it goes small and becomes valuable 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.899
 After pulling the dance and rock 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.800
 I mean that pair 0 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.299
 The lyrics happen to be high 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.879
 2 I'm going to give you a sense, so I'll come 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.999
 It became warm gradually 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.999
 Then the high monk of Tang 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.949
 I will be able to do strength 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.669
 If it's a high school week that acoustic that has come to something 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.969
 It is also chasing 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.969
 How many points like this 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.749
 We have shaken off, but shifted to the afforestation project 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.519
 My husband gets hard 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.479
 On the contrary, the sound hole on the night or 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.739
 There is a way to become negative and use it separately 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.429
 Become 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.659
 There is also a performance 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.659
 I'm going to go there separately 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:53.859
 Also 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.859
 Variations of colors as you learn the basics 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.860
 As I said at the beginning 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.209
 Because you will be able to 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.259
 So 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.920
 After that, I think it's out 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.879
 It is often considered as the driver of that person 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.419
 It will be very 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.469
 It is said that we will practice well unless specified in Japan 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.499
 I can not do it 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.400
 It is suburbs 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.060
 It's the best to get rid of scoops on the street or after 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.150
 It's best to practice on top of things, but it's a hut 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.080
 It's like going this way 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.749
 If it's not a trigger, you won't be able to do tu 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.370
 It will be called Shall 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.780
 When I just bought a guitar, I said pdp. 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.780
 No matter how high you are from 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.300
 Then why do you say that how to make it age 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.300
 Things are doing well 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.900
 The sound from this sound hole is through the heart 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900
 It will come out, but 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.749
 There is also a thing of heat well 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.609
 Let's give it an agenda that will give it a body like that 

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:04.210
 Because 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.020
 Guitarist's 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.059
 It is also a role 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:11.059
 Dekore A little talk will be made back home 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.080
 In two major manufacturers that Japan boasts sleeping on the second floor of home 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.870
 That kind of system 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.379
 It is also from the appearance but 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.159
 The town's maker of that finished guitar 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.169
 In that room of loud sound 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.080
 It seems that one phrase 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.550
 So that firmly 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.539
 I can do that with the body of my guitar 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.849
 Slightly raise at the same time 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:36.810
 High 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.099
 We 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.309
 For example 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.309
 Update even strokes 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.089
 Even if it is on a certain page 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.289
 Gothic get drunk in a week 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.469
 I heard it is 100,000 yen, but 150,000 tones come to come out 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.309
 The first 56 yen 69 sen while somehow 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:59.139
 An empty maze has passed over hundreds of thousands of yen 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.339
 Come out 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.550
 The story turned to a sidewalk 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.589
 The practice of this stop is also 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.869
 Even if you can get to some extent 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:12.249
 Don't be stupid 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.909
 Light firmly 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.119
 If you follow the basics faithfully 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.930
 I think that the further improvement will be faster 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.349
 That guitar too 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.729
 It's supposed to be so good 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:25.939
 I think so 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:30.300
 It is more than this time and the corresponding bus
