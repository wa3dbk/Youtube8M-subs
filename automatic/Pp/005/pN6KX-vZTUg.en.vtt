00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 interesting on the world of tanks from 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.550
 lamp years to high-quality highlight 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.620

 I’m a tap with you and today we look at

 the next issue of the heading deer and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.650

 games all sorts of browsers if you are a little 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.170
 tired of the tanks you can and in them 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.030
 have fun will not regret the first with us 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 such two fawn on yag pz e100 as we 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.640
 we see more enemies left but we 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 a squad of two kids who on 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.989
 top fri-shka hf catches 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 and see that just a couple 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.480
 go to the gut 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 1st bullpen takes you to the April 2 at breaks 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 here even with his platoon but what 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.309
 happen further incomprehensibly first 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.979
 why on the guys put your god 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.090
 parade from the city begin to disassemble but 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 just some kind of nightmare is going to happen now 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.009
 sovzvodny kills his won under bent 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.970
 clans given Sovzvodnye kills 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.549
 its sovzvodnogo it is not clear why and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.909
 why because of 3 was not at all 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.270
 lumbago and he would never get him well 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.920
 it 's not all start to clinch Isa 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 Third if you do not know about the alleged 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 e100 gun one of the most penetrative in 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.479
 game and one-time damage a thousand fifty 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.880
 units that is no problem should 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.250
 you have to be with yourself and third yes in general 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.579
 with one of the tank shoot i in the cap 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.090
 until almost into the mask punching but our 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.390
 Fawn is not able to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.399
 why did they both go together at all 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.579
 sides to merge but not 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.969
 taken away from 3 1 generally sovzvodny killed 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.420
 here is such a fun start well and fight 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.930
 naturally slide because of them brave l. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 all light 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.480
 battle on the map of the mines and in the end already well 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.090
 what remains to do is need a ring thread 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.170
 artillery two artifacts stayed behind 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.200
 my cowshed 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.190
 and control from both departure well climbs on 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.060
 they make no sense so our l. 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.750
 just their x-rays but it was not there 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.470
 Allied E50 pulls up and that makes 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.860
 pushes the poor thing out and understandably 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 kill before small t-70 first killed 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.440
 art discharged e50 with impunity on it 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.160
 shoots here is such a lust kid on 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.000
 E50 m further we will go some 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.910
 strange orgy on the maps degree 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.080
 we see that we only have t67 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.800
 with one projectile com enemy 1k in 1 a 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.200
 the time is still a whole lot more than eight 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.370
 minutes friends and here begins the most 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.970
 interesting 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.840
 yes this is a head-on fight to whom 1 can 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.230
 be unaware that ours has the t 67 already 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.720
 over the shells the tenth 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.910
 frag already in his piggy bank and our hero 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.590
 understands but what he should do 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.950
 go around you have to try it somehow 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.860
 highlight and draw something to draw but 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.560
 to you first he is such a bloke not a blunder 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.900
 logically you need to go to capture well 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.970
 who who will be on whom first is hard 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.220
 Soviet tank of the fifth level in which 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.850
 speeds generally at speeds and just 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.799
 there is no 67 at the time, but it’s such 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.110
 mini hellcat whose speed is just 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.690
 prohibitively and naturally you 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.549
 no way to catch the only one 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.410
 output in this situation, especially since 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.880
 time was eight and a half minutes 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.239
 getting to grab 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.799
 but whom the first guy is very very 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.950
 strange he gets up near the circle of capture 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.959
 occupies a position not even in the bushes bushes 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.709
 literally a meter behind him and just 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.850
 we turn on rewinding to x8 and see 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.860
 how time melts 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.080
 friends I will remind you eight and a half 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.570
 minutes left 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.240
 shells at our hero whom no one 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.700
 just standing and waiting for something what he expects 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.400
 it's unclear why he might as well 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.960
 could not get up in the circle of capture and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.390
 grab parallel base right here 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.910
 for some reason he took it and disappeared 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.770
 that four minutes in a row glowed 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.610
 does not seem to even move and just 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.220
 disappeared but the devil knows but here he is not 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.400
 he sleeps not africa only happens over 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.230
 the light of our hero whom 1 immediately begins 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.720
 shoot that is guy this show is there 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.940
 eat more or not found there in the toilet 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.670
 by and large he just stood these all 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.370
 eight and a half minutes and just 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:04.690
 just waited and here it remains only 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.780
 one minute you hide then she remembers no 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.400
 shells to you first and do not understand 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.080
 what he does what he hopes to 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.850
 him he will come out with our hero 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.860
 full 360dp need to take the onion base 1 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.530
 for some reason never realized it and when 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.260
 30 seconds left on the opposite he 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.430
 for some reason it becomes a circle of capture 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.280
 why this could not be done before 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.150
 totally incomprehensible well and how i already 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.630
 said today we have some such 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.880
 incomprehensible steppes because it is not yet 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.360
 last replay on this map with 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.090
 deer see remains from and from 2 against 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.310
 they are one single firefly that 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.640
 need to do by the way time there too 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.400
 six seven seconds was still two snouts 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.070
 normal combat mode i.e. base is taken 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.880
 together there is literally a little more than 40 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.610
 seconds but no our guys start 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.250
 ride the cards friends steppe up from and 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.090
 not so slow tanks but my mother 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.400
 woman against you same l. reach for 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.530
 capture them she's just sooner or later on 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.610
 you will moreover have almost 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.760
 thousand kp 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.190
 each one of them guesses but 2 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.140
 for some reason, he does not want to help him 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.760
 position near stones trying to someone 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.550
 see especially with weights 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.460
 review in general 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.700
 this one should be expected through 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.040
 a couple of seconds literally l. will come and 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.920
 will begin to shoot down from our isa at that time 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.600
 like from 2 control from somewhere else 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.640
 he doesn't care about another plane 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.950
 there at the seizure he does not want to help 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.860
 friends would he help already 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.170
 given a second they would take here and 37 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.840
 by the way which is only 89 kopecks 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.720
 left a margin of safety knocks down then 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.510
 also sets fire to and makes half already alive 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.550
 from and from the second such well yes I will go to that 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.560
 side of the genie lt-shki anyway will 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.840
 wait for me there a couple of minutes and in the end 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.570
 there is no one there because l. 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.840
 by itself traveled and on the other 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.210
 hand ready to call well and not old 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.580
 like a deer where it rides and by the way 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.940
 again knocking mister over here over here 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.980
 so 6 7 minutes about skating, I again draw 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.530
 something with steppes going on today 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.750
 I hope friends you liked it 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.880

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.490
