00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the map and you can go over it you can

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
the map and you can go over it you can

go under it you can go left of it can go

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
go under it you can go left of it can go
right<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.930> diagonal<00:00:55.530> over<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
right for you can go diagonal over you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
right for you can go diagonal over you
do<00:00:56.520> anything<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.199> way

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
do anything but this is the only way

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.319 
do anything but this is the only way
really<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.489> no<00:00:59.640> clip<00:00:59.910> through<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
really to actually no clip through the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
really to actually no clip through the
map<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.620> tried<00:01:02.039> just

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
map because if you have tried just

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
map because if you have tried just
flying<00:01:02.940> around<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.449> theater<00:01:03.780> mode<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.140> will

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
flying around in theater mode you will

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
flying around in theater mode you will
get<00:01:04.439> caught<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> lot<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> things<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.900> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
get caught on a lot of things and it is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.020 
get caught on a lot of things and it is
very<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.320> annoying<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.760> can

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
very very annoying but with this you can

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.289 
very very annoying but with this you can
fly<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.420> terrain<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.590> fly<00:01:10.860> over

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
fly over terrain you can fly over

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
fly over terrain you can fly over
anything<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.720> go<00:01:12.869> through<00:01:13.200> buildings

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
anything can go through buildings

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
anything can go through buildings
through<00:01:14.010> walls<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:15.270> long<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
through walls as long as you have the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
through walls as long as you have the
two<00:01:16.259> cameras<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> tricky<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
two cameras up it's kind of tricky and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.490 
two cameras up it's kind of tricky and
you<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> know<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.350> you're

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
around with it a little bit and get a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
around with it a little bit and get a
feel<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
know just just just go with it you know

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
know just just just go with it you know
what<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.780> remember<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> if

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
what you want to also remember that if

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
what you want to also remember that if
you're<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.270> first<00:01:33.479> camera<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you're what if your first camera is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
you're what if your first camera is
pointing<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.890> location<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.850> pointing

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
pointing at one location like pointing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.420 
pointing at one location like pointing
in<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.420> way<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.770> other<00:01:37.890> camera<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
in one way and then your other camera is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.330 
in one way and then your other camera is
pointing<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.409> another<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
pointing in another way you have to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
pointing in another way you have to
consider<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.320> movement<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
consider the movement that is going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
consider the movement that is going to
do<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:43.979> there's<00:01:44.399> their<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.000> extreme

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
do because there's their two extreme

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
do because there's their two extreme
points<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.250> transition<00:01:47.729> between<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
points and so the transition between the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
points and so the transition between the
two<00:01:48.450> are<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.979> effect

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
two are going to have a bit of an effect

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
two are going to have a bit of an effect
which<00:01:50.460> you'll<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.290> tried<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> do

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
which you'll see from this I tried to do

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.330 
which you'll see from this I tried to do
here<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> kind<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.030> crazy<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.600> annoying

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
here which is kind of crazy and annoying

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.380 
here which is kind of crazy and annoying
but<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.820> sure<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.270> well

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
but you have to be sure that it's well

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
but you have to be sure that it's well
timed<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> cameras<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.799> facing<00:01:59.250> good

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
timed and the cameras are facing good

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.999 
timed and the cameras are facing good
directions<00:02:00.030> otherwise<00:02:00.630> something<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
directions otherwise something like this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
directions otherwise something like this
will<00:02:02.250> happen<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.939> then<00:02:03.180> you'll<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.630> go

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
will happen and then you'll just go

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
will happen and then you'll just go
completely<00:02:04.369> do<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.860> that'll<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.250> that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
completely do that and that'll be that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
completely do that and that'll be that
