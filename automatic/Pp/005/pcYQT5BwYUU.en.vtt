technique<00:00:02.159> it's<00:00:03.030> called<00:00:03.120> wall<00:00:03.929> magic<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.370> is

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
technique it's called wall magic this is

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.770 
technique it's called wall magic this is
an<00:00:05.670> example<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:06.480> one<00:00:07.200> way<00:00:07.700> where<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.730> use<00:00:09.240> two

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
an example of one way where I use two

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.570 
an example of one way where I use two
colors<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.410> grey<00:00:10.940> the<00:00:11.940> light<00:00:12.830> gray<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.309> dark

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
colors of grey the light gray and a dark

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.689 
colors of grey the light gray and a dark
gray<00:00:17.720> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.410> same<00:00:19.710> type<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.100> technique

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
gray this is the same type of technique

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.800 
gray this is the same type of technique
using<00:00:21.359> white<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.199> light<00:00:22.470> beige<00:00:23.600> it's<00:00:24.600> very

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
using white and a light beige it's very

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.710 
using white and a light beige it's very
subtle<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.550> great<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.060> hiding<00:00:27.269> any

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
subtle but it's great for hiding any

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.870 
subtle but it's great for hiding any

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
technique I just showed you you use a

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.009 
technique I just showed you you use a
roller<00:00:47.199> like<00:00:47.469> this<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:48.579> can<00:00:48.730> see<00:00:49.000> here<00:00:49.659> that<00:00:49.839> I

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
roller like this you can see here that I

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.509 
roller like this you can see here that I
have<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.379> rollers<00:00:50.680> on<00:00:50.890> their<00:00:51.190> two<00:00:51.370> small

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
have the rollers on their two small

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.689 
have the rollers on their two small
rollers<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:53.469> be<00:00:53.829> afraid<00:00:53.949> if<00:00:54.370> you<00:00:54.489> can't

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
rollers don't be afraid if you can't

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.119 
rollers don't be afraid if you can't
find<00:00:54.940> rollers<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.600> fit<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.899> exactly<00:00:56.440> sometimes

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
find rollers to fit it exactly sometimes

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.160 
find rollers to fit it exactly sometimes
I<00:00:57.309> have<00:00:57.399> a<00:00:57.460> hard<00:00:57.519> time<00:00:57.820> even<00:00:58.750> if<00:00:59.019> they're

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
I have a hard time even if they're

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.549 
I have a hard time even if they're
shorter<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.769> works<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:01.539> do<00:01:01.600> sell<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.110> tray

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
shorter it works they do sell a tray

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.259 
shorter it works they do sell a tray
that<00:01:02.829> has<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.039> divider<00:01:03.489> in<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.820> middle<00:01:04.059> but

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
color where it's not mixing and then you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.160

going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.150> use<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.810> brush<00:03:06.710> here<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.230> small

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
going to use a brush here just a small

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.120 
going to use a brush here just a small
brush<00:03:10.420> I'll<00:03:11.420> start<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.930> one<00:03:12.140> color<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.950> get

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
brush I'll start with one color just get

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.750 
brush I'll start with one color just get
a<00:03:13.160> little<00:03:13.370> bit<00:03:13.580> on<00:03:13.730> there<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:16.220> just<00:03:16.250> blend

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
a little bit on there and you just blend

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.080 
a little bit on there and you just blend
it<00:03:16.970> wherever<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.780> see<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.410> tap<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:19.940> it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
it wherever you see I tap it on so it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.440 
it wherever you see I tap it on so it
has<00:03:20.120> more<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.780> same<00:03:20.990> effect<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:23.300> can

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
has more of the same effect and you can

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.300 
has more of the same effect and you can
see<00:03:23.630> where<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.870> red<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> top<00:03:24.860> and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
see where the red is on the top and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.900 
see where the red is on the top and
that's<00:03:26.270> how<00:03:26.480> I'll<00:03:26.660> add<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> corner

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that's how I'll add it to the corner

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.250 
that's how I'll add it to the corner
I'll<00:03:28.910> go<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.540> I'll<00:03:29.630> get<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.500> green<00:03:31.190> color

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.340 

using<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.500> same<00:03:36.739> brush<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.640> does<00:03:38.170> blend<00:03:39.170> in

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
using the same brush so it does blend in

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.900 
using the same brush so it does blend in
the<00:03:39.440> colors<00:03:39.800> as<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:41.390> technique<00:03:41.840> does<00:03:42.910> just

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
the colors as the technique does just

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.090 
the colors as the technique does just
tap<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.209> in<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:48.350> just<00:03:48.590> use<00:03:48.739> your<00:03:48.890> brush

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
tap it in there so just use your brush

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.449 
tap it in there so just use your brush
go<00:03:49.459> along<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.970> side<00:03:50.470> just<00:03:51.470> use<00:03:51.680> your<00:03:51.709> eye<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
go along the side just use your eye and

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.440 
go along the side just use your eye and
blend<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.030> colors<00:03:53.360> as<00:03:53.660> they<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:56.330> I'll

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
blend in the colors as they and I'll

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.570 
blend in the colors as they and I'll
carry<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.870> color<00:03:57.080> over<00:03:57.560> you'll<00:03:57.830> see<00:03:58.070> some<00:03:58.310> red

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
carry the color over you'll see some red

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.449 
carry the color over you'll see some red
and<00:03:58.940> then<00:03:59.030> you'll<00:03:59.209> see<00:03:59.420> some<00:03:59.690> green<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:01.280> can

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
and then you'll see some green you can

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.540 
and then you'll see some green you can
go<00:04:01.580> back<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:01.850> take<00:04:02.470> your<00:04:03.470> roller<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:04.190> just<00:04:04.400> go

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
go back and take your roller and just go

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.810 
go back and take your roller and just go
close<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.209> side<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:07.040> case<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.580> want

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
close to the side just in case you want

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.300 
close to the side just in case you want
to<00:04:07.940> smooth<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.510> out<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.690> little<00:04:08.930> bit<00:04:09.100> but<00:04:10.100> that's

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
to smooth it out a little bit but that's

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.760 
to smooth it out a little bit but that's
about<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.700> try<00:04:11.390> not<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.630> be<00:04:11.900> perfect<00:04:12.440> it's<00:04:12.590> not

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
about it try not to be perfect it's not

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.400 
about it try not to be perfect it's not
supposed<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.070> be<00:04:13.160> perfect<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.760> remember<00:04:14.360> to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
supposed to be perfect just remember to

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.310 
supposed to be perfect just remember to
turn<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.620> roller<00:04:15.860> up<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.690> down<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:17.930> around

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
turn the roller up and down and around

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.650 
turn the roller up and down and around
so<00:04:18.770> each<00:04:18.919> color<00:04:19.220> gets<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.609> both<00:04:19.880> sides<00:04:20.239> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
so each color gets on both sides and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.870 
so each color gets on both sides and
there<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.680> go

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.840 

be<00:04:26.780> sure<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.170> watch<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.380> my<00:04:27.770> next<00:04:28.010> videos<00:04:28.460> I'll

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.850 
show you how I achieve this look it's
paint<00:04:31.820> though<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.480> does<00:04:32.720> look<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:32.990> tile<00:04:33.500> I

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
paint though it does look like tile I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.170 
paint though it does look like tile I
have<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.940> in<00:04:35.090> my<00:04:35.330> kitchen<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.930> backsplash

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.910 

this<00:04:41.180> technique<00:04:41.690> i'm<00:04:42.050> using<00:04:42.530> blaze<00:04:43.490> and

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
this technique i'm using blaze and

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.410 
this technique i'm using blaze and
several<00:04:45.920> different<00:04:46.220> colors<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:47.060> gives<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.390> a

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
several different colors it gives you a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.380 
several different colors it gives you a
washed<00:04:47.810> antique<00:04:48.470> look<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:52.120> then<00:04:53.120> this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
washed antique look and then this

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.940
