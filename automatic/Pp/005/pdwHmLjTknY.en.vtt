let's hope when an if NIST decides to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.670 
let's hope when an if NIST decides to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
make the new signal permanent they at

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.199 
make the new signal permanent they at
least<00:02:12.800> give<00:02:13.040> us<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.250> few<00:02:13.459> minutes<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.820> day<00:02:14.000> or

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
least give us a few minutes a day or

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.970 
least give us a few minutes a day or
even<00:02:14.450> per<00:02:14.630> hour<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.170> steady<00:02:15.410> phase<00:02:15.709> signal

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
even per hour of a steady phase signal

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.650 
even per hour of a steady phase signal
so<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> clock<00:02:16.640> doesn't<00:02:16.880> become<00:02:17.090> totally
