00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.510 
as well like I said this isn't a
foolproof<00:02:08.790> way<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.570> more<00:02:09.780> PW<00:02:10.320> PS<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.400> it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
foolproof way to get more PW PS but it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.270 
foolproof way to get more PW PS but it
does<00:02:11.730> increase<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> chance<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:13.080> those<00:02:13.560> events

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
does increase the chance of those events

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.120 
does increase the chance of those events
happening<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:16.140> long<00:02:16.350> as<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> decrease<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
happening as long as you decrease the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.920 
happening as long as you decrease the
chance<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.520> other<00:02:17.760> events<00:02:17.910> happening<00:02:18.209> so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
chance of other events happening so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.020 
chance of other events happening so
you're<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.080> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> run<00:02:19.440> around<00:02:19.530> town

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
you're just going to run around town

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.980 
you're just going to run around town
looking<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.180> any<00:02:21.270> villages<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.780> may<00:02:21.930> be

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
looking for any villages that may be

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.770 
looking for any villages that may be
outside<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.580> once<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.300> do<00:02:24.600> not

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
outside if you do it once and you do not

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.370 
outside if you do it once and you do not
get<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.500> public<00:02:26.310> works<00:02:26.459> project<00:02:26.820> request<00:02:27.380> then

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
get a public works project request then

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.250 
get a public works project request then
the<00:02:29.010> answer<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.430> quite<00:02:29.550> simple<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:31.050> take

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the answer is quite simple you go take

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.440 
the answer is quite simple you go take
another<00:02:31.500> swim<00:02:31.680> uh-huh

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
another swim uh-huh

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
another swim uh-huh
you<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.260> long<00:02:34.530> as<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.830> want<00:02:35.330> like

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
you do this for as long as you want like

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.210 
you do this for as long as you want like
I<00:02:36.450> said<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.020> foolproof<00:02:37.410> method<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
I said it's not a foolproof method of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.910 
I said it's not a foolproof method of
doing<00:02:38.489> things<00:02:38.780> but<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.930> does<00:02:40.200> increase<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
doing things but it does increase the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.090 
doing things but it does increase the
chances<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.420> I'm<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.769> go<00:02:43.920> over

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
chances so I'm just going to go over

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.979 
chances so I'm just going to go over
here<00:02:44.280> chill<00:02:44.670> out<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.820> another<00:02:45.120> 5-10<00:02:45.480> minutes

guys are going to have a conversation

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.110 
guys are going to have a conversation
which<00:03:29.410> means<00:03:29.620> they<00:03:29.800> probably<00:03:30.010> weren't<00:03:30.730> doing

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
which means they probably weren't doing

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.700 
which means they probably weren't doing
us<00:03:32.670> nope<00:03:33.670> there's<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.330> surprise

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
us nope there's a surprise

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.010 
us nope there's a surprise
so<00:03:36.100> people<00:03:36.280> villagers<00:03:37.180> will<00:03:37.330> also<00:03:37.600> want<00:03:37.840> new

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
so people villagers will also want new

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.680 
so people villagers will also want new
greetings<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.680> catchphrases<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.480> kind

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
greetings and catchphrases so that kind

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.240 
greetings and catchphrases so that kind
of<00:03:40.750> sucks<00:03:41.020> but<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.710> know<00:03:41.740> there's<00:03:42.040> something

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
of sucks but you know there's something

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.340 
of sucks but you know there's something
you<00:03:42.310> got<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.490> live<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.930> fry<00:03:43.930> doesn't<00:03:44.170> want<00:03:44.290> us

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
you got to live with fry doesn't want us

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.630 
you got to live with fry doesn't want us
so<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.530> think<00:03:44.740> that's<00:03:44.860> all<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.070> our<00:03:45.250> outside

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
so I think that's all of our outside

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.710 
so I think that's all of our outside
villages<00:03:46.090> yet<00:03:46.390> again<00:03:47.340> what<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.520> will<00:03:48.850> do<00:03:49.230> is

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
villages yet again what I will do is

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.910 
villages yet again what I will do is
something<00:03:52.720> else<00:03:52.960> you<00:03:53.200> can<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.800> increase

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
something else you can do to increase

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.300 
something else you can do to increase
the<00:03:54.190> chance<00:03:54.490> of<00:03:55.230> getting<00:03:56.230> pwp<00:03:56.800> requests

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the chance of getting pwp requests

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.930 
the chance of getting pwp requests
rather<00:03:57.610> than<00:03:58.230> random<00:03:59.230> items<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.550> fill<00:04:00.910> up

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
rather than random items is to fill up

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.610 
rather than random items is to fill up
your<00:04:01.060> pockets<00:04:01.510> with<00:04:01.630> something<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.080> flowers

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
your pockets with something like flowers

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.220 
your pockets with something like flowers
which<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.040> villagers<00:04:03.430> can't<00:04:03.760> buy<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.420> it

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
which the villagers can't buy and it

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.980 
which the villagers can't buy and it
also<00:04:05.700> hogs<00:04:06.700> up<00:04:06.820> your<00:04:07.000> inventory<00:04:07.480> space<00:04:07.660> so

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
also hogs up your inventory space so

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.620 
also hogs up your inventory space so
they<00:04:08.110> can't<00:04:08.320> sell<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.590> stuff<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.450> that

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
they can't sell you stuff and so that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.730 
they can't sell you stuff and so that
they<00:04:10.750> cannot<00:04:12.840> give<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.930> stuff<00:04:14.170> for<00:04:14.200> free<00:04:14.590> as

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
they cannot give you stuff for free as

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.880 
they cannot give you stuff for free as
well<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.400> there's<00:04:16.359> another<00:04:16.540> little<00:04:16.750> tip<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:17.590> I

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
well so there's another little tip so I
