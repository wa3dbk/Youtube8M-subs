a R and the R stands for acid reflux and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.070 
a R and the R stands for acid reflux and
Emma<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:18.449> diagnosed<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.080> acid<00:00:19.470> reflux<00:00:21.080> she

Emma was diagnosed with acid reflux she

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.120 
Emma was diagnosed with acid reflux she
was<00:00:22.830> first<00:00:23.279> she<00:00:24.210> first<00:00:24.420> had<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:24.720> ultrasound<00:00:25.130> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
was first she first had an ultrasound to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.179 
was first she first had an ultrasound to
roll<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.170> pyloric<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.769> believe<00:00:29.039> it's

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
roll out the pyloric what I believe it's

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.389 
roll out the pyloric what I believe it's
called<00:00:29.900> one<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> muscles<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.740> increases

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
called one of the muscles that increases

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.049 
called one of the muscles that increases
are<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> most<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.149> empty<00:00:33.420> systemic<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
are the most the empty systemic and that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.639 
are the most the empty systemic and that
was<00:00:36.210> normal<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> doctor<00:00:37.200> diagnosed<00:00:37.620> her

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
was normal so the doctor diagnosed her

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
was normal so the doctor diagnosed her
with<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.129> sturdy<00:00:38.370> flix<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.989> getting<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
with a sturdy flix and it's getting to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
with a sturdy flix and it's getting to
the<00:00:40.469> point<00:00:40.530> where<00:00:40.770> she<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.219> throwing<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.760> her

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the point where she was throwing up her

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
the point where she was throwing up her
entire<00:00:42.390> bottle<00:00:45.440> wasn't<00:00:46.440> able<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> hold<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
entire bottle wasn't able to hold it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
entire bottle wasn't able to hold it
down<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.640> wasn't<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.270> she<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.350> pain

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
down and it wasn't that she was in pain

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.540 
down and it wasn't that she was in pain
or<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.090> bothered<00:00:51.570> her<00:00:51.750> too<00:00:52.020> much

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
or that it really bothered her too much

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.010 
or that it really bothered her too much
of<00:00:53.550> course<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.180> she<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.480> hungry<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
of course you know she was hungry and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
of course you know she was hungry and
that<00:00:55.079> bothered<00:00:55.440> her<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.000> she<00:00:57.000> wasn't<00:00:57.239> able<00:00:57.390> to

that bothered her but she wasn't able to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.310 
that bothered her but she wasn't able to
hold<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> so<00:01:00.079> Enfamil<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:03.320> it's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
hold it in so Enfamil they are and it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.880 
hold it in so Enfamil they are and it's
made<00:01:05.040> force<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.320> it's<00:01:07.320> been<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> few<00:01:07.619> babies

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
made force but up it's been a few babies

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.080 
made force but up it's been a few babies
and<00:01:08.760> basically<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.570> has<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.110> rice<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:11.430> rice

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and basically it has a rice a rice

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
and basically it has a rice a rice
starch<00:01:12.570> added<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> throwing<00:01:14.250> us

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
starch added into it so like throwing us

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.469 
starch added into it so like throwing us
a<00:01:14.520> meal<00:01:14.670> added<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> formula<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:20.479> we've

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a meal added into the formula and we've

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
a meal added into the formula and we've
been<00:01:21.630> using<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.830> has<00:01:23.040> definitely

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

can see it films there's like a coat a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.450 
can see it films there's like a coat a
film<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.090> bottle<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.570> flows<00:02:55.460> like

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
film in the bottle and it flows like

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.630 
film in the bottle and it flows like
normal<00:02:57.120> formulas<00:02:57.660> sometimes<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
normal formulas sometimes but if it's

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.400 
normal formulas sometimes but if it's
not<00:02:59.910> mixed<00:03:00.210> correctly<00:03:00.660> or<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:00.960> there's<00:03:01.170> a

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
not mixed correctly or if there's a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.540 
not mixed correctly or if there's a
larger<00:03:02.190> clump<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.270> formula<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:05.040> mixed<00:03:05.400> in

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
larger clump of the formula not mixed in

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.710 
larger clump of the formula not mixed in
it<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:05.970> clog<00:03:06.300> litical<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.270> have<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.570> make

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
it will clog litical so we have to make

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.380 
it will clog litical so we have to make
sure<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.050> she's<00:03:10.290> sucking<00:03:11.030> or<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.270> when

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
sure that she's sucking or that when

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.670 
sure that she's sucking or that when
she's<00:03:12.660> feeding<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.320> she's<00:03:13.500> actually

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
she's feeding that she's actually

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.110 
she's feeding that she's actually
getting<00:03:13.950> formula<00:03:14.460> because<00:03:14.640> she<00:03:14.880> gets<00:03:14.970> a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
getting formula because she gets a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.490 
getting formula because she gets a
little<00:03:15.210> frustrated<00:03:15.810> there's<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.110> key<00:03:16.260> coming

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
little frustrated there's a key coming

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.350 
little frustrated there's a key coming
out<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.920> we've<00:03:17.550> been<00:03:17.640> having<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.030> clean<00:03:18.240> out

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
formula that she needs and and it's

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.040 
formula that she needs and and it's
chained<00:03:30.510> down<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:33.500> another<00:03:34.500> thing<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:34.950> we

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
chained down and another thing that we

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.050 
chained down and another thing that we
excuse<00:03:37.050> me<00:03:37.200> just<00:03:38.040> started<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.520> knows<00:03:38.700> tonight

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
little bit and finally holding her legs

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.180 
little bit and finally holding her legs
back<00:04:09.180> she<00:04:09.570> was<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.810> wasn't<00:04:10.110> past<00:04:10.500> past<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
back she was it wasn't past past the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:19.550 
back she was it wasn't past past the
stools<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:14.580> they<00:04:14.760> were<00:04:14.820> dry<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.870> end<00:04:19.200> of

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
stools and so they were dry the end of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.349 
stools and so they were dry the end of
the<00:04:19.709> store<00:04:20.010> was<00:04:20.250> an<00:04:20.400> ass<00:04:20.580> dry<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.090> there<00:04:21.270> was

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
the store was an ass dry so there was

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.120 
the store was an ass dry so there was
more<00:04:21.600> moisture<00:04:23.120> so

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
more moisture so

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.700 

that's<00:04:26.850> probably<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.270> con<00:04:27.660> through<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.500> whole

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
that's probably a con through this whole

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.260 
that's probably a con through this whole
entire<00:04:28.830> thing<00:04:29.010> yeah<00:04:29.460> she's<00:04:29.730> able<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.000> keep<00:04:30.150> it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
entire thing yeah she's able to keep it

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.600 
entire thing yeah she's able to keep it
down<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:30.810> she's<00:04:31.560> having<00:04:31.710> trouble<00:04:31.920> getting<00:04:32.460> it

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.530 
down but she's having trouble getting it
out<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:37.340> think<00:04:38.340> that's<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:39.060> definitely

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540
