Fort Lauderdale's completed five passes
in<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.040> row<00:02:03.220> make<00:02:03.760> it<00:02:03.880> six<00:02:04.180> my<00:02:05.170> parents<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.830> my

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
in a row make it six my parents and my

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.070 
in a row make it six my parents and my
grandparents<00:02:06.640> both<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:07.150> think<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.600> they<00:02:08.050> just

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
grandparents both I think that they just

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.350 
grandparents both I think that they just
their<00:02:08.860> leadership<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.090> way<00:02:10.210> they've

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
their leadership and the way they've

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.700 
their leadership and the way they've
raised<00:02:10.600> me<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.869> everything<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.290> think<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.560> just

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
raised me and everything I think it just

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.340 
raised me and everything I think it just
really<00:02:12.580> helped<00:02:12.850> mold<00:02:13.030> me<00:02:13.210> into<00:02:13.240> who<00:02:14.020> they<00:02:14.050> are

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
really helped mold me into who they are

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.410 
really helped mold me into who they are
because<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.890> think<00:02:15.130> they're<00:02:15.250> role<00:02:15.880> models<00:02:15.910> so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
because I think they're role models so

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.510 
because I think they're role models so
to<00:02:16.990> just<00:02:17.110> see<00:02:17.290> them<00:02:17.410> lead<00:02:17.740> by<00:02:17.860> example<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.310> think

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
to just see them lead by example I think

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.550 
to just see them lead by example I think
it's<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> great<00:02:18.730> thing<00:02:18.820> for<00:02:19.560> their
