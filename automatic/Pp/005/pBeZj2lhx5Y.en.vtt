00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.400 
out wow this is really light as well it
looks<00:01:46.730> kind<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:47.030> heavy<00:01:47.150> just<00:01:48.020> looking<00:01:48.230> at<00:01:48.320> the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
looks kind of heavy just looking at the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.410 
looks kind of heavy just looking at the
packaging<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.040> thought<00:01:49.220> it'd<00:01:49.310> be<00:01:49.340> heavier<00:01:50.240> than

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
packaging I thought it'd be heavier than

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.900 
packaging I thought it'd be heavier than
the<00:01:50.480> ears<00:01:50.660> but<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.650> really<00:01:51.770> liked<00:01:52.100> but

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
the ears but actually really liked but

the ears but actually really liked but
we'll<00:01:53.300> take<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.480> closer<00:01:53.720> look

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
we'll take a closer look

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
in a second we'll pull that to the side

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.430 
in a second we'll pull that to the side
and<00:01:55.910> see<00:01:56.450> what<00:01:56.600> else<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.870> there<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.229> take

out we have the USB cable in there so 1

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.110 
out we have the USB cable in there so 1
meter<00:02:17.440> USB<00:02:18.440> cable<00:02:18.800> for<00:02:18.950> recharging<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.700> USB

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
meter USB cable for recharging it so USB

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.440 
meter USB cable for recharging it so USB
to<00:02:20.300> micro-usb<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.890> side<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.430> then<00:02:23.240> this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
to micro-usb on that side and then this

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.090 
to micro-usb on that side and then this
is<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.660> audio<00:02:23.990> cable<00:02:24.170> itself<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.010> you

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
is the audio cable itself so if you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.850 
is the audio cable itself so if you
don't<00:02:25.250> wanna<00:02:25.370> use<00:02:25.640> e<00:02:25.750> with<00:02:26.860> wireless

wearing it for prolonged period of time

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.950 
wearing it for prolonged period of time
it's<00:04:25.460> important<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.850> if<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.120> feels<00:04:26.450> as

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
comfortable as possible and it's not

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.310 
comfortable as possible and it's not
going<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:28.669> in<00:04:28.940> your<00:04:29.060> ears<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.110> side

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
going to be in your ears so on this side

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.750 
going to be in your ears so on this side
you've<00:04:30.470> got<00:04:30.500> left<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:30.979> got<00:04:31.100> right<00:04:31.370> there<00:04:31.610> and

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
you've got left you got right there and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.540 
you've got left you got right there and
then<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.300> got<00:04:32.419> on<00:04:32.450> under<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:33.500> ear<00:04:33.800> controls<00:04:34.370> as

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
then you got on under on ear controls as

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.879 
then you got on under on ear controls as
well<00:04:34.729> so<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:34.940> got<00:04:35.090> forward<00:04:35.710> buttons<00:04:36.710> there

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
well so you got forward buttons there

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.409 
well so you got forward buttons there
and<00:04:37.250> backwards<00:04:37.669> as<00:04:37.760> well<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.090> can<00:04:38.180> change

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
and backwards as well so you can change

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.719 
and backwards as well so you can change
track<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.840> can<00:04:38.960> skip<00:04:39.200> skip<00:04:39.620> track<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.190> stuff

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
track you can skip skip track and stuff

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.550 
track you can skip skip track and stuff
you've<00:04:41.270> got<00:04:41.389> active<00:04:41.540> noise<00:04:41.900> cancellation<00:04:42.290> as

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
you've got active noise cancellation as

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.650 
you've got active noise cancellation as
well<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:42.950> this<00:04:43.100> will<00:04:43.220> reduce<00:04:43.660> background

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
well so this will reduce background

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.780 
well so this will reduce background
noise<00:04:44.930> back<00:04:45.229> up<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.470> 85%<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.490> there's<00:04:46.729> a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
noise back up to 85% so there's a

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.060 
noise back up to 85% so there's a
creative<00:04:47.360> claims<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.930> then<00:04:48.500> this<00:04:48.680> that's

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
creative claims and then this that's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.879 
creative claims and then this that's
where<00:04:49.280> your<00:04:49.460> audio<00:04:49.850> cable<00:04:50.150> would<00:04:50.240> go<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:51.200> then

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
where your audio cable would go to then

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.890 
where your audio cable would go to then
feed<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.250> out<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.640> your<00:04:52.850> audio<00:04:53.180> source<00:04:53.360> you've

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
feed it out to your audio source you've

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.510 
feed it out to your audio source you've
got<00:04:54.020> volume<00:04:54.140> control<00:04:54.680> on<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:54.830> side<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.460> is

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
got volume control on that side this is

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520 
got volume control on that side this is
where<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.880> tap<00:04:56.090> against<00:04:56.450> your<00:04:56.570> NF<00:04:56.810> NFC

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
where you tap against your NF NFC

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.590 
where you tap against your NF NFC
