00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
all the way over there because this air

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.820 
all the way over there because this air
is<00:01:28.140> wide<00:01:28.380> open<00:01:28.410> this<00:01:30.319> dresser<00:01:31.319> fits<00:01:31.619> up

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
against the wall just to about there

then there's this big gap and they're
probably<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.319> end<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.560> putting<00:01:37.800> a

for where the cable location was and I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.669 
for where the cable location was and I

could have done that there there's an
option<00:02:05.099> but<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.250> thought<00:02:05.489> you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.849> I<00:02:06.090> don't

option but I thought you know I don't
really<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.720> up

option I've decided there's two options
here<00:03:17.700> let's<00:03:17.910> talk<00:03:18.060> about<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.450> first<00:03:18.630> option

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
here let's talk about the first option

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.850 
here let's talk about the first option
that<00:03:19.260> I'm<00:03:19.500> not<00:03:19.800> going<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:21.320> okay<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.350> could

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
that I'm not going to do okay I could

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.810 
that I'm not going to do okay I could
put<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> cut<00:03:23.460> in<00:03:23.610> box<00:03:23.930> behind<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.290> TV<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.010> then

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
put a cut in box behind the TV and then

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.390 
put a cut in box behind the TV and then
I<00:03:26.940> could<00:03:27.150> fish<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> wire<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:28.140> down<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.220> where

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
I could fish a wire on down and where

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.340 
I could fish a wire on down and where
that<00:03:29.550> box<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.510> could<00:03:30.810> put<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.140> could

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
that box is there I could put I could

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.180 
that box is there I could put I could
cut<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.770> another<00:03:32.340> box<00:03:32.610> next<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:34.190> fish

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
cut in another box next to that and fish

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.230 
cut in another box next to that and fish
a<00:03:35.220> wire<00:03:36.470> from<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> top<00:03:37.860> there<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.610> down

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
a wire from the top there on down

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.670 
a wire from the top there on down
through<00:03:40.020> that<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:40.950> hole<00:03:41.340> right<00:03:41.670> there

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
through that to that hole right there

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.970 
through that to that hole right there
okay<00:03:43.710> then<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.850> would<00:03:45.030> have<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.600> take<00:03:46.470> some<00:03:46.740> wire

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
okay then I would have to take some wire

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.040 
okay then I would have to take some wire
mold<00:03:47.400> or<00:03:47.850> something<00:03:48.270> like<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.900> some

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
mold or something like that it's some

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.030 
mold or something like that it's some
Raceway<00:03:49.560> it's<00:03:50.130> an<00:03:50.310> exposed<00:03:50.790> wire<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:52.040> it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
Raceway it's an exposed wire and it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.560 
Raceway it's an exposed wire and it
comes<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.490> piece<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.820> track<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.360> get

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
comes in a piece of track you get

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.060 
comes in a piece of track you get
fittings<00:03:55.020> for<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.470> that's<00:03:55.590> how<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.770> was

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
fittings for it and that's how I was

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.160 
fittings for it and that's how I was
gonna<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.670> originally<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.780> you've<00:03:58.020> never

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
gonna do it originally if you've never

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.900 
gonna do it originally if you've never
installed<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.830> stuff<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.310> kind<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.580> slick

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
installed that stuff it's kind of slick

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.610 
installed that stuff it's kind of slick
and<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.420> would<00:04:00.630> have<00:04:00.780> had<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.230> done<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
and I would have had to have done that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.910 
and I would have had to have done that
had<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:01.860> not<00:04:02.010> had<00:04:02.520> an<00:04:02.900> attic<00:04:03.900> area<00:04:04.230> above<00:04:04.470> here

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
had I not had an attic area above here

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400 
had I not had an attic area above here
well<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.580> could<00:04:05.760> put<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.000> box<00:04:06.480> right<00:04:07.380> there

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
well I could put a box right there

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.020 
well I could put a box right there
against<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> wall<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.490> then<00:04:08.640> come<00:04:08.850> out<00:04:08.970> with

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
against the wall and then come out with

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.720 
against the wall and then come out with
some<00:04:09.330> wire<00:04:09.510> mold<00:04:09.840> go<00:04:10.110> down<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.980> floor<00:04:11.340> go

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
some wire mold go down the floor go

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.830 
some wire mold go down the floor go
across<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:13.160> over<00:04:14.160> put<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:15.030> surface<00:04:15.360> mounted

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
across and over put a surface mounted

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.000 
across and over put a surface mounted
box<00:04:16.109> on<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:17.000> electrical<00:04:18.000> outlet<00:04:18.560> box<00:04:19.560> and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
box on that electrical outlet box and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.520 
box on that electrical outlet box and
then<00:04:20.580> tie<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.060> into<00:04:21.330> there<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.170> can<00:04:22.320> still

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
then tie it into there and I can still

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.370 
then tie it into there and I can still
have<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> plug<00:04:23.100> there<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.960> then<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.050> would<00:04:25.230> end

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
have a plug there and then I would end

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.550 
have a plug there and then I would end
up<00:04:25.530> having<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:26.040> plug<00:04:26.280> over<00:04:26.520> here<00:04:28.070> okay<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.340> then

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
up having a plug over here okay and then

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.890 
up having a plug over here okay and then
I'd<00:04:31.560> have<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.100> wire<00:04:32.340> inside<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.300> wall

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
I'd have the wire inside the wall

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.010 
I'd have the wire inside the wall
going<00:04:34.650> up<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.420> would<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:36.780> be<00:04:36.900> a
