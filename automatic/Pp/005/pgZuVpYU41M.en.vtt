00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
 about another useful application 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.730
 literally just today it installed 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.400
 on your smartphone 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.789
 called at stake dispatcher dispatcher 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 calls him you can install it 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.310
 free from the play market and so what is it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 it may be useful to us often 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.579
 taking the smartphone in hand, I discover that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.410
 Some calls were missed by those that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.899
 determined I will always call you back 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 but there are some which are telephone 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.780
 which are undecided and I do not know if 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 I'll call for me whether it 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.030
 paid at all possible that there just 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.800
 someone made a mistake 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.730
 this phone may be perfectly 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.579
 another city about the one in the country just this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.300
 the application will help you understand where you have been 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.520
 made a call can you on it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.280
 call back without any fear to spend 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.590
 money or not exactly the same app 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.939
 google dispatcher will show you information 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.320
 with an incoming call, that is, if it 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.470
 a call comes in with a not lived cat and you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 immediately see who is calling from which 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 cities and so on it is also convenient so 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 let's try how it looks on 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.229
 several not yet defined 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.950
 rooms that are not lately 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.409
 came calling one number can see there 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.130
 bottom russia kaliningrad region or 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.659
 two in this way I immediately understand that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.659
 this call will be free for me 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.660
 that i am cool 2 phone number 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.360
 click on it see germany and dishes 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.070
 understandably this will be for me already 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.130
 for the money so I cancel it the truth 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.100
 if for example 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.820
 Incoming phone call arrange 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.820
 Now I take there 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:27.080
 lucky see minutes 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.080
 where does the house come from 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.570
 again very convenient to just 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.700
 to be guided who he calls why 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.900
 why and so on with regards to settings 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.500
 going here here here base 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.890
 you need to install the bases of all those countries 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.160
 of which you can expect some 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.220
 call as well as essentially every base there 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.530
 weighs a penny judging by the speed 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.170
 downloads so you can install everything 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 no matter how wrong you are for example Ukraine 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.550
 add 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.620
 install it all instantly 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.450
 therefore it is installed and added 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.250
 all this much you can install everything 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.180
 here settings are all in Russian, all 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.950
 convenient here you can ask how it will be 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.610
 look where the message will be 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.959
 positioned on it and so on 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.990
 further, but here everything is just you figure it out 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.570
 also have 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.110
 such a thing search here you can drive 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.960
 some incomprehensible phone number 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.800
 press the define button as I understand it 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.330
 he will come out 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.310
 on the Internet and understand who what what 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.960
 country which operator belongs 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.870
 this pray well as if this is not all 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.490
 I will delay the video thank you for 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.490
