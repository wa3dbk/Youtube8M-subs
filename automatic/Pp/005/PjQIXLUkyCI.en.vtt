plates are black tourmaline ceramic

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.880 
plates are black tourmaline ceramic
plates<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.720> makes<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.020> easiest<00:02:32.560> romic

plates so it makes the easiest romic
straighteners<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.340> lot<00:02:33.490> easier<00:02:33.670> for

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850

switch inside as you can see and also

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.110 
switch inside as you can see and also
next<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.360> doll<00:02:41.290> for<00:02:41.650> like

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
next to it is like a doll for like

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.850 
next to it is like a doll for like
adjusting<00:02:43.120> me<00:02:43.390> heat<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:44.350> now<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.650> hot<00:02:44.830> so

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
adjusting me heat right now it's hot so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.580 
adjusting me heat right now it's hot so
you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.130> see<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> red<00:02:45.550> light<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.560> heat

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
you can see the red light and the heat

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.220 
you can see the red light and the heat
starts<00:02:48.430> from<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:49.420> basically<00:02:49.630> has<00:02:49.810> two<00:02:50.019> heat

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
starts from just basically has two heat

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.840 
starts from just basically has two heat
settings<00:02:51.120> 60<00:02:52.120> degrees<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.010> 210<00:02:54.010> obviously

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
settings 60 degrees and 210 obviously

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.080 
settings 60 degrees and 210 obviously
you<00:02:54.940> can<00:02:55.180> put<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.140> between<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:57.010> 60<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.550> 210

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
you can put it in between the 60 and 210

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.150 
you can put it in between the 60 and 210
I<00:02:58.300> put<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.110> highest<00:02:59.290> one<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.010> makes

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
I put it to the highest one so it makes

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.310 
I put it to the highest one so it makes
a<00:03:00.310> quicker<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.760> easier<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.239> straighten<00:03:02.080> it

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
a quicker and easier to straighten it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.770 
a quicker and easier to straighten it
has<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> three<00:03:02.769> meter<00:03:03.010> cord<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.790> also<00:03:04.269> swivels

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
has a three meter cord and also swivels

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.720 
has a three meter cord and also swivels
so<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.049> won't<00:03:05.320> get<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.100> you'll

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
so you won't get to it you know you'll

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.970 
so you won't get to it you know you'll
wrap<00:03:07.120> your<00:03:07.420> hair<00:03:07.600> around<00:03:07.810> wrap<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.650> string

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
wrap your hair around wrap the string

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.800

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
around when you straighten your hair so

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.340 
around when you straighten your hair so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
it's easy to twist around is the 3-meter

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.280 
it's easy to twist around is the 3-meter
quarters<00:03:14.920> pretty<00:03:15.670> long<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.269> say<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.600> one<00:03:16.810> floor

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
quarters pretty long I say the one floor

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.900 
quarters pretty long I say the one floor
i<00:03:17.320> would<00:03:17.620> say<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.980> gets<00:03:18.160> pretty<00:03:18.459> hot

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
i would say it gets pretty hot

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.789 
i would say it gets pretty hot
especially<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:19.510> area<00:03:19.959> because<00:03:20.410> sometimes

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
especially this area because sometimes

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.380 
especially this area because sometimes
when<00:03:20.890> i'm<00:03:21.010> stretching<00:03:21.220> my<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.489> tend<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> move<00:03:22.209> my

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
when i'm stretching my I tend to move my

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.380 
when i'm stretching my I tend to move my
hands<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.690> bit<00:03:22.810> higher<00:03:23.019> up<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.560> know<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.640> it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
hands a bit higher up you know and it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.820 
hands a bit higher up you know and it
gets<00:03:25.600> pretty<00:03:25.900> hot<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.470> at<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.650> highest

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
gets pretty hot this is at the highest

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.490 
gets pretty hot this is at the highest
temperature<00:03:27.820> it's<00:03:28.390> really<00:03:28.870> really<00:03:29.080> hot<00:03:29.290> so

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
temperature it's really really hot so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.630 
temperature it's really really hot so
you<00:03:29.590> have<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.830> be<00:03:29.860> really<00:03:30.160> careful<00:03:30.310> when

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
you have to be really careful when

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.710 
you have to be really careful when
straighten<00:03:31.000> your<00:03:31.090> hair<00:03:31.150> not<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.540> burn

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
straighten your hair not to burn

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.000 
straighten your hair not to burn
yourself<00:03:32.280> because<00:03:33.280> normally<00:03:33.640> these<00:03:34.799> areas<00:03:35.799> of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
yourself because normally these areas of

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.009 
yourself because normally these areas of
the<00:03:36.160> straightener<00:03:36.489> shouldn't<00:03:36.820> be<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.060> hot<00:03:37.390> but

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
the straightener shouldn't be so hot but

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.960 
the straightener shouldn't be so hot but
it's<00:03:38.230> really<00:03:38.680> really<00:03:39.070> hot<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.730> just

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
it's really really hot like just just

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.600 
it's really really hot like just just
like<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:40.239> touching<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.350> plates<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.890> pretty

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
like I'm touching the plates is pretty

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.740

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
morning so I just basically started

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.809 
morning so I just basically started
straightening<00:03:58.719> the<00:03:59.109> hair<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.560> it<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.609> as

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
straightening the hair and it just as

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.179 
straightening the hair and it just as
you<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.329> see<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.810> left<00:04:02.079> really<00:04:02.560> smooth<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
you can see is left really smooth and

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.039 
you can see is left really smooth and
really<00:04:03.459> straight<00:04:03.969> and<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.239> think<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.719> iron<00:04:04.870> it

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
really straight and I think the iron it

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.239 
really straight and I think the iron it
properties<00:04:05.439> of<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.650> straightening<00:04:06.010> which<00:04:06.129> is

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:06.249 
properties of the straightening which is

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:08.970 
properties of the straightening which is
in<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.549> plate<00:04:06.790> hops<00:04:07.439> for<00:04:08.439> it<00:04:08.499> to<00:04:08.590> straighten

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
in the plate hops for it to straighten

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.069 
in the plate hops for it to straighten
faster<00:04:09.459> that's<00:04:09.670> why<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.849> gets<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.299> gets<00:04:10.569> so

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
faster that's why it gets it gets so

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.530 
faster that's why it gets it gets so
quick<00:04:11.439> and<00:04:11.650> easy<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.459> straighten<00:04:12.909> so<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.329> think

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
quick and easy to straighten so I think

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.740 
quick and easy to straighten so I think
that's<00:04:13.719> quite<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.019> good<00:04:14.290> touch<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.829> the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
that's quite a good touch to the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.050 
that's quite a good touch to the
straightener<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:16.959> has<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.530> UK<00:04:17.979> plug<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:19.000> I'm

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
straightener it's has a UK plug so I'm

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.999 
straightener it's has a UK plug so I'm
not<00:04:19.180> quite<00:04:19.329> sure<00:04:19.419> if<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.289> would<00:04:20.410> work<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.829> think

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
not quite sure if it would work I think

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.200 
not quite sure if it would work I think
you<00:04:21.070> might<00:04:21.160> have<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.519> something<00:04:21.820> if<00:04:22.060> your

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
you might have to get something if your

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.779 
you might have to get something if your
work<00:04:22.449> if<00:04:22.630> you're<00:04:22.900> not<00:04:23.500> in<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.740> UK<00:04:24.099> you<00:04:24.639> might

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
work if you're not in the UK you might

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.300 
work if you're not in the UK you might
have<00:04:24.849> to<00:04:24.970> get<00:04:25.060> an<00:04:25.180> adapter<00:04:25.410> for<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.130> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
have to get an adapter for it so the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.189 
have to get an adapter for it so the
straighteners<00:04:27.759> are<00:04:27.910> from<00:04:28.240> my<00:04:28.419> salon<00:04:28.930> looks

for the US and i'll put an annotation
here<00:04:46.690> somewhere<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:48.699> you<00:04:48.789> were<00:04:48.910> getting

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
here somewhere and so you were getting

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.719 
here somewhere and so you were getting
that<00:04:49.419> fifty<00:04:49.960> percent<00:04:50.289> off<00:04:50.560> so<00:04:50.830> half<00:04:51.070> price<00:04:51.430> of

that fifty percent off so half price of
the<00:04:52.000> original<00:04:52.449> values<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.979> would<00:04:54.130> be<00:04:54.280> 60

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
the original values so it would be 60

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:02.070 
the original values so it would be 60
euros<00:04:55.060> which<00:04:55.449> is<00:04:55.479> about<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:58.020> fifty<00:05:00.630> fifty<00:05:01.630> six
