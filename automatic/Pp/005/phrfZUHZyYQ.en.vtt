team um I do fast forward this game a
little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.079> rather<00:01:49.259> fast<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
little bit because it's rather fast and

afghan<00:02:06.950> for<00:02:07.950> domination<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.580> i<00:02:08.989> would<00:02:09.989> prefer

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
afghan for domination was i would prefer

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.280 
afghan for domination was i would prefer
having<00:02:10.860> seen<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.510> rather<00:02:12.510> than

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
having seen be rather than

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.349 
having seen be rather than
a<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.560> B<00:02:15.860> particularly<00:02:16.860> because<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.969> spawn

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
a and B particularly because the a spawn

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:24.229 
a and B particularly because the a spawn
is<00:02:18.629> far<00:02:19.560> away<00:02:19.680> from<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:21.890> sea<00:02:22.890> spawn<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:24.120> you're

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
is far away from the sea spawn so you're

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.000 
is far away from the sea spawn so you're
closer<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.750> um<00:02:27.409> got<00:02:28.409> pretty<00:02:28.620> lucky<00:02:28.769> they're

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
accurate and just more powerful to me I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.550 
accurate and just more powerful to me I
don't<00:03:47.579> know<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.139> mean<00:03:49.260> whatever<00:03:49.500> you

EMP if you don't really necessarily

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.760 
EMP if you don't really necessarily
think<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:11.949> need<00:05:12.099> kills<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:13.630> if<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.650> don't
