00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
underneath settings we have fold

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.600 
underneath settings we have fold
vertically<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.200> turn<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
vertically and if we turn that on it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.840 
vertically and if we turn that on it
will<00:00:48.120> allow<00:00:48.600> us<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.250> fold<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.430> screen

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
will allow us to fold our screen

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.689 
will allow us to fold our screen
vertically<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.370> gives<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
vertically just like that and it gives a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850 
vertically just like that and it gives a
pretty<00:00:53.969> cool<00:00:54.239> effect<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
pretty cool effect going up like this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.790 
pretty cool effect going up like this
now<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.789> other<00:00:56.820> cool<00:00:57.270> part<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.289> we

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
now the other cool part about this is we

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
now the other cool part about this is we
can<00:00:59.070> specify<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.239> number<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.989> slices<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
can specify the number of slices in the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.280 
can specify the number of slices in the
fold<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> way<00:01:04.080> up

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
fold and we can do that all the way up

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.280 
fold and we can do that all the way up
to<00:01:04.320> 10<00:01:04.979> i<00:01:05.010> believe<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.630> change<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to 10 i believe so we can change the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.820 
to 10 i believe so we can change the
number<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> slices<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.530> now<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.710> we

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
number of slices there and now when we

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.120 
number of slices there and now when we
go<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.420> slices<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> fold<00:01:13.830> or

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
go up we have more slices in the fold or

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.109 
go up we have more slices in the fold or
we<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.090> low<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.530> 1<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
we can go as low as 1 and that kind of

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.560 
we can go as low as 1 and that kind of
just<00:01:18.479> looks<00:01:18.750> weird<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
just looks weird but if you like it you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
just looks weird but if you like it you
can<00:01:21.930> set<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> also<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
can set that also down here at the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.020 
can set that also down here at the
bottom<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.270> change<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.080> unlock<00:01:25.830> text<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
bottom we can change the unlock text so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.710 
bottom we can change the unlock text so
we<00:01:27.509> could<00:01:27.689> set<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.909> jailbreak<00:01:31.250> advise<00:01:32.720> back

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
we could set it to jailbreak advise back

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.580 
we could set it to jailbreak advise back
out<00:01:35.060> now<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> bottom<00:01:37.020> jailbreak

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
out now we have at the bottom jailbreak

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.850 
out now we have at the bottom jailbreak
advice<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.360> pretty<00:01:39.540> cool<00:01:39.689> effect<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
advice it's a pretty cool effect and you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
advice it's a pretty cool effect and you
can<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.159> set<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> slices<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
can also set the slices or the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.740 
can also set the slices or the
horizontal<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.189> well<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.509> for

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
horizontal one as well I know it's for

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
horizontal one as well I know it's for
right<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.790> 28<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> as

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
