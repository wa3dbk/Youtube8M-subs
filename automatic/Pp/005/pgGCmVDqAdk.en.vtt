00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
meetings and things and I felt that all

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.830 
meetings and things and I felt that all
our<00:02:50.130> words<00:02:50.580> were<00:02:50.820> falling<00:02:51.239> on<00:02:51.390> stony<00:02:51.720> ground

so I decided for the sake of the kids to

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.750 
so I decided for the sake of the kids to
make<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.230> song<00:02:55.920> where<00:02:56.190> they<00:02:56.459> could<00:02:56.640> actually

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
make a song where they could actually

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.180 
make a song where they could actually
express<00:02:57.209> their<00:02:57.810> feelings<00:02:58.260> as<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.010> lead
