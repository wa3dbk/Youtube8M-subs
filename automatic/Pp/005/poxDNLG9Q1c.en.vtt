you try it now this is my old antenna I
built<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.500> stripped<00:01:34.829> coaxial<00:01:35.400> cable

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
built that's just stripped coaxial cable

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
built that's just stripped coaxial cable
hopefully<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:37.020> reception

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
hopefully this will get better reception

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
hopefully this will get better reception
I<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:41.030> damn<00:01:42.030> channel

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.260 
I'm going to move it around and see if I
can<00:02:42.770> get<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.920> little<00:02:43.070> better<00:02:43.400> straighten<00:02:44.120> out

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
can get a little better straighten out

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.660 
can get a little better straighten out
the<00:02:44.480> metal<00:02:44.750> prongs<00:02:44.990> a<00:02:45.290> little<00:02:45.500> bit<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:46.870> got<00:02:47.870> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
the metal prongs a little bit I got to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.420 
the metal prongs a little bit I got to
twenty<00:02:49.670> percent<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.510> little<00:02:50.900> bit<00:02:50.990> better<00:02:51.430> could

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
twenty percent a little bit better could

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.210 
twenty percent a little bit better could
put<00:02:52.580> up<00:02:52.700> hiring<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.210> more<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.770> I'm<00:02:54.770> redoing

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
put up hiring it more and I'm redoing

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.110 
put up hiring it more and I'm redoing
chance<00:02:55.580> can<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.680> got<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.860> tin<00:02:58.370> saved<00:02:58.850> already

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
chance can I got this tin saved already

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.880 
chance can I got this tin saved already
so<00:02:59.630> let's<00:02:59.840> see<00:02:59.960> if<00:03:00.020> I<00:03:00.080> get<00:03:00.140> one<00:03:00.350> more<00:03:00.410> channel

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
so let's see if I get one more channel

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.870 
so let's see if I get one more channel
and<00:03:01.220> I'm<00:03:01.340> gonna<00:03:01.430> check<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.790> channels<00:03:02.180> uh<00:03:02.800> yeah

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and I'm gonna check the channels uh yeah

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.210 
and I'm gonna check the channels uh yeah
strength<00:03:04.880> level<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.590> far<00:03:06.800> looks<00:03:06.950> like<00:03:07.100> I've

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
strength level so far looks like I've

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.580 
strength level so far looks like I've
gotten<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:08.240> haven't<00:03:08.720> gotten<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.990> bc<00:03:09.410> i've

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
gotten it I haven't gotten a bc i've

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.430 
gotten it I haven't gotten a bc i've
gotten<00:03:09.920> fox5<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.210> know<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.570> all<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.870> local

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
gotten fox5 you know and all the local

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.670 
gotten fox5 you know and all the local
stations<00:03:13.040> afraid<00:03:13.340> bc<00:03:14.080> which<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.110> America's

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
stations afraid bc which is America's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.540 
stations afraid bc which is America's
ABC<00:03:15.980> has<00:03:16.100> nothing<00:03:16.520> well<00:03:17.510> they<00:03:18.050> do<00:03:18.620> sometimes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.400 

synopsis<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:23.090> made<00:03:23.480> antenna<00:03:23.870> works<00:03:24.140> better

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
synopsis I made antenna works better

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.280 
synopsis I made antenna works better
than<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.770> one<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:24.950> built<00:03:25.280> before<00:03:25.610> out<00:03:26.290> coaxial

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
than the one I built before out coaxial

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.670 
than the one I built before out coaxial
it<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.700> wire<00:03:29.030> scrap<00:03:29.450> but<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.410> seems<00:03:30.590> to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
it is just wire scrap but it seems to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.830 
it is just wire scrap but it seems to
work<00:03:30.830> great<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.340> think<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.270> future<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.630> would

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
work great I think in the future I would

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.880 
work great I think in the future I would
try<00:03:33.200> making<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.510> wires<00:03:35.510> go<00:03:35.810> out<00:03:35.990> longer<00:03:36.470> I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
try making the wires go out longer I

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.730 
try making the wires go out longer I
think<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:37.970> would<00:03:38.150> help<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.570> also<00:03:38.690> maybe<00:03:39.110> add

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
think that would help and also maybe add

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.280 
think that would help and also maybe add
more<00:03:40.220> of<00:03:40.340> them<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:41.330> maybe<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.570> crisscross<00:03:41.870> one

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
more of them and maybe a crisscross one

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.840 
more of them and maybe a crisscross one
like<00:03:42.440> always<00:03:42.709> i'm<00:03:43.100> out<00:03:43.220> adding<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.610> crisscross

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
like always i'm out adding a crisscross

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.100 
like always i'm out adding a crisscross
one<00:03:44.300> on<00:03:44.390> top<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:45.070> think<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.130> meant<00:03:46.400> cooler

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
one on top I think that meant cooler

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.620 
one on top I think that meant cooler
criss<00:03:48.110> cross<00:03:48.350> piece
