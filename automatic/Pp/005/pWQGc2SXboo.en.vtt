00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
see it right here over here there is the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.590 
see it right here over here there is the
culprit<00:03:00.710> right<00:03:01.040> there<00:03:01.120> there's<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.180> hole<00:03:02.360> in

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
culprit right there there's a hole in

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.890 
culprit right there there's a hole in
that<00:03:02.630> soft<00:03:03.110> plug<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.590> when<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.860> blew<00:03:04.160> out

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
that soft plug and when that blew out

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.410 
that soft plug and when that blew out
yet<00:03:05.900> spewed<00:03:06.380> antifreeze<00:03:06.890> everywhere<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
yet spewed antifreeze everywhere and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.220 
yet spewed antifreeze everywhere and
that<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:09.080> is<00:03:09.590> actually<00:03:10.480> right<00:03:11.480> back<00:03:11.930> up

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
that one is actually right back up

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.450 
that one is actually right back up
against<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:13.280> firewall<00:03:13.550> right<00:03:14.420> there<00:03:15.460> making

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
against the firewall right there making

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.720 
against the firewall right there making
it<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.970> could<00:03:17.300> not<00:03:17.450> get<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.990> it<00:03:18.700> now<00:03:19.700> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
it so that I could not get to it now you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.410 
it so that I could not get to it now you
can<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:20.000> my<00:03:20.330> dilemma<00:03:20.720> down<00:03:21.050> there<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:22.430> bell

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
can see my dilemma down there the bell

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.240 
can see my dilemma down there the bell
housing<00:03:23.660> actually<00:03:24.170> wraps<00:03:24.710> around<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
housing actually wraps around the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.860 
housing actually wraps around the
flywheel<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.120> got<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.360> take<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.630> clutch

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
flywheel so you got to take the clutch

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.560 
flywheel so you got to take the clutch
and<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.230> flywheel<00:03:27.260> off<00:03:27.920> in<00:03:28.730> order<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.240> get<00:03:29.360> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
and the flywheel off in order to get the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.870 
and the flywheel off in order to get the
motor<00:03:29.720> out<00:03:30.040> which<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> pain<00:03:31.490> in<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.700> butt<00:03:31.850> to

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
motor out which is a pain in the butt to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.070 
motor out which is a pain in the butt to
say<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.240> very<00:03:32.360> least

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
say the very least

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.190 
say the very least
but<00:03:34.150> excellent<00:03:35.150> design<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:35.810> any<00:03:35.930> time

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
but excellent design because any time

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.860 
but excellent design because any time
you<00:03:36.320> need<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.560> swap<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.830> clutch<00:03:37.220> all<00:03:38.180> you've<00:03:38.630> got

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
you need to swap a clutch all you've got

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.470 
you need to swap a clutch all you've got
to<00:03:38.990> do<00:03:39.110> is<00:03:39.350> just<00:03:40.250> pull<00:03:40.490> for<00:03:40.880> both<00:03:41.060> side<00:03:41.300> of<00:03:41.330> the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
to do is just pull for both side of the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.510 
to do is just pull for both side of the
transmission<00:03:41.870> drop<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.830> back<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.490> can

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
transmission drop it back and you can

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.960 
transmission drop it back and you can
drop<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.970> clutch<00:03:44.320> right<00:03:45.320> out<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.680> bottom

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
drop the clutch right out the bottom

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.540 
drop the clutch right out the bottom
that's<00:03:47.170> pretty<00:03:48.170> ingenious<00:03:48.380> engineering<00:03:49.010> if

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
that's pretty ingenious engineering if

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.920 
that's pretty ingenious engineering if
you<00:03:49.670> ask<00:03:49.820> me<00:03:50.090> because<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.390> clutch<00:03:50.600> is<00:03:50.750> gonna

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
you ask me because the clutch is gonna

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.590 
you ask me because the clutch is gonna
come<00:03:51.110> out<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> lot<00:03:51.500> more<00:03:51.680> times<00:03:51.980> than<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.220> motor

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
come out a lot more times than a motor

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.590 
come out a lot more times than a motor
at<00:03:53.600> least<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:55.040> should<00:03:55.510> but<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:57.500> now<00:03:58.420> we<00:03:59.420> get

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
at least it should but for now we get

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.350 
at least it should but for now we get
the<00:03:59.750> motor<00:03:59.960> out<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.820> we're<00:04:01.820> gonna<00:04:01.880> work<00:04:02.180> on

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
the motor out and we're gonna work on

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.720 
the motor out and we're gonna work on
getting<00:04:02.390> everything<00:04:02.870> back<00:04:03.050> or<00:04:03.710> we're<00:04:04.610> gonna

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
getting everything back or we're gonna

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.820 
getting everything back or we're gonna
work<00:04:04.850> on<00:04:05.030> getting<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.330> plug<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.930> there<00:04:06.140> then

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
work on getting that plug in there then

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.810 
work on getting that plug in there then
work<00:04:07.100> they're<00:04:07.310> going<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.490> work<00:04:07.580> on<00:04:07.760> getting

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
work they're going to work on getting
