00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
video for today is about scales and

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.150 
video for today is about scales and
scaled<00:01:01.780> is<00:01:01.870> something<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.350> no<00:01:02.649> matter<00:01:02.800> your

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
scaled is something that no matter your

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.389 
scaled is something that no matter your
level<00:01:03.309> or<00:01:03.700> what<00:01:04.119> kind<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.619> style<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.740> play<00:01:05.920> you

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
level or what kind of style you play you

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.850 
level or what kind of style you play you
always<00:01:06.640> have<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.940> kind<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.149> deal<00:01:07.330> with<00:01:07.420> scales

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
always have to kind of deal with scales

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.780 
always have to kind of deal with scales
in<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:08.950> beginning<00:01:09.250> because<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.520> have<00:01:09.670> to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
in the beginning because you have to

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.219 
in the beginning because you have to
memorize<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:10.149> lot<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.540> them<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:10.960> learn<00:01:11.050> how<00:01:11.200> to

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
memorize a lot of them you learn how to

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.620 
memorize a lot of them you learn how to
play<00:01:11.440> them<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.100> increase<00:01:12.369> your<00:01:12.640> technique

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
play them and increase your technique

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.340 
play them and increase your technique
your<00:01:13.930> your<00:01:15.570> coordination<00:01:16.570> with<00:01:16.840> them<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.229> all

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
your your coordination with them and all

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.350 
your your coordination with them and all
this<00:01:17.470> stuff<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.220> then<00:01:18.399> when<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.330> a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
this stuff and then when you get to a

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.850 
this stuff and then when you get to a
more<00:01:19.600> advanced<00:01:20.020> level<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.470> still<00:01:20.650> kind<00:01:20.830> of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
more advanced level you still kind of

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.109 
more advanced level you still kind of
have<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.130> worry<00:01:21.310> about<00:01:21.460> them<00:01:21.760> because<00:01:22.000> they're

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
have to worry about them because they're

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.719 
have to worry about them because they're
still<00:01:22.330> pretty<00:01:22.510> good<00:01:22.690> for<00:01:23.250> form<00:01:24.250> enough<00:01:24.520> I

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
still pretty good for form enough I

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.850 
still pretty good for form enough I
don't<00:01:25.540> usually<00:01:25.630> play<00:01:25.869> scales<00:01:26.200> but<00:01:26.409> warm<00:01:26.680> up

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
don't usually play scales but warm up

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.310 
don't usually play scales but warm up
exercises<00:01:27.760> usually<00:01:28.270> kind<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.659> evolve<00:01:29.170> around

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
exercises usually kind of evolve around

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.490 
exercises usually kind of evolve around
them<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:31.049> there's<00:01:32.049> a<00:01:32.140> long<00:01:32.229> as<00:01:32.409> you're

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
them and so there's a long as you're

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.600 
them and so there's a long as you're
playing<00:01:32.680> that<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:32.920> might<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.250> well<00:01:33.369> try<00:01:33.549> to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
playing that you might as well try to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.399 
playing that you might as well try to
figure<00:01:33.820> out<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:34.030> way<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.270> make<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:35.110> make<00:01:35.260> them

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
figure out a way to make it to make them

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.490 
figure out a way to make it to make them
you<00:01:35.830> know<00:01:35.920> useful<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.580> musically<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.500> so

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
you know useful so musically and so

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.620 
you know useful so musically and so
here's<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.860> idea<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.909> will<00:01:40.119> kind<00:01:40.479> of

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
here's the idea and this will kind of

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.350 
here's the idea and this will kind of
screw<00:01:41.140> up<00:01:41.470> your<00:01:41.770> head<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.700> think<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.180> know

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
screw up your head you think you know

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.580 
screw up your head you think you know
the<00:01:43.510> scales<00:01:43.780> as<00:01:44.049> a<00:01:44.110> matter<00:01:44.259> of<00:01:44.320> fact<00:01:44.470> we're

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
the scales as a matter of fact we're

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.380 
the scales as a matter of fact we're
gonna<00:01:44.680> do<00:01:44.860> any<00:01:45.040> C<00:01:45.220> major<00:01:45.400> in<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.909> very<00:01:46.119> simple

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
gonna do any C major in a very simple

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.749 
gonna do any C major in a very simple
position<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.950> kind<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.189> figure<00:01:48.400> out<00:01:48.520> that

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
position but you kind of figure out that

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.670 
position but you kind of figure out that
what<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.570> thought<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.960> know<00:01:50.110> maybe<00:01:50.500> you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
what you thought you know maybe you

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.710 
what you thought you know maybe you
don't<00:01:50.710> know<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:51.220> well<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:52.270> I'm<00:01:52.360> sure<00:01:52.509> some<00:01:52.689> of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
don't know so well and I'm sure some of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.450 
don't know so well and I'm sure some of
you<00:01:52.900> will<00:01:53.080> kind<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.040> blow<00:01:54.159> through<00:01:54.369> this

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
you will kind of blow through this

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.219 
you will kind of blow through this
exercise<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.330> real<00:01:55.540> easy<00:01:55.720> but<00:01:55.930> for<00:01:56.200> a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
exercise and it's real easy but for a

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.890 
exercise and it's real easy but for a
lot<00:01:56.409> of<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:56.860> think<00:01:57.250> you'll<00:01:57.490> find<00:01:57.900> the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
lot of you I think you'll find the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.810 
lot of you I think you'll find the
coordination<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.650> be<00:01:59.740> quite<00:02:00.009> complex<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.700> the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
coordination to be quite complex so the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.130 
coordination to be quite complex so the
basic<00:02:01.090> idea<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.689> bring<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.960> whole

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
basic idea is that you bring the whole

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.680 
basic idea is that you bring the whole
scale

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.690 

and<00:02:08.899> once<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.020> play<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.890> way<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.520> go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and once you play all the way up you go

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
and once you play all the way up you go
back<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.390> start<00:02:12.450> from<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.960> next<00:02:13.140> notes

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
back and you start from the next notes

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.310 
back and you start from the next notes
so<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.100> play<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.940> example<00:02:15.240> from<00:02:15.480> C<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:19.140> go

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
so you play for example from C you go

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.900 
so you play for example from C you go
all<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.980> way<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.370> last<00:02:20.520> note<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
all the way up the last note of the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.400 
all the way up the last note of the
position<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.570> right<00:02:22.050> away<00:02:22.230> without

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
position and then right away without

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.710 
position and then right away without
stopping<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.280> move<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.390> second

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
stopping you move back to the second

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:39.440 
stopping you move back to the second
note<00:02:36.260> right<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.740> on<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> closer

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
note right and so on and I have a closer

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.810 
note right and so on and I have a closer
in<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.960> second<00:02:40.320> until<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> point

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
in a second until you get to the point

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.190 
in a second until you get to the point
where<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.090> don't<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.390> any<00:02:42.600> more<00:02:42.780> notes<00:02:42.990> left

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
where you don't have any more notes left

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.860 
where you don't have any more notes left
and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.920> do<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.070> backwards<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.870> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and then you can do it backwards and the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.270 
and then you can do it backwards and the
difficult<00:02:46.440> thing<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.860> your<00:02:46.980> brain<00:02:47.250> is

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
difficult thing is that your brain is

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
difficult thing is that your brain is
probably<00:02:47.670> used<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.030> practicing<00:02:48.720> scales<00:02:48.930> from

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
probably used to practicing scales from

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460 
probably used to practicing scales from
the<00:02:49.800> low<00:02:50.100> string<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.330> highest<00:02:51.660> or<00:02:51.780> for

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the low string to the highest or for

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130 
the low string to the highest or for
vice-versa<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.360> still<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.630> very<00:02:54.660> linear

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
vice-versa but still in a very linear

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.570 
vice-versa but still in a very linear
way<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:55.890> from<00:02:56.100> there<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.400> kind<00:02:56.490> of

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
way and then from there it kind of

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.790 
way and then from there it kind of
breaks<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.240> when<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> improvise<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.680> go

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
breaks up when you improvise and you go

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.590 
breaks up when you improvise and you go
like<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.310> all<00:02:59.550> over<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.760> place<00:02:59.850> but

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
like you know all over the place but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.430 
like you know all over the place but
there's<00:03:00.810> nothing<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.110> between

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
there's nothing in between

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.530 
there's nothing in between
so<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.700> would<00:03:02.850> really<00:03:03.060> make<00:03:03.209> your<00:03:03.330> brain

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
so this would really make your brain

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.180 
so this would really make your brain
think<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.959> lot<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.740> see<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.160> that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
think a lot and what you see is that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.880 
think a lot and what you see is that
when<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> start<00:03:05.940> from<00:03:06.090> different<00:03:06.510> notes<00:03:06.890> you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
when you start from different notes you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.350 
when you start from different notes you
in<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.190> strange<00:03:08.459> way<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.760> start<00:03:09.150> playing

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
in a strange way you start playing

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.150 
in a strange way you start playing
different<00:03:09.720> scales<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.739> they<00:03:10.890> will<00:03:11.040> kind

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
different scales because they will kind

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.990 
different scales because they will kind
of<00:03:11.250> fit<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:12.709> pattern<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.489> particular

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
of fit the pattern of that particular

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600 
of fit the pattern of that particular
string<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.200> see<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:16.980> hard<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.370> explain

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
string and you see it's hard to explain

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.220 
string and you see it's hard to explain
them<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.390> when<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.989> see

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
them to do it so when you do it you see

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.590 
them to do it so when you do it you see
the<00:03:19.320> mistake<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.800> make<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.330> it's<00:03:21.330> really

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
the mistake you make and it's really

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.720 
the mistake you make and it's really
really<00:03:21.989> useful<00:03:22.140> because<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.310> will<00:03:23.459> free

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
really useful because then it will free

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.180 
really useful because then it will free
you<00:03:23.940> from<00:03:24.110> from<00:03:25.110> having<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.620> visualize

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
you from from having to visualize

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.759 
you from from having to visualize
complete<00:03:26.970> patterns<00:03:27.420> on<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.840> fretboard<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:28.500> if

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
complete patterns on the fretboard so if

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.770 
complete patterns on the fretboard so if
you're<00:03:28.890> improvising<00:03:29.160> or<00:03:29.580> composing<00:03:30.120> you

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
you're improvising or composing you

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.860 
you're improvising or composing you
don't<00:03:30.959> have<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.290> look<00:03:32.280> at<00:03:32.430> notes<00:03:32.640> as<00:03:32.880> part<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.480> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
don't have to look at notes as part of a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.479 
don't have to look at notes as part of a
pattern<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.769> actually<00:03:34.920> just<00:03:35.280> play

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
pattern you can actually just play

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.150 
pattern you can actually just play
through<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.000> notes<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.650> you're<00:03:37.650> free<00:03:37.920> of

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
through the notes and you're free of

so<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.140> very<00:03:46.230> useful<00:03:46.470> I've<00:03:47.190> been<00:03:47.370> doing<00:03:47.550> this

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
so it's very useful I've been doing this

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.940 
so it's very useful I've been doing this
I<00:03:47.850> used<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.570> do<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.780> actually<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.230> few<00:03:49.590> years<00:03:49.830> ago

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
I used to do it actually a few years ago

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.699 
I used to do it actually a few years ago
many<00:03:50.670> years<00:03:50.880> ago<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.050> really<00:03:52.200> was<00:03:52.440> an

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
many years ago and it really was an

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.580 
many years ago and it really was an
important<00:03:53.400> step<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.080> free

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
important step in to you know to free

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.220 
important step in to you know to free
myself<00:03:55.769> from<00:03:56.100> all<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.480> parent<00:03:58.050> like

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
myself from all the parent like

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.610 
myself from all the parent like
structures<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:59.010> scales<00:03:59.670> okay<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.989> let<00:04:01.260> me<00:04:01.290> show

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
structures of scales okay so let me show

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.759 
structures of scales okay so let me show
it<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:01.890> from<00:04:02.010> close<00:04:02.190> up<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.870> we'll<00:04:03.870> go

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
it to you from close up and we'll go

00:04:04.769 --> 00:05:01.810 
it to you from close up and we'll go
very<00:04:05.100> slow<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.790> see<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> whole<00:04:06.360> thing

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.030 

so<00:05:02.820> that's<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.090> exercise<00:05:03.410> as<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.530> said<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:04.860> very

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
so that's the exercise as I said is very

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.370 
so that's the exercise as I said is very
useful<00:05:05.370> for<00:05:05.660> breaking<00:05:06.660> up<00:05:06.780> your<00:05:06.990> your

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
useful for breaking up your your

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.000 
useful for breaking up your your
patterns<00:05:07.950> of<00:05:08.540> scale<00:05:09.540> playing<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.860> can

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
patterns of scale playing and you can

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.500 
patterns of scale playing and you can
find<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.310> very<00:05:11.340> useful<00:05:11.490> when<00:05:11.910> improvising

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
find it very useful when improvising

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.750 
find it very useful when improvising
will<00:05:12.660> really<00:05:12.990> free<00:05:13.230> you<00:05:13.380> from<00:05:13.920> from<00:05:14.370> patterns

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
will really free you from from patterns

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.310 
will really free you from from patterns
the<00:05:15.090> thing<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.450> have<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.720> apply<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:15.960> to

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
the thing is you have to apply this to

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.890 
the thing is you have to apply this to
all<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.500> patterns<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.040> know<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.580> then<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:18.270> did

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
all the patterns you know and then I did

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.360 
all the patterns you know and then I did
it<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.110> C<00:05:19.320> major<00:05:19.470> because<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.890> wanted<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.160> show

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
it in C major because I wanted to show

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.910 
it in C major because I wanted to show
you<00:05:20.400> that<00:05:20.610> no<00:05:20.760> matter<00:05:20.880> how<00:05:21.090> simple<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.600> scale

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
you that no matter how simple the scale

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.410 
you that no matter how simple the scale
it<00:05:22.920> can<00:05:23.100> get<00:05:23.190> very<00:05:23.430> complicated<00:05:23.790> when<00:05:24.300> you

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
it can get very complicated when you

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.990 
it can get very complicated when you
start<00:05:24.470> messing<00:05:25.470> around<00:05:25.770> with<00:05:26.040> with<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.970> know

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
start messing around with with you know

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.360 
start messing around with with you know
with<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.230> patterns<00:05:28.230> in<00:05:28.320> your<00:05:28.440> head<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:29.220> then

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
with the patterns in your head but then

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.130 
with the patterns in your head but then
you<00:05:29.490> can<00:05:29.640> of<00:05:29.730> course<00:05:29.760> move<00:05:30.180> into<00:05:30.390> more<00:05:30.690> complex

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
you can of course move into more complex

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.810 
you can of course move into more complex
scales<00:05:31.530> with<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:32.040> lot<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.250> sharps<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.640> lot<00:05:32.730> of

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
scales with a lot of sharps a lot of

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.500 
scales with a lot of sharps a lot of
flats<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.750> can<00:05:33.900> move<00:05:34.050> two<00:05:34.200> modes

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
flats and you can move two modes

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.270 
flats and you can move two modes
harmonic<00:05:36.510> minor<00:05:36.600> melodic<00:05:36.990> minors<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:38.130> mini

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
harmonic minor melodic minors the mini

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.890 
harmonic minor melodic minors the mini
scales<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.910> so<00:05:39.090> on<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.420> can<00:05:39.570> do<00:05:39.660> it<00:05:39.780> with

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
scales and so on you can do it with

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.320 
scales and so on you can do it with
anything<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.430> see<00:05:41.640> that<00:05:41.820> it's<00:05:41.940> it's

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
anything and you see that it's it's

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.080 
anything and you see that it's it's
really<00:05:42.990> useful<00:05:43.290> alright<00:05:43.710> so<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.490> see<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.820> next

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
really useful alright so I see you next
