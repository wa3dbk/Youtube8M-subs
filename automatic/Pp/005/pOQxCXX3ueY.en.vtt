talk to him today about hypertrophy max
and<00:00:20.970> face<00:00:21.359> point<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> program<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.650> had<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and face point of the program I had a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.009 
and face point of the program I had a
specific<00:00:23.430> question<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.300> focusing<00:00:24.810> on

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
specific question it's focusing on

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
specific question it's focusing on
tension<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> wanted<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> ask<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> lot

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
tension then I wanted to ask you a lot

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
tension then I wanted to ask you a lot
of<00:00:27.300> guys<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.630> noticed<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.170> gym<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:29.070> don't

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of guys I noticed that gym they don't

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.830 
of guys I noticed that gym they don't
have<00:00:29.609> full<00:00:29.849> range<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.150> motion<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.689> them

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
have full range of motion I see them

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.479 
have full range of motion I see them
cutting<00:00:31.050> short<00:00:31.199> even<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.619> bicep<00:00:32.070> curls<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
cutting short even on bicep curls it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.040 
cutting short even on bicep curls it
seems<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.149> don't<00:00:33.180> extend<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.899> way

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
seems like they don't extend all the way

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.319 
seems like they don't extend all the way
down<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.399> almost<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.120> set

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
down and it's almost like you set

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
down and it's almost like you set
yourself<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.899> injury<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.500> you're<00:00:37.649> not

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
yourself up for injury if you're not

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860 
yourself up for injury if you're not
working<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.670> fault<00:00:38.940> muscle<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.660> know

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
working the fault muscle I know

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.180 
working the fault muscle I know
attention<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> seems<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.829> you're<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:40.980> of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
attention it seems like you're kind of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
attention it seems like you're kind of
resetting<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.840> explain

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
resetting it a little bit you explain

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190 
resetting it a little bit you explain
that<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.510> Vince<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.719> decided<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that right so Vince and I decided to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.810 
that right so Vince and I decided to
sign<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.739> program<00:00:47.100> actually<00:00:47.250> took<00:00:47.520> us<00:00:47.640> about

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
sign this program actually took us about

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
sign this program actually took us about
12<00:00:48.090> months<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> making<00:00:48.780> designs<00:00:49.440> program

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
12 months in the making designs program

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.439 
12 months in the making designs program
because<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:50.910> wanted<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> take<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
because we really wanted to take a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
because we really wanted to take a
logical<00:00:52.079> approach<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:52.920> didn't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
logical approach we really just didn't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
logical approach we really just didn't
want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> throw<00:00:53.579> something<00:00:53.850> together<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
want to throw something together and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
want to throw something together and
hopefully<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.070> didn't<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
hopefully or it didn't you know maybe it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.660 
hopefully or it didn't you know maybe it
did<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:56.969> didn't<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:58.579> obviously<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
did maybe didn't so which obviously we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.069 
did maybe didn't so which obviously we
wanted<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> best<00:01:00.359> possible<00:01:00.539> program

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
wanted to be the best possible program

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
wanted to be the best possible program
so<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> look<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> most

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so we want to look at what was the most

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.469 
so we want to look at what was the most
glaring<00:01:03.780> issue<00:01:04.680> wholly<00:01:05.189> beautified<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.360> as

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
glaring issue wholly beautified so as

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.660 
glaring issue wholly beautified so as
mike<00:01:06.659> says<00:01:06.960> range<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> motion<00:01:08.070> most<00:01:08.369> people

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
mike says range of motion most people

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.429 
mike says range of motion most people
won't<00:01:09.180> either<00:01:09.420> don't<00:01:09.720> use<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> proper<00:01:10.200> range

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
won't either don't use the proper range

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
won't either don't use the proper range
of<00:01:10.530> motion<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> floor<00:01:11.340> brother<00:01:11.640> tend<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> use

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of motion to floor brother tend to use

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
of motion to floor brother tend to use
the<00:01:12.869> range<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> motion<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the range of motion that you need to to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
the range of motion that you need to to
recruit<00:01:14.400> muscle<00:01:14.729> prime<00:01:15.299> example<00:01:15.750> being<00:01:15.930> lower

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
recruit muscle prime example being lower

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.260 
recruit muscle prime example being lower
back<00:01:16.500> hamstrings<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> flexibility<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.909> well

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
back hamstrings in flexibility like well

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
back hamstrings in flexibility like well
why<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:18.930> these<00:01:19.049> people<00:01:19.200> using<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> smaller

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
why are these people using a smaller

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
why are these people using a smaller
range<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.159> motion<00:01:20.250> maybe<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
range of motion maybe they can so if is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.060 
range of motion maybe they can so if is
there<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> way<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.650> fix<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
there a way where we can fix it and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
there a way where we can fix it and
teach<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.640> how<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.869> move<00:01:24.869> their<00:01:25.020> muscles

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
teach them how to move their muscles

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.990 
teach them how to move their muscles
move<00:01:25.650> their<00:01:25.860> body<00:01:26.040> probably<00:01:26.310> include<00:01:26.850> their

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
move their body probably include their

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.990 
move their body probably include their
muscles<00:01:27.270> properly<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> max<00:01:28.950> tension<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
muscles properly so max tension is the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
muscles properly so max tension is the
first<00:01:30.240> month<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.670> teaching

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
first month it's really about teaching

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330 
first month it's really about teaching
your<00:01:32.970> body<00:01:33.079> new<00:01:34.079> mobile<00:01:34.530> movement<00:01:34.979> patek<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
your body new mobile movement patek you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
your body new mobile movement patek you
motor<00:01:35.579> patterns<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.210> brain<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.659> we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
motor patterns in your brain so we

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.039 
motor patterns in your brain so we
really<00:01:37.079> try<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.729> break<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> month<00:01:39.479> into

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
really try to break up the month into

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.499 
really try to break up the month into
addressing<00:01:40.950> specific<00:01:41.790> movement<00:01:42.180> pattern

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
addressing specific movement pattern

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
addressing specific movement pattern
deficits<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.710> sounds<00:01:43.979> complicated<00:01:44.280> but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
deficits which sounds complicated but

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.899 
deficits which sounds complicated but
really<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> few<00:01:45.810> basic<00:01:46.229> things<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
really it's a few basic things that

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.639 
really it's a few basic things that
average<00:01:47.909> people<00:01:48.119> can't<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> gym<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.530> we

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
average people can't do in the gym so we

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
average people can't do in the gym so we
wanted<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> reassess<00:01:50.659> movements<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:52.079> do

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
wanted to reassess movements and how do

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
wanted to reassess movements and how do
you<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.710> body<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.220> brain<00:01:53.460> learn<00:01:54.390> how<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
you your body in your brain learn how to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.840 
you your body in your brain learn how to
move<00:01:54.869> properly<00:01:55.110> through<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> floor

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
move properly through a floor

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.640 
move properly through a floor
while<00:01:57.090> optimizing<00:01:57.420> attention<00:01:58.229> people<00:01:58.500> don't

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
while optimizing attention people don't

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.780 
while optimizing attention people don't
really<00:01:58.770> understand<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.220> attention<00:01:59.580> means

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
really understand what attention means

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
really understand what attention means
it's<00:02:00.270> kind<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> proverbial<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:01.979> my

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it's kind of the proverbial you know my

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.249 
it's kind of the proverbial you know my
muscle<00:02:02.490> connection<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.939> hear<00:02:03.150> about<00:02:03.330> so

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
muscle connection you hear about so

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
muscle connection you hear about so
really<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.740> about<00:02:04.770> teaching<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.700> new

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
really it was about teaching you new

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.620 
really it was about teaching you new
movement<00:02:06.899> patterns<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> retraining<00:02:07.979> these

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
movement patterns and retraining these

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.330 
movement patterns and retraining these
to<00:02:09.630> kind<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> break<00:02:10.200> old<00:02:10.380> movement<00:02:10.739> matters<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to kind of break old movement matters so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.540 
to kind of break old movement matters so
a<00:02:11.610> lot<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.540> stuff<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.840> unilateral<00:02:13.459> really<00:02:14.459> is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
a lot of stuff is unilateral really is

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.170 
a lot of stuff is unilateral really is
trying<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.940> open<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.390> fascial<00:02:16.200> restrictions

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
trying to open up fascial restrictions

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.699 
trying to open up fascial restrictions
train<00:02:18.180> your<00:02:18.360> brain<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.989> these<00:02:19.260> movements

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
train your brain so that these movements

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.500 
train your brain so that these movements
are<00:02:19.770> natural<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.280> easy<00:02:20.370> again<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.970> lot<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
are natural and easy again a lot of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.790 
are natural and easy again a lot of
people<00:02:21.720> just<00:02:21.870> really<00:02:22.140> can't<00:02:22.290> do<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.709> know

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
people just really can't do it you know

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.770 
people just really can't do it you know
so<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.069> think<00:02:23.670> prime<00:02:24.000> example<00:02:24.420> being<00:02:24.569> dead

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
so I think prime example being dead

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.089 
so I think prime example being dead
lifts<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.140> often<00:02:25.349> people<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.830> happens

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
lifts and often people have that happens

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.220 
lifts and often people have that happens
through<00:02:26.250> your<00:02:26.370> back<00:02:26.519> in<00:02:27.150> flexibility<00:02:27.900> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
through your back in flexibility so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
through your back in flexibility so
you're<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.530> getting<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> proper<00:02:28.980> range<00:02:29.370> in

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you're not getting a proper range in

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.570 
you're not getting a proper range in
your<00:02:29.850> hamstrings<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.470> we've<00:02:31.980> done<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.459> we

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
your hamstrings so we've done that we

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.509 
your hamstrings so we've done that we
decide<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.970> program<00:02:33.269> specifically<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.519> open

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
decide the program specifically to open

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.979 
decide the program specifically to open
up<00:02:35.610> these<00:02:35.730> range<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.090> emotions<00:02:36.540> open<00:02:36.780> up<00:02:36.870> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
up these range of emotions open up that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.840 
up these range of emotions open up that
fashion<00:02:37.380> little<00:02:37.560> special<00:02:37.920> reasons<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
fashion little special reasons the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.059 
fashion little special reasons the
workouts<00:02:39.239> extremely<00:02:40.019> difficult<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.950> it's

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
workouts extremely difficult but it's

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.970 
workouts extremely difficult but it's
extremely<00:02:41.519> specific<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.319> Vince<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
extremely specific so you know Vince and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.320 
extremely specific so you know Vince and
I<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.370> extensive<00:02:44.730> background<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
I have a really extensive background you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.360 
I have a really extensive background you
know<00:02:45.420> I've<00:02:45.510> studied<00:02:45.720> biomechanics<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.560> 15

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
know I've studied biomechanics for 15

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.100 
know I've studied biomechanics for 15
years<00:02:47.580> including<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.269> degree<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.840> so

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
years including a degree in it so

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.920 
years including a degree in it so
learning<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.280> open<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.150> these<00:02:51.269> these<00:02:51.600> ranges

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
learning to open up these these ranges

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.509 
learning to open up these these ranges
emotions<00:02:52.380> about<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.739> range<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.040> motion<00:02:53.280> are

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
emotions about the range of motion are

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.220 
emotions about the range of motion are
things<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.819> people<00:02:54.090> neglect<00:02:54.269> typically

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
things that people neglect typically

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.720 
things that people neglect typically
people<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.890> gym<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.459> your<00:02:56.580> basic

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
people will get the gym to do your basic

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.059 
people will get the gym to do your basic
squats<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.299> deadlifts<00:02:57.569> or<00:02:57.720> bench<00:02:57.900> presses<00:02:58.290> but

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
squats or deadlifts or bench presses but

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.610 
squats or deadlifts or bench presses but
they<00:02:59.190> don't<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.819> very<00:03:00.329> movement<00:03:00.840> patterns<00:03:01.380> so

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
they don't do very movement patterns so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.840 
they don't do very movement patterns so
that<00:03:01.769> your<00:03:01.890> body<00:03:02.070> your<00:03:02.220> body's<00:03:02.430> designed<00:03:02.760> to

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
that your body your body's designed to

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.699 
that your body your body's designed to
work<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.209> millions<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.959> different<00:03:04.290> movement

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
work and millions of different movement

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.620 
work and millions of different movement
of<00:03:04.799> planes<00:03:05.070> right<00:03:05.459> not<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.239> meant<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.480> work

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
of planes right not just meant to work

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.150 
of planes right not just meant to work
like<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.019> it's<00:03:07.530> meant<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.739> work<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:08.040> all

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
like this it's meant to work in all

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.920 
like this it's meant to work in all
different<00:03:08.340> types<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:09.000> planes<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.390> we<00:03:09.510> don't

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
different types of planes and we don't

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.810 
different types of planes and we don't
train<00:03:10.260> those<00:03:10.440> because<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.799> those<00:03:10.950> plans<00:03:11.250> you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
train those because of those plans you

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.039 
train those because of those plans you
buy<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> other<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:12.690> used<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> get

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
buy this and other it's not used to get

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.330 
buy this and other it's not used to get
very<00:03:13.140> weak<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.590> those<00:03:13.709> planes<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.160> when<00:03:14.250> you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
very weak in those planes so when you

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.130 
very weak in those planes so when you
ask<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:14.940> there<00:03:15.180> especially<00:03:15.930> where<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
ask it to go there especially where the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.990 
ask it to go there especially where the
weight<00:03:16.340> doesn't<00:03:17.340> happen<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.760> what<00:03:17.850> we're

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
weight doesn't happen so what we're

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 
weight doesn't happen so what we're
really<00:03:18.030> doing<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.600> focusing<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.230> creating

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
really doing is focusing on creating

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.530 
really doing is focusing on creating
tension<00:03:20.430> at<00:03:20.519> those<00:03:20.640> extremes<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.329> range

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
tension at those extremes of the range

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.090 
tension at those extremes of the range
so<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.350> your<00:03:22.470> body<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.739> actually

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
so that your body can actually

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.650 
so that your body can actually
understand<00:03:23.549> hey<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> need<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.000> be<00:03:24.150> strong<00:03:24.450> here

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
understand hey I need to be strong here

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.220 
understand hey I need to be strong here
too

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
too

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.380 
too
and<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.890> essentially<00:03:26.340> rebalancing<00:03:27.269> your

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
and it's essentially rebalancing your

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.729 
and it's essentially rebalancing your
body<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.810> teaching<00:03:28.109> your<00:03:28.170> body<00:03:28.260> got<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.650> move

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
body and teaching your body got to move

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.410 
body and teaching your body got to move
properly<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.549> almost<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.880> grinding<00:03:30.359> your

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
properly it's almost like grinding your

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.610 
properly it's almost like grinding your
body<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.079> that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
body so that

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.170 
body so that
as<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.890> robotics<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.459> other<00:03:32.610> basis<00:03:33.030> after

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
as in robotics the other basis after

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.790 
as in robotics the other basis after
Hooters<00:03:33.569> do<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:33.959> potential<00:03:34.319> for<00:03:34.650> more

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
Hooters do you have potential for more

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.199 
Hooters do you have potential for more
muscle<00:03:35.160> literally<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.790> mean<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.090> you're

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
muscle literally I mean if you're

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.790 
muscle literally I mean if you're
staying<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:36.870> range<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.319> motion<00:03:37.650> and

staying in this one range of motion and
just<00:03:37.890> working<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.489> you're<00:03:38.910> not<00:03:39.030> working<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
just working then you're not working the

just working then you're not working the
other<00:03:39.599> ranges<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.200> it's<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.440> safe<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.830> be<00:03:40.860> in

those ranges of load they'll tell you

those ranges of load they'll tell you
until<00:03:43.379> you<00:03:43.560> break<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.920> up<00:03:45.080> that's<00:03:46.080> all<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.290> a

until you break this up that's all it a

what<00:03:53.760> happens<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.390> day<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.599> happened

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
what happens if that one day it happened

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.009 
what happens if that one day it happened
to<00:03:54.900> go<00:03:55.019> back<00:03:55.200> here<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.510> what<00:03:57.510> we're<00:03:57.690> doing<00:03:57.720> is

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
to go back here so what we're doing is

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.830 
to go back here so what we're doing is
we're<00:03:58.200> slowly<00:03:58.739> Trinity<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.310> body<00:03:59.519> back<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.810> a

so<00:04:04.709> many<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:05.130> would<00:04:05.250> never<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.610> about

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
so many that you would never think about

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.759 
so many that you would never think about
you<00:04:06.000> know<00:04:06.090> fully<00:04:06.360> lengthening<00:04:06.780> fly<00:04:07.049> set<00:04:07.319> plug

people kept you in for length and advice
that<00:04:09.150> we're<00:04:09.450> trying<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:09.720> foil<00:04:09.930> like<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:10.319> but

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
that we're trying to foil like this but

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.140 
that we're trying to foil like this but
believe<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.190> or<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.370> but<00:04:11.700> most<00:04:11.880> people<00:04:12.060> may

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
believe it or not but most people may

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.370 
believe it or not but most people may
think<00:04:12.209> they're<00:04:12.480> positive<00:04:12.870> fuller<00:04:13.019> lengthen

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
think they're positive fuller lengthen

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.720 
think they're positive fuller lengthen
but<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> lot<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:13.920> actually<00:04:14.040> happening<00:04:14.459> at

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
but a lot of it's actually happening at

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.699 
but a lot of it's actually happening at
a<00:04:14.760> pelvic<00:04:15.120> rotation<00:04:15.630> but<00:04:16.109> they're<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:16.380> fact

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
a pelvic rotation but they're in fact

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.140 
a pelvic rotation but they're in fact
not<00:04:17.040> extending<00:04:17.489> your<00:04:17.579> quad<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.790> there's<00:04:18.030> so

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
not extending your quad and there's so

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.509 
not extending your quad and there's so
many<00:04:18.209> things<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.919> really<00:04:20.190> don't<00:04:20.310> even

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
many things that you really don't even

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.979 
many things that you really don't even
realize<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:20.880> you're<00:04:21.150> not<00:04:21.239> doing<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.780> we're

realize that you're not doing that we're

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.920 
realize that you're not doing that we're

and enjoy you know see that I mean
there's<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:37.889> much<00:04:38.039> more<00:04:38.460> range<00:04:38.760> than<00:04:38.910> people

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
there's so much more range than people

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.760 
there's so much more range than people
can<00:04:39.539> be<00:04:39.690> getting<00:04:39.930> out<00:04:40.050> they<00:04:40.169> can<00:04:40.380> go<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.590> those

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
can be getting out they can go to those

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.370 
can be getting out they can go to those
extremes<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:42.180> range<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.630> motion

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
extremes but the range of motion

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.860 
extremes but the range of motion
actually<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.740> lot<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.370> people<00:04:44.580> don't<00:04:44.670> see<00:04:44.870> don't

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
actually a lot of people don't see don't

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.120 
actually a lot of people don't see don't
really<00:04:46.020> understand<00:04:46.320> well<00:04:46.470> okay<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:46.980> is<00:04:47.100> a

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
really understand well okay this is a

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.610 
really understand well okay this is a
range<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.490> motion<00:04:47.790> for<00:04:47.940> apply<00:04:48.210> set<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:49.320> what<00:04:49.500> is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
range of motion for apply set so what is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.930 
range of motion for apply set so what is
it<00:04:49.710> really<00:04:49.890> matter<00:04:50.070> why<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.550> need<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.790> take

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
it really matter why do I need to take

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.520 
it really matter why do I need to take
you<00:04:51.030> through<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:51.330> range<00:04:51.570> well<00:04:51.870> it's

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
you through that range well it's

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.810 
you through that range well it's
ultimately<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:52.980> comes<00:04:53.070> down<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> strength

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
ultimately it comes down to the strength

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.860 
ultimately it comes down to the strength
curve<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.420> is<00:04:54.570> really<00:04:54.780> really

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
curve and this is really really

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.090 
curve and this is really really
applicable<00:04:55.260> in<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.590> first<00:04:55.800> month<00:04:56.010> of

Remax<00:04:58.170> program<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.310> even<00:04:59.430> get<00:04:59.610> strong<00:05:00.030> the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
Remax program is you even get strong the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.630 
Remax program is you even get strong the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
extremes of range you propotional ii get

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.770 
extremes of range you propotional ii get
stronger<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> middle<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.510> muscle

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
stronger in the middle and the muscle

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.880 
stronger in the middle and the muscle
will<00:05:03.870> become<00:05:04.080> fully<00:05:04.290> developed<00:05:04.530> so

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
will become fully developed so

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.800 
will become fully developed so
everyone's<00:05:05.670> strong<00:05:05.940> on<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.120> other<00:05:06.360> end<00:05:06.570> can<00:05:06.750> I

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
everyone's strong on the other end can I

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.150 
everyone's strong on the other end can I
tell<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:06.990> do<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.140> bicep<00:05:07.350> curl<00:05:07.500> right<00:05:07.740> here

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
tell you do a bicep curl right here

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.560 
tell you do a bicep curl right here
somebody's<00:05:08.730> you're<00:05:09.000> pretty<00:05:09.180> strong<00:05:09.360> you

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
somebody's you're pretty strong you

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.760 
somebody's you're pretty strong you
probably<00:05:09.900> some<00:05:10.050> massive<00:05:10.380> amount<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.650> weight

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
probably some massive amount of weight

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.250 
probably some massive amount of weight
if<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.400> tell<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.670> do<00:05:11.760> here<00:05:12.150> or<00:05:12.690> here<00:05:13.050> you're

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
if I tell you to do here or here you're

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.320 
if I tell you to do here or here you're
probably<00:05:13.440> really<00:05:13.740> weak<00:05:13.980> as<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.130> kid<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
probably really weak as a kid so the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.730 
probably really weak as a kid so the
idea<00:05:15.570> behind<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.900> bursary<00:05:16.140> matches<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.650> get

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
idea behind a bursary matches to get

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.230 
idea behind a bursary matches to get
really<00:05:17.130> strong<00:05:17.370> at<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.640> extreme<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.060> most

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
really strong at the extreme so most

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.400 
really strong at the extreme so most
people<00:05:18.300> can't<00:05:18.570> even<00:05:18.720> get<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.080> extremes

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
people can't even get to the extremes

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.140 
people can't even get to the extremes
that's<00:05:20.040> why<00:05:20.160> we<00:05:20.280> thought<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.580> month<00:05:20.730> one<00:05:20.820> we

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
that's why we thought for month one we

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.370 
that's why we thought for month one we
have<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.600> address<00:05:21.780> these<00:05:21.960> muscular

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
have to address these muscular

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.050 
have to address these muscular
imbalances<00:05:22.830> this<00:05:23.310> monstrous<00:05:23.700> code<00:05:23.910> and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
imbalances this monstrous code and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.270 
imbalances this monstrous code and
Asians<00:05:24.390> that<00:05:24.480> people<00:05:24.810> just<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.500> bad<00:05:25.920> moving

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
Asians that people just the bad moving

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.950 
Asians that people just the bad moving
patterns<00:05:26.430> people<00:05:26.730> just<00:05:26.940> can't<00:05:27.150> get<00:05:27.270> there<00:05:27.510> so

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
patterns people just can't get there so

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.050 
patterns people just can't get there so
he<00:05:28.080> can<00:05:28.890> me<00:05:29.010> get<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.430> extreme<00:05:29.670> patients

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
he can me get to the extreme patients

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.090 
he can me get to the extreme patients
get<00:05:30.240> strong<00:05:30.450> it's<00:05:31.290> not<00:05:31.350> as<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.560> person<00:05:31.830> we<00:05:31.920> want

that<00:05:41.250> it's<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:41.490> simple<00:05:41.760> it's<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.420> few<00:05:42.600> minor

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
that it's so simple it's a few minor

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.900 
that it's so simple it's a few minor
Corrections<00:05:43.320> but<00:05:43.500> boom<00:05:43.890> I'll<00:05:44.430> say<00:05:44.580> hey<00:05:44.760> my

chest in fact is true it's pretty cool
definitely<00:05:49.860> phase<00:05:50.190> one<00:05:50.490> is<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:54.540> potential<00:05:55.440> if

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
definitely phase one is the potential if

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.290 
definitely phase one is the potential if
