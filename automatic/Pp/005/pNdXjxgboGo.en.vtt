00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
probably enough in most cases and cool

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
something this is strong so I would say

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.679 
something this is strong so I would say
one<00:02:25.680> behind<00:02:25.950> me<00:02:26.159> each<00:02:26.400> ear<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.299> best<00:02:27.510> way

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
one behind me each ear is the best way

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.119
