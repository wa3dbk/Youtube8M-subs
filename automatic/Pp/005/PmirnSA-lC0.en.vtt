may<00:00:35.550> notice<00:00:35.730> something<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.090> little<00:00:36.270> different

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
may notice something a little different

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510 
may notice something a little different
about<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> programs<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.380> HTM<00:00:37.920> file<00:00:38.190> here

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about the programs that HTM file here

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.830 
about the programs that HTM file here
and<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> doesn't<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.690> any

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and that's that it doesn't have any

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.870 
and that's that it doesn't have any
Styles<00:00:40.350> applied<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> whatsoever

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
Styles applied to it whatsoever

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.750 
Styles applied to it whatsoever
so<00:00:42.300> basically<00:00:42.990> it<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.350> style<00:00:43.980> free<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so basically it is style free for the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
so basically it is style free for the
most<00:00:44.820> part<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.080> want<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.470> is<00:00:46.680> start

that particular workflow you'll notice
that<00:04:26.540> we<00:04:26.690> were<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.140> able<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.620> choose<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.280> media

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
that we were not able to choose a media

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.730 
that we were not able to choose a media
type<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.360> we<00:04:29.480> couldn't<00:04:29.690> do<00:04:29.810> any<00:04:29.990> type<00:04:30.200> of<00:04:30.229> media
