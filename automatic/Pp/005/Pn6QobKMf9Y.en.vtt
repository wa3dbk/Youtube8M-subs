 kristina speak world-class rider and 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.290
 Olympic medalist familiar 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.290
 for years on slip of passy 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.270

 world novelty the sirius dressage saddle with 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.480
 mrt system 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.360
 i've been training christina for a while now 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.320
 2009 except a substantial portion 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.760
 talent it is obviously important that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.720
 Horse and rider perfect to each other 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.040
 fit and work hard 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.970
 otherwise, successes are at this level 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.190
 not possible 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.350
 christina is now world class 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.100
 and of course she needs one for that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 appropriate equipment 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.079
 the special the mrt system of sirius 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.640
 the new shape of the head ensures that 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.439
 that the scapula cartilage of the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.319
 horses is no longer restricted 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.789
 and the shoulder can freely rotate that 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.750
 horse can work in all grades 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.750
 move freely 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.480
 It is important that I am in the saddle 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 I feel and do that only when I know 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.200
 that he is the greatest possible 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.070
 has freedom of movement and is free 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.990
 can unfold 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.040
 because only then can we work together 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.040
 bring good performance 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.930
 the training with the new was serious 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.270
 pretty interesting it is direct 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.160
 positively noticed that the saddle one 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.960
 exceptionally good fit 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.450
 is really the feeling that 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.170
 she the horse with the sirius free 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.450
 move 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.970
 that is for the whole looseness 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.000
 of the horse for optimal training 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.680
 and of course for the long term for the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.680
 Success warned me very much 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.180
 It's important for me to get involved 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.640
 manufacturer's thoughts on how to do it 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.390
 laws and accessories still horses 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.390
 can make you friendlier 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.420
 I am happy about the partnerships 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.490
 I also fell in love with my horses 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.970
 really good they seem released and 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.970
 satisfied 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.829
