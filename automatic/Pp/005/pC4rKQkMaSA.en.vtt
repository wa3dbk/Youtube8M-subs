00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
as much the second time there's another

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.629 
as much the second time there's another
hand<00:05:32.639> plan<00:05:32.939> that<00:05:33.569> Heidi's<00:05:33.960> getting<00:05:34.639> notice

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
hand plan that Heidi's getting notice

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.040 
hand plan that Heidi's getting notice
how<00:05:35.729> he<00:05:35.789> keeps<00:05:36.000> height<00:05:36.330> on<00:05:36.479> each<00:05:36.599> side<00:05:36.870> they

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
how he keeps height on each side they

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.929 
how he keeps height on each side they
really<00:05:37.379> accelerate<00:05:37.919> across<00:05:38.159> the<00:05:38.310> bottom<00:05:38.669> of

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:38.939 
really accelerate across the bottom of

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.850 
really accelerate across the bottom of
the<00:05:39.060> pole<00:05:39.270> with<00:05:39.419> their<00:05:39.539> legs<00:05:39.779> pushing<00:05:40.680> into

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
the pole with their legs pushing into

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.140 
the pole with their legs pushing into
their<00:05:40.979> board<00:05:41.219> to<00:05:41.400> keep<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.699> moving<00:05:41.939> really

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
their board to keep it moving really

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.070 
their board to keep it moving really
fast<00:05:42.300> I<00:05:44.090> guess<00:05:45.090> there's<00:05:45.330> some<00:05:45.389> similarities

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
fast I guess there's some similarities

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.980 
fast I guess there's some similarities
between<00:05:46.229> this<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:47.069> the<00:05:47.279> circle<00:05:47.819> right<00:05:48.539> a<00:05:48.810> lot

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
between this and the circle right a lot

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.689 
between this and the circle right a lot
of<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.169> lot<00:05:49.379> of<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.589> skaters<00:05:49.979> are<00:05:50.189> real<00:05:50.520> good

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
of the lot of the skaters are real good
