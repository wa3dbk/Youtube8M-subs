00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
let's get right into it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.429 
let's get right into it
tip<00:01:03.510> number<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.640> start<00:01:05.640> having<00:01:06.479> homemade

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
tip number one start having homemade

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
tip number one start having homemade
weight<00:01:08.220> gain<00:01:08.549> shapes<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.299> reason<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.720> don't

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
weight gain shapes the reason I don't

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.980 
weight gain shapes the reason I don't
recommend<00:01:10.670> regular<00:01:11.689> weight<00:01:12.689> gain<00:01:12.960> shakes

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
recommend regular weight gain shakes

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
recommend regular weight gain shakes
that<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:14.100> some<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> powder

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that you get from some kind of a powder

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.620 
that you get from some kind of a powder
is<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.900> typically<00:01:16.409> they're<00:01:16.920> either<00:01:17.100> one

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
is because typically they're either one

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
is because typically they're either one
expensive<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.840> two<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:20.340> very<00:01:20.759> nutrient<00:01:21.450> dense

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
expensive or two not very nutrient dense

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.780 
expensive or two not very nutrient dense
so<00:01:22.110> although<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> calories

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so although they have a lot of calories

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.620 
so although they have a lot of calories
they<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.140> many<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.920> terms<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
they don't have many in terms of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.899 
they don't have many in terms of
vitamins<00:01:27.630> minerals<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.350> even<00:01:28.590> fiber<00:01:28.950> alright

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
vitamins minerals or even fiber alright

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.410 
vitamins minerals or even fiber alright
so<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.420> recommend<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.680> is
