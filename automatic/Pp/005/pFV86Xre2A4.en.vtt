 Bolivia crossed its airspace 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.730
 suspect that the former employee of the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.500
 edward nolden was on board 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.050
 night added that the diversion was a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.699
 act of aggression against his country and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.500
 equal to a kidnap of the president 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 Bolivian 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.789
 he also warned that the change could 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.589
 cause irreparable damage to the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.149
 diplomatic relations with the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.090

 Bolivia not only condemns these acts but 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.340
 take all legal measures 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.959

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.090
 forgot to say llorenti 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:21.000

 more than 12 hours 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.580
 a white house order 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.099
 we have no doubt for 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.560
 any reason a diplomatic plan with 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:39.929
 the president where the airplane should be
