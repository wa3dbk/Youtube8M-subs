00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
everyone Nathan here today I thought we

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.170 
everyone Nathan here today I thought we
would<00:00:05.720> take<00:00:05.960> a<00:00:06.020> closer<00:00:06.350> look<00:00:06.680> at<00:00:06.920> a<00:00:06.980> claim<00:00:07.910> that

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
would take a closer look at a claim that

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.510 
would take a closer look at a claim that
is<00:00:08.240> made<00:00:08.630> by<00:00:08.809> some<00:00:09.110> types<00:00:09.320> of<00:00:09.500> cleansers<00:00:09.680> we'll

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
is made by some types of cleansers we'll

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.799 
is made by some types of cleansers we'll
take<00:00:10.850> a<00:00:10.879> look<00:00:11.090> at<00:00:11.209> whether<00:00:11.420> or<00:00:11.539> not<00:00:11.629> it's

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
take a look at whether or not it's

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.939 
take a look at whether or not it's
actually<00:00:12.080> something<00:00:12.260> that's<00:00:12.410> possible

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:12.949 
actually something that's possible

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.560 
actually something that's possible
whether<00:00:13.340> it<00:00:13.520> can<00:00:13.610> really<00:00:13.789> help<00:00:14.000> you<00:00:14.119> and<00:00:14.480> if

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
whether it can really help you and if

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.410 
whether it can really help you and if
not<00:00:14.600> what<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:15.379> can<00:00:15.650> use<00:00:15.830> instead<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.150> the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
not what you can use instead so the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.210 
not what you can use instead so the
claim<00:00:17.630> is<00:00:17.779> cleansers<00:00:18.470> that<00:00:18.679> claim<00:00:19.189> to

on your face one minute to a minute and
then<00:01:45.590> you're<00:01:45.740> gonna<00:01:45.860> rinse<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.280> off<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.670> then

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
then you're gonna rinse it off and then

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.000 
then you're gonna rinse it off and then
it's<00:01:46.910> gone<00:01:47.120> now<00:01:47.810> unfortunately<00:01:48.500> that's<00:01:48.770> not

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's gone now unfortunately that's not

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.920 
it's gone now unfortunately that's not
going<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.250> be<00:01:49.370> nearly<00:01:49.610> enough<00:01:49.940> time<00:01:50.240> for<00:01:50.720> that

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
going to be nearly enough time for that

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.410 
going to be nearly enough time for that
that<00:01:51.530> exfoliant<00:01:52.040> ingredient<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.120> any

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
that exfoliant ingredient to have any

people<00:01:55.730> that's<00:01:55.850> thinking<00:01:56.210> right<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:56.600> well

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
people that's thinking right now well

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.360 
people that's thinking right now well
what<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:57.530> leave<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.830> my<00:01:57.980> face<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.340> I

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
what if I just leave it on my face and I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.910 
what if I just leave it on my face and I
go<00:01:58.520> watch<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.910> TV<00:01:59.060> show<00:01:59.180> well<00:02:00.050> even<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
go watch a TV show well even then

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.740 
go watch a TV show well even then
unfortunately<00:02:01.460> it's<00:02:02.120> still<00:02:02.210> not<00:02:02.480> going<00:02:02.660> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
unfortunately it's still not going to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.090 
unfortunately it's still not going to
get<00:02:02.870> you<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.110> where<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.260> want<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.650> be<00:02:03.800> the

get you to where you want to be the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.830 
get you to where you want to be the
reason<00:02:04.400> why<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.090> these<00:02:05.390> types<00:02:05.690> of

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
reason why is that these types of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.100 
reason why is that these types of
exfoliants<00:02:06.560> also<00:02:07.160> have<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.370> very<00:02:07.700> specific

exfoliants also have a very specific

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
chemical environment they need to be in

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
of an average for it to be able to do

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.039 
of an average for it to be able to do
anything<00:02:44.730> at<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.599> those<00:02:45.720> are<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.870> two

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
anything at all so those are the two

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.720 
anything at all so those are the two
things<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:46.950> has<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.189> be<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> leave<00:02:47.579> on

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
things one is it has to be a leave on

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.729 
things one is it has to be a leave on
exfoliant<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.049> two<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.349> has<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> have

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
exfoliant and then two it has to have

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.309 
exfoliant and then two it has to have
that<00:02:49.769> right<00:02:50.099> pH<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.150> what<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.049> really<00:02:52.200> have

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
that right pH so what you really have

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.500 
that right pH so what you really have
here<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.280> plain<00:02:53.519> kind<00:02:53.939> of<00:02:54.060> overpriced

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.210 
here is just a plain kind of overpriced
cleanser<00:02:55.439> and<00:02:55.620> that's<00:02:55.769> really<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.159> what

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
cleanser and that's really not what
