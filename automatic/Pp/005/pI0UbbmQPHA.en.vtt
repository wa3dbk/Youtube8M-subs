00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello gentlemen today in our 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.010
 A review of two no doubt wonderful 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.050
 the apparatus is sony xperia z ritual and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 samsung galaxy s6 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.730
 why we decided to compare phones of two 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.980
 different generations but because our 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.039
 storekeeper Tamara Petrovna a little 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.910
 deaf then and instead of the new sony xperia 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.310
 z3 plus 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.800
 issued an old but proven 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.800
 sony xperia z ritual time 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.619
 Well, as they say in the absence of a maid 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.680
 and the winner of the previous battle of the results 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 your vote has become asus zenfone 2 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.100
 today I will not call anyone 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.910
 wrote the best comment 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 you know so well who is well done seryozha 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.309
 there were times when i was young handsome and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.770
 used nokia 3310 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.379
 No, I'm not talking about grass before. 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.899
 was greener just looking at these two 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.210
 handsome men and think as if they are not accidentally 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.910
 there is no such feeling that they are not 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.969
 strangle you do not kill especially 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.460
 Samsung something tells me that the whole 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.320
 This beauty is after the first 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.990
 landings call but sony everything 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 good sony rumored they 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 doing research on how 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.439
 their smartphone lands and did not come up 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.900
 nothing smarter than making plastic 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.369
 inserts in the corners now you can safely 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.220
 drop the phone tile 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.479
 and thanks to the above 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.270
 shock absorbing inserts when falling 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.439
 the phone bounces back into the arms again 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.439
 according to rumors 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.320
 sony is generally a phone for real 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.150
 optimists on manufacturer claims 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.090
 the phone is well protected from dirt and dust 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.950
 and water as claimed with it can even be 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.259
 dive to the meter depth 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.939
 I have repeatedly met people who climbed 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.170
 swim with new phone 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.170
 and already surfaced Article 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.850
 but it does not matter after that it can still 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.850
 use as a paddle 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.130
 here samsung does not give false hopes and in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.350
 head even thought does not arise about 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 to dive with me somewhere 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.269
 it seems in a sense 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.310
 With 6 much more secure phone and here 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.260
 I suddenly wanted to say about 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.280
 what you visited video circulation site 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.920
 upper.ru 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.980
 and purchased one of these and maybe 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.890
 not from these two handsome men in our store 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.930
 click there under the video somewhere link 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.030
 i should be korean 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.209
 developers task was assigned 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.569
 make the most dull phone no 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.190
 dull and wrong word let's call it 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.690
 relaxing here and so sit and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.640
 poke a finger in the gizzard yet 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.549
 you can unlock for weeks 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 But as a standard, buttons with them are pressed 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.319
 you can know nirvana 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.989
 but sony is another thing buttons for you 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.730
 did a man who in the past stuffed 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 cotton wool in chinese down jackets 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.849
 especially indistinct turned rocker 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.160
 loudness 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.799
 damn it is not clear what place on it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.260
 it is necessary to press and at what point it is clinging on 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.200
 that's what you can really praise 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.239
 sony so this sound remember in times 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.970
 my stormy youth is a good half 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.519
 sonic was generally not heard in his pocket 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.609
 and here they put as many as two speakers and 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.010
 what with such speakers can be easily 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.450
 defile around the village annoying people 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.450
 modern pop music 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:35.349
 and certainly the most enjoyable and as always 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.810
 sony shoved the button back on the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.599
 left edge and you need to have nehily 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.909
 stretching to get to it would be 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.980
 Of course it's great if they could be 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.530
 swap like wil je but 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.629
 the developers apparently decided that so 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.670
 will do but nothing got used to 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.769
 us by the way write in the comments 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.049
 who is familiar with this problem and then me 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.709
 it seems that I am the only one so wonderful 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.109
 the Internet 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.019
 I am pleased to say hello again 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.569
 Our storekeeper Tamara Petrovna Oh and 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.879
 cool screens began to make Samsung prices 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.470
 super amoled, then another 2560 by 1440 points 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.180
 clear already eye cuts and the process that there 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.150
 eight core and front camera then 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.270
 5 megapixels and a fingerprint scanner 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.880
 sony 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.010
 satisfied with four cores but 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.430
 two thousand 500 megahertz 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.789
 the camera here is 20.7 megapixels 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.620
 frontal only two and two so young 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.500
 lovers constantly fotkat their 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.680
 face is not very suitable but here 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.020
 you can shove a 128 gigabyte card 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.990
 plus we have a phone with two on the test 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.389
 Sims and this means that you have one 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.330
 the number will be personal and another for any 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.310
 sound for work i said work 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.979
 for the sake of truth , you need to say that 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.260
 Samsung have this model version of duos 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.660
 so you can't say sony 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.169
 better and in general who is the list of models for 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.720
 review you claimed bastard meta people 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.620

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.310
 find dub 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.080
 and that's when I cool my resume as 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.539
 a man whose old iphone 4s 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.150
 it's a sin to say something bad about 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.159
 these no doubt the standards of modern 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.159
 phone buildings in my humble 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.949
 view samsung made a huge step 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.740
 forward and upward at the same time materials 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.349
 build quality like all this is similar to 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.580
 drank up glued just higher 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.159
 all praise 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.099
 and sony and what sony is it still 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:49.759
 stays cool phone on solid 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:52.339
 the top five although there are no these stupid buttons on 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.199
 write a solid four in the comments 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.930
 which device do you like more 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.389
 although it seems to me here and so everything 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.789
 I know, I know, I didnâ€™t say about 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:05.270
 RAM memory and a whole bunch 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:07.759
 so about this nonsense and so everyone says well 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.770
 don't cry if you really want to 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.110

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:28.279
 upper.ru and about the fact that there is a whole bunch 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.580

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:34.990
 need to go there and buy everything but I will not
