00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
taco truck and I guess the way it all

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.540 
taco truck and I guess the way it all
ties<00:01:06.800> together<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:08.500> my<00:01:09.500> interest<00:01:09.800> for<00:01:09.950> for

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
ties together is my interest for for

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.210 
ties together is my interest for for
like<00:01:10.790> old<00:01:11.060> stuff<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:12.020> guess<00:01:12.530> I'm<00:01:12.710> reaching

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
like old stuff and I guess I'm reaching

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060 
like old stuff and I guess I'm reaching
back<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.780> older<00:01:14.780> times<00:01:15.050> where<00:01:15.530> things<00:01:15.830> were

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
back to older times where things were

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.779 
back to older times where things were
made<00:01:16.250> with<00:01:16.640> more<00:01:16.880> quality<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.190> slower<00:01:19.190> you

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
made with more quality and slower you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.760 
made with more quality and slower you
know<00:01:19.960> we<00:01:20.960> were<00:01:21.050> doing<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.320> lot<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.500> research

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
know we were doing a lot of research

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.580 
know we were doing a lot of research
when<00:01:22.700> we<00:01:22.789> were<00:01:22.940> looking<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.450> buy<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> truck

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
when we were looking to buy a truck

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.510 
when we were looking to buy a truck
because<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:25.399> wanted<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.759> get<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.600> original

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
because we wanted to get the original

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.430 
because we wanted to get the original
step<00:01:28.520> plan<00:01:28.789> that's<00:01:29.149> that's<00:01:29.660> common<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.289> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
step plan that's that's common in the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.650 
step plan that's that's common in the
states<00:01:30.740> where<00:01:31.039> all<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.460> taco<00:01:32.060> trucks<00:01:32.420> are

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
states where all the taco trucks are

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.350 
states where all the taco trucks are
based<00:01:33.350> upon<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.280> couldn't<00:01:34.610> find<00:01:34.789> any<00:01:35.000> one<00:01:35.210> in

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
based upon we couldn't find any one in

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.960 
based upon we couldn't find any one in
Sweden<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.110> we're<00:01:36.380> looking<00:01:36.649> at<00:01:36.800> importing<00:01:37.789> one
