00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
to earlier video that I've been using my

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.200 
to earlier video that I've been using my
pipe<00:00:18.380> bender<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.610> of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> things<00:00:21.060> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
pipe bender but one of the things I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.450 
pipe bender but one of the things I
wanted<00:00:21.540> to<00:00:21.690> get<00:00:21.930> especially<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.279> new

commission<00:00:23.790> i've<00:00:24.060> been<00:00:24.210> working<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
commission i've been working on is a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.040 
commission i've been working on is a
pipe<00:00:25.680> roller<00:00:26.270> so<00:00:27.270> I<00:00:27.330> thought<00:00:27.540> I'd<00:00:27.689> show<00:00:28.020> you

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
pipe roller so I thought I'd show you

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.920 
pipe roller so I thought I'd show you
guys<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.529> difference<00:00:29.000> so<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.540> is<00:00:30.599> my

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
guys the difference so so this is my

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.569 
guys the difference so so this is my
pipe<00:00:31.230> bender<00:00:32.390> it's<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> set<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.650> shoes

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
pipe bender it's got a set of shoes

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.110 
pipe bender it's got a set of shoes
inside<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:37.350> fit<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.250> curb<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> pipe

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
inside the fit the curb of the pipe

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:52.550 
inside the fit the curb of the pipe
itself<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.520> then<00:00:41.520> down<00:00:42.180> inside<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:51.560> see

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
itself and then down inside here see

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.740 
itself and then down inside here see
this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.040> big<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> big<00:00:56.750> shoe

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
this is the big this is the big shoe

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.160 
this is the big this is the big shoe
that<00:00:58.260> fits<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> actual<00:00:59.130> curve<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> pipe

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that fits the actual curve of the pipe

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.600 
that fits the actual curve of the pipe
now<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:02.040> you<00:01:02.610> want<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> fit<00:01:06.170> really

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
now this one you want it to fit really

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.590 
now this one you want it to fit really
nice<00:01:08.840> no<00:01:09.840> snug<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.979> sides<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.579> pipe<00:01:11.790> if

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
nice no snug on the sides of the pipe if

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
nice no snug on the sides of the pipe if
you<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.439> too<00:01:13.710> big<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.270> use<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you use one that's too big if you use a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960 
you use one that's too big if you use a
shoe<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.049> too<00:01:16.259> wide<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:17.460> happens<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
shoe that's too wide what happens is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
shoe that's too wide what happens is
then<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.240> pipe<00:01:18.480> will<00:01:18.810> flatten<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
then the pipe will flatten and if you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.470 
then the pipe will flatten and if you
bend<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> farther

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
bend it farther

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.649 
bend it farther
it<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.870> kink<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.000> sides<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
it will kink but this way the sides of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.750 
it will kink but this way the sides of
the<00:01:24.750> shoe<00:01:24.990> actually<00:01:25.320> hold<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> pipe<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
the shoe actually hold the pipe in and

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.969 
the shoe actually hold the pipe in and
help<00:01:27.270> keep<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> round<00:01:27.870> and<00:01:28.230> help<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.620> to<00:01:28.740> bend

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
help keep it round and help it to bend

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.210 
help keep it round and help it to bend
but<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.510> drawbacks<00:01:30.870> that<00:01:31.440> I<00:01:31.590> found<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
but one of the drawbacks that I found to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.510 
but one of the drawbacks that I found to
using<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.200> machine<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:35.130> doing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
using this kind of machine for doing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
using this kind of machine for doing
long<00:01:36.060> curves<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.010> gets<00:01:38.360> kinky<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
long curves is that it gets kinky you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
long curves is that it gets kinky you
get<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.430> bend<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.060> little

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
get little you get a bend in a little

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
get little you get a bend in a little
straight<00:01:42.510> section<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> bend<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.620> a<00:01:43.650> little

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
straight section and a bend and a little

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.050 
straight section and a bend and a little
straight<00:01:44.040> section<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.940> really

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
straight section you know it's really

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
straight section you know it's really
really<00:01:45.180> hard<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.900> nice<00:01:46.530> smooth<00:01:47.100> curve

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
really hard to get a nice smooth curve

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.230 
really hard to get a nice smooth curve
to<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.969 
to it
yeah<00:01:48.840> let<00:01:48.990> me<00:01:49.020> let<00:01:49.260> me<00:01:49.380> bend<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> little

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
yeah let me let me bend this a little

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.070 
yeah let me let me bend this a little
and<00:01:50.100> I'll<00:01:50.220> show<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.510> some<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> pipe<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
and I'll show you some of the pipe in

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.170 
and I'll show you some of the pipe in
there<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.380> course<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.740> got<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.180> Boston

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
Boston Pops to finally get the shoe to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.370 
Boston Pops to finally get the shoe to
come<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.119> hit<00:01:57.240> against<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.750> die<00:01:57.900> or<00:01:58.260> hit

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
come up and hit against to die or hit

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.580 
come up and hit against to die or hit
against<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> pipe<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.280> pipe<00:01:59.790> against<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
against the pipe and pipe against the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.670 
against the pipe and pipe against the
upper<00:02:01.590> folder

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.580 

this<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.090> 12-ton<00:02:09.090> hydraulic<00:02:10.020> cab<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this is a 12-ton hydraulic cab I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.010 
this is a 12-ton hydraulic cab I
actually<00:02:11.040> cut<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.460> little<00:02:11.850> bit<00:02:11.970> bigger<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:15.020> hit

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
actually cut a little bit bigger so hit

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:43.780 
actually cut a little bit bigger so hit
a<00:02:16.050> new<00:02:16.230> very<00:02:16.500> nice<00:02:16.710> job<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.300> single<00:02:19.020> bed<00:02:19.260> I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.160 

just<00:02:44.790> ran<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.150> through<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.690> bent<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.020> in

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
just ran that through and I bent it in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.470 
just ran that through and I bent it in
three<00:02:46.590> different<00:02:46.830> places<00:02:47.210> moving<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.300> you

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
three different places moving it you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.000 
three different places moving it you
know<00:02:48.600> maybe<00:02:48.780> an<00:02:48.990> inch<00:02:49.230> at<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> time<00:02:49.530> just

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
know maybe an inch at a time just

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.280 
know maybe an inch at a time just
shoveling<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.820> shuffling<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.810> through<00:02:52.050> just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
shoveling you shuffling it through just

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.020 
shoveling you shuffling it through just
a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.680> bit<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.070> trying<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> get<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.580> smooth

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
a little bit just trying to get a smooth

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.080 
a little bit just trying to get a smooth
curve<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.990> there<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.850> see<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
curve out of there and you see it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.699 
curve out of there and you see it
started<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.510> flatten<00:02:57.990> out<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.170> little<00:02:58.470> bit

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
started to flatten out a little bit

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.080 
started to flatten out a little bit
right<00:02:58.740> here<00:02:59.070> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> top<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:01.940> if<00:03:02.940> you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
right here on the top but then if you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.090 
right here on the top but then if you
look<00:03:03.240> in<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.709> what<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:04.890> was

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
look in here see this is what I was

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.390 
look in here see this is what I was
trying<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.580> not<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:08.130> these<00:03:08.340> little

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
trying to not have is all these little

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.660 
trying to not have is all these little
ridges<00:03:08.880> these<00:03:09.480> little<00:03:09.750> bumps<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:11.459> that's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
ridges these little bumps and that's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.040 
ridges these little bumps and that's
where<00:03:11.910> when<00:03:12.360> you're<00:03:12.510> bending<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.020> pipe

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
where when you're bending the pipe

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.400 
where when you're bending the pipe
what's<00:03:13.860> happening<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.690> top<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
what's happening is on the top is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.729 
what's happening is on the top is
starting<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> stretch<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.260> bottom

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
starting to stretch but on the bottom

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.199 
starting to stretch but on the bottom
it's<00:03:20.220> starting<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.730> compress<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:24.060> get

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it's starting to compress so you get

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.430 
it's starting to compress so you get
these<00:03:24.300> little<00:03:24.480> ridges<00:03:24.750> these<00:03:25.170> little

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
these little ridges these little

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.199 
these little ridges these little
pressure<00:03:25.769> ridges<00:03:26.130> you're<00:03:26.519> just<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.910> snow

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
pressure ridges you're just like in snow

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.780 
pressure ridges you're just like in snow
or<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.840> ice<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:27.989> ice<00:03:28.440> packs<00:03:28.769> together<00:03:29.070> don't

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
or in ice and ice packs together don't

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.350 
or in ice and ice packs together don't
you<00:03:29.880> get<00:03:30.030> these<00:03:30.150> little<00:03:30.330> bumps<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.680> roller

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
you get these little bumps so a roller

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.390 
you get these little bumps so a roller
piper<00:03:33.360> roller<00:03:33.890> actually<00:03:34.890> does<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> much<00:03:35.370> better

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
piper roller actually does a much better

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360 
piper roller actually does a much better
job<00:03:35.760> at<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.080> come<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:37.769> over<00:03:37.800> here<00:03:38.040> let<00:03:38.280> me

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
job at this so come on over here let me

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.970 
job at this so come on over here let me
show<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.730> machine<00:03:39.590> till<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> see<00:03:40.830> this

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
show you this machine till you see this

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.320 
show you this machine till you see this
is<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> pipe<00:03:41.489> or<00:03:41.730> older<00:03:42.680> got<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.670> same<00:03:44.880> sort<00:03:45.120> of

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
is a pipe or older got the same sort of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.660 
is a pipe or older got the same sort of
shoe<00:03:45.840> arrangement<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:46.650> die<00:03:46.800> arrangement<00:03:47.580> if

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
shoe arrangement or die arrangement if

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.509 
shoe arrangement or die arrangement if
you<00:03:47.790> will<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.630> ball<00:03:49.170> bearings<00:03:49.200> inside<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
you will with ball bearings inside so it

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.880 
you will with ball bearings inside so it
rolls<00:03:50.760> really<00:03:51.090> smooth<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:52.290> got<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.739> that's

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
rolls really smooth it's got one that's

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.820 
rolls really smooth it's got one that's
fixed<00:03:53.550> at<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.820> top<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:54.900> fixed<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.530> shaft

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
fixed at the top it's fixed to the shaft

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.580 
fixed at the top it's fixed to the shaft
and<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.580> turns<00:03:56.850> with<00:03:57.209> wheel<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.440> why

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
and so it turns with wheel this is why

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.430 
and so it turns with wheel this is why
you<00:03:58.650> feed<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.250> through<00:03:59.690> this<00:04:00.690> one<00:04:00.989> at<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> top

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
you feed it through this one at the top

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.699 
you feed it through this one at the top
adjusts<00:04:02.340> up<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.670> down<00:04:02.850> with<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.500> wrench

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
adjusts up and down with just a wrench

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.580 
adjusts up and down with just a wrench
so<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.489> add<00:04:05.730> pressure<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.269> it<00:04:06.600> pushing

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
so you can add pressure to it pushing

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.190 
so you can add pressure to it pushing
down<00:04:07.860> in<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.580> middle<00:04:09.000> between<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.540> two

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
down in the middle between the two

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.260 
down in the middle between the two
strollers<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.340> that's<00:04:11.700> how<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:11.879> get<00:04:12.150> your

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
strollers and that's how you get your

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.360 
strollers and that's how you get your
curve<00:04:12.569> let<00:04:13.379> me<00:04:13.470> put<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.739> pipe<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.280> I'll

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
curve let me put this pipe in and I'll

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:30.000 
curve let me put this pipe in and I'll
show<00:04:14.400> you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.380 

I<00:04:32.190> think<00:04:33.190> he<00:04:33.250> doesn't<00:04:33.490> remember<00:04:33.580> what<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.090> is

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
I think he doesn't remember what this is

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.710 
I think he doesn't remember what this is
you<00:04:34.900> can't<00:04:35.110> get<00:04:35.290> too<00:04:35.440> big<00:04:35.590> hurt<00:04:36.540> because<00:04:37.540> it's

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
you can't get too big hurt because it's

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.930 
you can't get too big hurt because it's
all<00:04:37.840> be<00:04:38.020> done<00:04:38.230> manually<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.580> know<00:04:39.670> you're

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
all be done manually you know you're

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.270 
all be done manually you know you're
going<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.120> have<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.390> go<00:04:40.510> slow<00:04:41.260> with<00:04:41.650> your<00:04:41.950> push

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
going to have to go slow with your push

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.570 
going to have to go slow with your push
down<00:04:43.090> don't<00:04:43.750> don't<00:04:44.260> put<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:45.190> know<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.310> six

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
down don't don't put a you know a six

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.160 
down don't don't put a you know a six
foot<00:04:45.760> breaker<00:04:46.000> bar<00:04:46.330> on<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.900> just<00:04:47.050> try<00:04:47.140> to

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
foot breaker bar on it and just try to

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.750 
foot breaker bar on it and just try to
crank<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.800> thing<00:04:47.860> down<00:04:48.280> because<00:04:48.640> you'll

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
crank that thing down because you'll

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.790 
crank that thing down because you'll
never<00:04:48.850> be<00:04:49.000> able<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.330> turn<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.780> roller<00:04:50.020> turn

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
never be able to turn the roller turn

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.830 
never be able to turn the roller turn
the<00:04:51.010> feed<00:04:51.220> roller<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:52.150> get<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.330> pipe<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.720> go

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
the feed roller to get the pipe to go

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.770 
the feed roller to get the pipe to go
through<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.230> can't<00:04:53.440> bend<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:53.920> quickly

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.210 

so<00:05:01.780> how<00:05:01.930> much<00:05:02.110> he's<00:05:02.350> dropping<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:02.920> upper

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
so how much he's dropping that upper

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.850 
so how much he's dropping that upper
roller<00:05:03.460> at<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:03.790> time

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
roller at a time

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.330 
roller at a time
well<00:05:05.860> I'm<00:05:06.190> going<00:05:06.520> go<00:05:06.880> probably<00:05:08.310> well<00:05:09.310> a

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
well I'm going go probably well a

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.310 
well I'm going go probably well a
sixteenth<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.210> turn<00:05:10.450> there<00:05:10.990> maybe<00:05:11.140> an

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
sixteenth of a turn there maybe an

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.890 
sixteenth of a turn there maybe an
eighth<00:05:11.500> of<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.800> turn<00:05:12.010> yeah<00:05:12.730> women<00:05:12.880> however<00:05:13.750> much

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
eighth of a turn yeah women however much

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.560 
eighth of a turn yeah women however much
I<00:05:14.080> can<00:05:14.290> get<00:05:14.770> on<00:05:14.980> there<00:05:15.400> which<00:05:15.910> is<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.270> short

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
I can get on there which is this short

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.450 
I can get on there which is this short
little<00:05:16.780> wrench<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.710> know<00:05:17.800> if<00:05:17.920> I<00:05:18.040> don't<00:05:18.220> want

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
little wrench you know if I don't want

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.600 
little wrench you know if I don't want
to<00:05:18.990> try<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.050> force<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.620> through<00:05:20.980> I<00:05:21.220> just<00:05:21.370> want

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
to try to force it through I just want

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:36.250 
to try to force it through I just want
to<00:05:21.730> Knesset<00:05:22.690> through<00:05:22.990> if<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:23.380> will

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.570 

so<00:05:37.260> now<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.440> can<00:05:37.680> see<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.010> is<00:05:38.220> starting<00:05:38.370> to

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
so now you can see this is starting to

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.030 
so now you can see this is starting to
bend<00:05:38.790> already<00:05:39.240> just<00:05:40.050> know<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.290> few<00:05:40.530> passes

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
bend already just know a few passes

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.580 
bend already just know a few passes
three<00:05:41.250> four<00:05:41.490> five<00:05:41.820> passes<00:05:42.360> through<00:05:42.570> there<00:05:42.780> put

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
three four five passes through there put

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.440 
three four five passes through there put
on<00:05:43.740> yo<00:05:43.950> eighth<00:05:44.190> of<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.430> term<00:05:44.670> on<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.120> on<00:05:45.330> the

on yo eighth of a term on the on the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.260 
on yo eighth of a term on the on the
wrench<00:05:45.660> at<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.960> time<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:47.340> saw<00:05:47.520> if<00:05:47.730> I<00:05:47.820> did<00:05:48.000> if<00:05:48.180> I

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
wrench at a time you saw if I did if I

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.540 
wrench at a time you saw if I did if I
kept<00:05:48.510> going<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.500> know<00:05:49.560> about<00:05:50.010> anything<00:05:50.310> a

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
kept going and you know about anything a

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.240 
kept going and you know about anything a
turn<00:05:50.760> at<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.060> time<00:05:51.090> on<00:05:51.540> the<00:05:51.660> feed<00:05:52.050> yellow<00:05:53.040> and

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
turn at a time on the feed yellow and

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.920 
turn at a time on the feed yellow and
just<00:05:53.550> turning<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.940> feet<00:05:54.120> wheel<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:54.630> run<00:05:54.840> it

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
just turning the feet wheel to run it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.510 
just turning the feet wheel to run it
back<00:05:55.050> and<00:05:55.290> forth<00:05:55.470> through<00:05:55.740> there<00:05:55.920> just<00:05:56.220> taking

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
back and forth through there just taking

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.940 
back and forth through there just taking
my<00:05:56.760> time<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:57.360> slow<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.900> easy<00:05:58.050> working<00:05:58.650> at<00:05:58.800> it

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
my time you slow and easy working at it

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.830 
my time you slow and easy working at it
you<00:05:59.580> know<00:05:59.640> you<00:05:59.730> can<00:05:59.970> get<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.300> nice<00:06:00.480> curve

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
you know you can get that nice curve

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.110 
you know you can get that nice curve
going<00:06:01.260> but<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:02.040> wouldn't<00:06:02.370> get<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.640> bumps<00:06:02.940> in

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
going but you wouldn't get the bumps in

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.880 
going but you wouldn't get the bumps in
there<00:06:03.270> because<00:06:03.630> you're<00:06:03.900> basically<00:06:04.260> rolling

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
there because you're basically rolling

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.530 
there because you're basically rolling
those<00:06:05.310> out<00:06:05.520> as<00:06:05.820> you're<00:06:05.970> going<00:06:06.150> along

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
those out as you're going along

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.720 
those out as you're going along
you<00:06:07.440> know<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.650> pipe<00:06:07.860> actually<00:06:08.130> gets<00:06:08.550> a<00:06:08.640> little

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
you know the pipe actually gets a little

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.550 
you know the pipe actually gets a little
bit<00:06:08.970> longer<00:06:09.240> as<00:06:09.630> you're<00:06:09.780> doing<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.230> it's<00:06:10.440> you

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
bit longer as you're doing this it's you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.230 
bit longer as you're doing this it's you
know<00:06:10.650> sometimes<00:06:11.280> depending<00:06:11.670> on<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:11.820> bands

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
know sometimes depending on the bands

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.120 
know sometimes depending on the bands
you're<00:06:12.390> making<00:06:12.720> because<00:06:13.410> you<00:06:13.560> got<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.830> take

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
you're making because you got to take

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.550 
you're making because you got to take
this<00:06:14.340> excess<00:06:14.850> metal<00:06:15.120> so<00:06:16.110> it's<00:06:16.200> got<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.470> go

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
this excess metal so it's got to go

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.710 
this excess metal so it's got to go
someplace<00:06:16.860> dope<00:06:17.790> so<00:06:18.000> it<00:06:18.180> gets<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.630> little

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
someplace dope so it gets a little

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.160 
someplace dope so it gets a little
longer<00:06:19.050> inside<00:06:19.560> them<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.810> that's<00:06:21.810> a<00:06:21.930> roller

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
longer inside them so that's a roller

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.210 
longer inside them so that's a roller
versus<00:06:23.130> a<00:06:23.160> bender<00:06:23.640> and<00:06:24.770> this<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:25.950> a<00:06:25.980> great

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
versus a bender and this is a great

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.760 
versus a bender and this is a great
exercise<00:06:26.640> machine<00:06:27.210> also<00:06:27.570> works<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.590> lot<00:06:28.710> on

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
exercise machine also works a lot on

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.960 
exercise machine also works a lot on
your<00:06:29.040> arms<00:06:29.570> where'd<00:06:30.570> you<00:06:30.720> get<00:06:30.870> a<00:06:30.930> cab<00:06:31.260> oh<00:06:31.970> this

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
your arms where'd you get a cab oh this

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.970 
your arms where'd you get a cab oh this

you know take it off of this stand
you'll<00:07:01.770> collapse<00:07:02.100> it<00:07:02.310> down<00:07:02.340> a<00:07:02.490> little<00:07:02.730> bit

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
you'll collapse it down a little bit

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.640 
you'll collapse it down a little bit
nice<00:07:03.330> and<00:07:03.540> store<00:07:03.720> it<00:07:03.870> in<00:07:03.930> the<00:07:03.990> tool<00:07:04.200> room<00:07:04.230> where

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
nice and store it in the tool room where

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.350 
nice and store it in the tool room where
it's<00:07:04.770> out<00:07:04.890> of<00:07:04.920> the<00:07:05.130> way<00:07:05.280> till<00:07:05.910> I<00:07:06.000> need<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.240> the
