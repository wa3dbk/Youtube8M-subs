doesn't feel that fine no notice the
Cotton's<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.860> guess<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.250> guess<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.550> would<00:03:04.670> on

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
Cotton's I guess I guess it would on

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.750 
Cotton's I guess I guess it would on
delicate<00:03:05.270> yeah<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.500> how<00:03:06.770> much<00:03:06.980> more<00:03:07.460> oh

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
delicate yeah and how much more oh

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.580 
delicate yeah and how much more oh
that's<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.020> amount<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.350> balls<00:03:09.500> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
that's that's the amount of balls that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.840 
that's that's the amount of balls that
would<00:03:09.830> put<00:03:10.010> sing<00:03:10.480> nice<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:13.160> here<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.370> go

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
would put sing nice and here we go

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.970 
would put sing nice and here we go
I<00:03:15.670> think<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.790> will<00:03:16.850> fill<00:03:17.090> up<00:03:17.210> again

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
I think it will fill up again

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.900 
I think it will fill up again
mmm<00:03:19.070> we'll<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.460> let's<00:03:20.270> wait<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.600> see
