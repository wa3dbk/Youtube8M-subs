of the pictures and their political

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.160 
of the pictures and their political
answers<00:01:46.970> anyway<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.300> just<00:01:48.539> really

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
answers anyway it's just really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.719

pointless and even tells the videos
nothing<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> compare<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.820> not

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
nothing to compare to so it's really not

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.389 
nothing to compare to so it's really not
an<00:01:54.090> important<00:01:54.509> part<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> game<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.399> he

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
an important part of the game and he

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
an important part of the game and he
hasn't<00:01:56.520> nothing<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.940> compare<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:57.690> maybe

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
hasn't nothing to compare it to so maybe

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
hasn't nothing to compare it to so maybe
you<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.530> had<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> look<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.130> results<00:02:00.259> you

your new repair skill then to the left
you'll<00:03:04.650> see<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.800> chemistry<00:03:05.190> set<00:03:05.400> where<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.670> can

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
you'll see a chemistry set where you can

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.230 
you'll see a chemistry set where you can

candy<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:18.800> can<00:03:19.069> also<00:03:19.190> talk<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.790> him<00:03:20.000> after<00:03:21.819> you

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
candy you can also talk to him after you

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.180 
candy you can also talk to him after you
finish<00:03:23.270> this<00:03:23.420> dialogue<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:24.349> can<00:03:24.650> get<00:03:24.860> more

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
finish this dialogue so you can get more
