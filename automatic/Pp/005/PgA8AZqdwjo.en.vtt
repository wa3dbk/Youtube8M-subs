00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.750
 manual activities in today's video 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.910
 we will teach you how to prepare a nice 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.740
 hedgehog with colored plasticine and pipes 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.960
 sunflower 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.080
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.610
 aluminum foil sunflower seeds 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.830
 clusterina flesh and color 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.580

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.980
 aluminum 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.119
 we will make a ball like this now 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.119
 we will make plasticine 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.310
 when we have the ball made we make a 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.430
 ball with the pink plasticine and 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.370
 then flatten it moss and we cover the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.030
 ball of aluminum foil with the layer of 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 clay 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.250
 we tighten well and we shape the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.350
 we pay for the base and for one of the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 tips we do a little bit more 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.780
 elongated when we have the body 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.059

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.940
 we put them one by one, which will be the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.740
 our hedgehog's quills we are giving him 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.759
 way until we have it all full 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.759
 respecting the part of the face 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.420
 and to finish and give the touch 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.320

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.320

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.720

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.730

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 and the last one we will place as a nose 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.620
