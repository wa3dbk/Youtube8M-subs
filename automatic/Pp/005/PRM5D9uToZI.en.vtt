we're going to go ahead and talk about

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.320 
we're going to go ahead and talk about
how<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.620> hiding<00:00:14.099> tech<00:00:14.370> spreading<00:00:15.210> out

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
how you hiding tech spreading out

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.769 
how you hiding tech spreading out
production<00:00:15.870> facilities<00:00:17.180> spreading<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.330> your

production facilities spreading out your

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.529 
production facilities spreading out your
tech<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.670> I'm<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> also<00:00:21.150> talk<00:00:21.480> about

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
tech and I'm going to also talk about

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.640 
tech and I'm going to also talk about
where<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> expand<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.359> terran<00:00:24.359> your<00:00:25.320> Army's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.230 
where to expand as terran your Army's
going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.980> rather<00:00:26.160> slow<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.910> it's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
going to be rather slow and it's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.589 
going to be rather slow and it's
probably<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.930> consist<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.849> mmm<00:00:29.849> siege

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
probably going to consist of mmm siege

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.920

that<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.400> army<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.760> travel<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.689> most<00:01:09.960> of

that your army would travel if most of

that your army would travel if most of

your production is in this portion of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the base your army is going to be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.190 
the base your army is going to be
traveling<00:01:13.729> like<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> mini-map<00:01:15.540> hop

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
traveling like this on the mini-map hop

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
traveling like this on the mini-map hop
into<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> middle<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.460> you're<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> want

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
into the middle so you're going to want

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.109 
into the middle so you're going to want
to<00:01:17.939> expand<00:01:18.330> along<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> line<00:01:19.939> your<00:01:20.939> first

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
to expand along that line your first

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
to expand along that line your first
expansion<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> closest<00:01:22.200> your

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
expansion would be the closest your

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
expansion would be the closest your
natural<00:01:23.189> expansion<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.850> next<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.210> would

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
natural expansion the next one would

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.679 
natural expansion the next one would
probably<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.900> over<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.909> although<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.330> your

probably be over here although if your

probably be over here although if your

location and you're at the top you might
even<00:01:32.369> expand<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.329> third<00:01:33.509> because

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
even expand here at your third because

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.569 
even expand here at your third because
your<00:01:34.200> army<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.460> this

and<00:02:06.140> say<00:02:07.130> my<00:02:07.280> opponent<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.730> slower<00:02:08.030> vase

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
and say my opponent is a slower vase

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.070 
and say my opponent is a slower vase
Protoss<00:02:09.710> retired<00:02:10.570> probably<00:02:11.570> let's<00:02:11.990> say

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
Protoss retired probably let's say

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.570 
Protoss retired probably let's say
Protoss<00:02:12.410> I'd<00:02:13.310> want<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.670> expand<00:02:15.460> for<00:02:16.460> my<00:02:16.550> third

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
Protoss I'd want to expand for my third

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.210 
Protoss I'd want to expand for my third
base<00:02:16.990> I'll<00:02:17.990> probably<00:02:18.290> take<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:19.040> because

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
base I'll probably take this one because

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.550 
base I'll probably take this one because
it's<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:19.550> easily<00:02:19.730> easily<00:02:20.300> defended<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.320> after

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it's so easily easily defended but after

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.860 
it's so easily easily defended but after
that<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:21.950> take<00:02:22.820> either<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.510> space<00:02:24.070> this<00:02:25.070> space

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that I take either the space this space

away from the Protoss player which means

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.160 
away from the Protoss player which means
you're<00:02:36.350> going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.590> want<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.860> take<00:02:36.980> those<00:02:38.170> over

this<00:07:29.720> you<00:07:29.870> up<00:07:30.080> like<00:07:30.740> Marines<00:07:31.840> more<00:07:32.840> time<00:07:33.050> to

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
this you up like Marines more time to

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.320 
this you up like Marines more time to
chase<00:07:33.740> or<00:07:34.040> shoot<00:07:34.550> things<00:07:34.760> in<00:07:34.910> the<00:07:35.000> air<00:07:35.120> because

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
chase or shoot things in the air because

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.500 
chase or shoot things in the air because
I<00:07:35.360> have<00:07:35.480> more<00:07:35.540> ground<00:07:35.810> to<00:07:35.930> cover<00:07:36.020> and<00:07:37.510> that

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:38.510 
I have more ground to cover and that

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.270 
I have more ground to cover and that
covers<00:07:38.810> all<00:07:39.230> the<00:07:39.260> topics<00:07:39.710> I<00:07:39.830> wanted<00:07:40.070> to<00:07:40.130> cover
