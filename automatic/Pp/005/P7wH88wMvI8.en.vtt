do you begin with this thing let's take

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.729 
do you begin with this thing let's take
a<00:00:31.700> look<00:00:31.820> at<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.000> side<00:00:32.210> view<00:00:32.239> real<00:00:32.540> quick<00:00:32.780> this

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
a look at the side view real quick this

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.890 
a look at the side view real quick this
will<00:00:33.890> help<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.370> determine<00:00:35.180> that<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.809> know

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
will help to determine that you know

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.930 
will help to determine that you know
when<00:00:36.080> when<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.410> when<00:00:36.830> the<00:00:36.950> engine<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.640> in

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
when when you when the engine is is in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.680 
when when you when the engine is is in
the<00:00:38.030> mid<00:00:38.210> section

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
the mid section

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.630 
the mid section
it<00:00:38.900> changes<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.980> design<00:00:40.280> approach

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
it changes the design approach

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.450 
it changes the design approach
completely<00:00:41.540> from<00:00:42.199> from<00:00:42.770> front<00:00:42.980> engine<00:00:43.250> cars

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
completely from from front engine cars

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.060 
completely from from front engine cars
it<00:00:43.940> becomes<00:00:44.300> more<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.989> should<00:00:45.559> become<00:00:45.890> more

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
it becomes more of it should become more

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.700 
it becomes more of it should become more
of<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.250> cab<00:00:46.460> forward<00:00:46.790> type<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.360> feel<00:00:47.710> there's

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
of a cab forward type of feel there's

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.619 
of a cab forward type of feel there's
less<00:00:49.129> room<00:00:49.640> up<00:00:49.850> front<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:50.270> don't<00:00:50.360> have<00:00:50.540> to

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
less room up front you don't have to

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.120 
less room up front you don't have to
have<00:00:50.750> all<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.050> bulk<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.500> motor<00:00:51.680> up<00:00:51.890> front

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
have all the bulk of the motor up front

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.040 
have all the bulk of the motor up front
so<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.700> can<00:00:52.820> have<00:00:52.970> a<00:00:53.000> kind<00:00:53.360> of<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.570> short<00:00:53.840> area

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
so you can have a kind of a short area

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.760 
so you can have a kind of a short area
now<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.180> an<00:00:56.390> Audi<00:00:56.600> but<00:00:57.320> if<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.590> were<00:00:57.680> to

headlights<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:58.070> Audi<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.490> particular

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
headlights but this Audi in particular

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.660 
headlights but this Audi in particular
has<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.299> this<00:01:59.720> meant<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.380> center<00:02:00.830> black

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
has this this meant the center black

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.670 
has this this meant the center black
panel<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:02.210> take<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:02.990> black<00:02:03.229> panel

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
panel you take that that black panel

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.940 
panel you take that that black panel
away<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.250> becomes<00:02:04.340> kind<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.140> not<00:02:06.140> generic<00:02:06.619> but

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
away it becomes kind of not generic but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.199 
away it becomes kind of not generic but
becomes<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.520> little<00:02:07.790> less<00:02:08.290> design<00:02:09.290> oriented

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
becomes a little less design oriented

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.610 
becomes a little less design oriented
you<00:02:11.209> put<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.480> panel<00:02:11.780> back<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.140> which<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.440> think

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you put that panel back in which I think

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.900 
you put that panel back in which I think
comes<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.980> variety<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.340> different<00:02:13.489> colors

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
comes in a variety of different colors

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.170 
comes in a variety of different colors
and<00:02:14.120> carbon<00:02:14.540> fiber<00:02:14.799> it's<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.250> very<00:02:16.489> very

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and carbon fiber it's a it's a very very

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.259 
and carbon fiber it's a it's a very very
cool<00:02:17.480> design<00:02:17.720> element<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.850> very<00:02:20.120> unusual

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
cool design element that is very unusual

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.390 
cool design element that is very unusual
for<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.810> car<00:02:21.019> like<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.350> now<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.950> want<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> click

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
for a car like this now I want to click

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.510 
for a car like this now I want to click
on<00:02:22.549> something<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.940> can<00:02:23.090> draw<00:02:23.269> on

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
on something so I can draw on

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
on something so I can draw on
real<00:02:23.730> quick<00:02:23.910> well<00:02:24.630> also<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.200> about<00:02:25.350> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
real quick well also I like about this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.860 
real quick well also I like about this
car<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.070> how<00:02:26.280> these<00:02:26.700> lines<00:02:27.060> match<00:02:27.390> up<00:02:27.630> check

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
car is how these lines match up check

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.980 
car is how these lines match up check
this<00:02:28.020> out<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.860> way<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.160> over<00:02:29.990> straight

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
this out all the way up over straight

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.050 
this out all the way up over straight
shot<00:02:31.200> pew<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:33.470> back<00:02:34.470> hip<00:02:34.740> again<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> back<00:02:35.850> out

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
shot pew and back hip again and back out

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.060 
shot pew and back hip again and back out
that's<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:37.770> unusual<00:02:38.090> design

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
that's that's a really unusual design

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.420 
that's that's a really unusual design
design<00:02:41.070> sculpture<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.910> line<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.720> sight<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.430> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
design sculpture a line of sight so it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.650 
design sculpture a line of sight so it
really<00:02:44.940> makes<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.270> car<00:02:45.570> different<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.660> as

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
really makes this car different and as

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.050 
really makes this car different and as
this<00:02:48.900> line<00:02:49.170> comes<00:02:49.470> across<00:02:49.650> here<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.670> this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
this line comes across here this this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180 
this line comes across here this this
cut<00:02:51.510> line<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.110> stops<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.650> terminates<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
cut line it stops it terminates at the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.830 
cut line it stops it terminates at the
door<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.000> picks<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.300> again<00:02:54.420> towards

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
door and then it picks up again towards

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.080 
door and then it picks up again towards
the<00:02:54.960> rear<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.890> would<00:02:56.010> think<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.340> this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the rear and you would think that this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.900 
the rear and you would think that this
element<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.810> door<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.620> cut<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.790> know

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
element in the door this cut you know

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.730 
element in the door this cut you know
would<00:03:00.210> kind<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.780> line<00:03:01.050> up<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:01.620> it

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
would kind of line up with that but it

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.760 
would kind of line up with that but it
doesn't<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.940> still<00:03:03.480> works<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.500> got<00:03:04.650> this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
doesn't and it still works you got this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.800 
doesn't and it still works you got this
little<00:03:04.920> hip<00:03:05.220> that's<00:03:05.790> right<00:03:06.030> here<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.660> almost

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
little hip that's right here that almost

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.240 
little hip that's right here that almost
makes<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.230> it's<00:03:07.410> two<00:03:07.620> cars<00:03:07.860> put<00:03:08.100> together

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
makes like it's two cars put together

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.540 
makes like it's two cars put together
but<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.940> still<00:03:09.270> works<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.130> kind<00:03:11.370> of

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
but it still works and that is kind of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.190 
but it still works and that is kind of
the<00:03:11.670> language<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.240> this<00:03:12.420> car<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.900> design

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the language for this car the design

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.560 
the language for this car the design
language<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.710> car<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.300> things<00:03:15.300> that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
language for this car is things that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.080 
language for this car is things that
don't<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:17.010> make<00:03:17.220> sense<00:03:17.490> that<00:03:17.760> all<00:03:17.850> come

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
don't really make sense that all come

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.790 
don't really make sense that all come
together<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.720> actually<00:03:19.110> make<00:03:19.440> sense

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
together to actually make sense

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.420 
together to actually make sense
does<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.430> make<00:03:20.580> sense<00:03:21.980> another<00:03:22.980> element

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
does that make sense another element

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.780 
does that make sense another element
with<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.760> car<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:25.020> idea<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
with this car is the idea of a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.449 
with this car is the idea of a
trapezoidal<00:03:26.790> design<00:03:27.480> reference<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.459> what's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
trapezoidal design reference and what's

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.520 
trapezoidal design reference and what's
neat<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.450> some<00:03:30.660> some<00:03:30.959> pretty

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
neat is you is you have some some pretty

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.170 
neat is you is you have some some pretty
neat<00:03:31.770> shapes<00:03:32.040> they<00:03:32.340> can<00:03:32.459> represent<00:03:32.640> that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
neat shapes they can represent that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
neat shapes they can represent that
here's<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:34.020> here<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:37.709> there's<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.370> lot

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
here's one here you know there's a lot

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.690 
here's one here you know there's a lot
of<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.030> kind<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.540> shape<00:03:39.840> that's<00:03:40.170> going<00:03:40.500> on

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
of that kind of shape that's going on

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.610 
of that kind of shape that's going on
you<00:03:41.700> got<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> see-through<00:03:42.690> glass<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:43.530> can

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
you got the see-through glass you can

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.900 
you got the see-through glass you can
take<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.830> look<00:03:43.950> at<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.160> engine<00:03:44.280> right<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.760> there

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
take a look at the engine right in there

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.590 
take a look at the engine right in there
and<00:03:45.330> even<00:03:45.450> then<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:45.810> shaped<00:03:46.050> look<00:03:46.230> at<00:03:46.350> that

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
and even then it's shaped look at that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.699 
and even then it's shaped look at that
you<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.690> there's<00:03:49.020> a<00:03:49.110> lot<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.440> those<00:03:49.530> elements

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
you know there's a lot of those elements

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.120 
you know there's a lot of those elements
that<00:03:50.010> are<00:03:50.160> going<00:03:50.190> on<00:03:50.580> here's<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.360> again<00:03:52.130> you

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
that are going on here's is again you

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.130 
that are going on here's is again you
know<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:53.880> kind<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> square<00:03:54.810> gone

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
know it's kind of like a square gone

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.070 
know it's kind of like a square gone
wrong<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:56.670> know<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.600> looks<00:03:57.840> pretty

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
wrong you know but it's it looks pretty

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.130 
wrong you know but it's it looks pretty
cool<00:03:58.290> they've<00:03:58.620> done<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.860> really<00:03:59.070> good<00:03:59.340> job

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
cool they've done a really good job

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.350 
cool they've done a really good job
proportionally<00:04:01.190> but<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> big<00:04:03.090> risk

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
proportionally but it was a big risk

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.240 
proportionally but it was a big risk
because<00:04:03.630> outi<00:04:04.200> doesn't<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.740> sports<00:04:05.040> car

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
because outi doesn't have a sports car

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
because outi doesn't have a sports car
and<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:06.300> language<00:04:06.720> was<00:04:06.900> gonna<00:04:07.020> be<00:04:07.290> slightly

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
and the language was gonna be slightly

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.040 
and the language was gonna be slightly
different<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.640> it's<00:04:08.790> not<00:04:09.050> completely

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
different so that it's not completely

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.900 
different so that it's not completely
Audi<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:10.980> were<00:04:11.040> gonna<00:04:11.160> branch<00:04:11.430> into<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> new

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
Audi they were gonna branch into a new

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.480 
Audi they were gonna branch into a new
in<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.150> new<00:04:12.270> area<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.070> they've<00:04:14.070> done<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.280> really

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
in a new area and they've done a really

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.370 
in a new area and they've done a really
good<00:04:14.700> job<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:15.090> being<00:04:15.630> able<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.840> achieve<00:04:15.990> that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
good job at being able to achieve that

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.099 
good job at being able to achieve that
so<00:04:16.620> overall<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.459> think<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.510> Audi<00:04:18.690> r8

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so overall I think that the the Audi r8

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.260 
so overall I think that the the Audi r8
is<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:20.070> very<00:04:20.310> aggressive<00:04:20.580> design<00:04:21.299> it's<00:04:21.630> very

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
is a very aggressive design it's very

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.440 
is a very aggressive design it's very
simplified<00:04:24.270> yet<00:04:24.960> unpredictable<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.450> it

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
simplified yet unpredictable and it

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.290 
simplified yet unpredictable and it
makes<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.169> complete<00:04:28.530> package

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
makes for a complete package

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.810 
makes for a complete package
nice
