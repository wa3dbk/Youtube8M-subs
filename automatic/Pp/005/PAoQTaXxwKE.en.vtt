 working to world that he hearing 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:33.170
 volunteer for next three months 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.960
 yes it is the largest sanctuary of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.819
 So will all primates leon there was 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.949
 a dozen kinds of bonuses to different 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:47.929
 who are who freely deliver in a 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:49.339
 times to 12 hectares my job is 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.739
 so the morning I feed them 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.170
 feed the monkeys clean the cages 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.359
 also and then I learned a lot 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.739
 of things especially the monkey species 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.510
 here to be able to make visits 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.699
 guided so through the forest of 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.309
 one-hour tours for seven 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.509
 hours we explain a little to the visitors 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.520
 all we know about the wise in 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:12.289
 their world we answer to their 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.609
 questions and so we also welcome 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.229
 visitors at the entrance we explain 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.659
 the simple rules since since all 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.170
 the wise here are at liberty 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.020
 they still have to do 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.630
 attention what's left wild if we have 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.490
 often a solution capable of 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 highly endangered species in madagascar 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 the cause of deforestation 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.030
 in fact they spend the majority of their 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:02:02.009
 time in companies in the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:02:03.869
 loves there I always want to 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.250
 work that animals in fact that's 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.649
 my great passion since I am everything 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.380
 small and I found this program 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.110
 internet access is actually like him 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.970
 I found it very interesting it's a 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.250
 great sanctuary for primates are 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.799
 many species here are threatened so 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.780
 it is well being able to camp even the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.730
 conservation places and yeah I 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.079
 found that really very interesting is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:36.660
 what he can help me with my studies 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:37.620
 to come as completely it's right 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.000
 that's exactly what I use 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.920
 really even do internet everything is 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.389
 translated into details and we are all right 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.380
 explain it when I got here I 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.480
 knew where I was going 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.739
 it was not completely unknown in 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.000
 did I already had what was expected of 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.000
 me it's really a good camp 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.400
 already brings a lot more 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.540
 knowledge about life especially 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.340
 animals in captivity 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.590
 then I think that will bring 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.820
 a lot of maturity also made 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.750
 placed alone like that on the other end 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.310
 of the world 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.360
 the object fend for itself more 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.190
 more with English that is not 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.560
 always obvious we know more than 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.570
 maturity and it allows to discover a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.400
 another cisco moment in south africa 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.380
 it does not work at all like 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.560
 with us it's not at all the same 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.560
 thing 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.130
 there are really a lot of things 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.660
 must do in fact one can move 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.240
 very easily with drivers from 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.330
 taxi and howie finally old with 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.980
 sea ​​lions swimming with sharks at 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.590
 watching the whales can jump 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.990
 bungee without parachute 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.890
 safaris of all kinds there really 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.890
 a lot of things to do 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.490
 I want to say and do not hesitate 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.330
 longer actually it's really a 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.270
 very good program 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.519
 it's yeah we really learn a lot of 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.739
 incredible things it's in addition a very 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.170
 beautiful place and there is a lot 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.000
 of activities to do next no that he in 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.010
 is 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.720
 frankly it's here again hesitation 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.720
