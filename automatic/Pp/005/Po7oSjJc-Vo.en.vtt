00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 14 rather common as a cultural asset that is 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.230
 but already true art 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello the movie factory it is 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.440
 again couch classic time and this time 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 i brought a single man and 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.820
 It is the story of George 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.560
 Leashes count for his loss namely 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.150
 his friend is in an accident 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 he wanted to live himself 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.949
 but also shoot before 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 clarify a few things just clean up what 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.859
 I wear my own funeral 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.809
 and even with a few people left 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.149
 finish that one last time 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.010
 visit for example his 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.260
 student kenny but also a longtime 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 girlfriend is visited again like that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.829
 whole looks and what the george and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.829
 Everything is done in the trailer 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.870
 hmm 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.700
 You already notice the trailer 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.329
 It looks very strange 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.030
 obstinate and one particular 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.319
 This work has intense atmosphere 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.700
 that is because tom ford the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.040
 not only be director here 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.569
 Director debut has actually been 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.159
 fashion designer is and he has just completely 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.200
 different feeling for aesthetics for 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.510
 picture composition and you can tell 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.299
 simply because the camera work is great 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.530
 you rarely see that in the form 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.930
 and it is not at all that the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.000
 canvas with a super spectacular 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.939
 is completed but that he 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.950
 simply he has a very own feeling 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.510
 how all this is supposed to happen and there it is 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.340
 even the cut that is all so completely 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.169
 soft into each other 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.540
 and you can tell he's the one too 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.639
 film sees itself as gesamtkunstwerk 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.340
 as if it was now his evening robe 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.379
 everything is interlinked 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.329
 everything is so intertwined and so on 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.790
 You have to imitate this just now 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.010
 as a first film, this is really one 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.900
 absolute shine from the director 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.430
 concerns and in addition to this 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.989
 shine this pictures too 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.609
 also stage like him 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.530
 actor leads namely colin firth 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.319
 for this film already his oscar 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.819
 would have to win his first movie 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.370
 speed was the second because water 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.379
 shown is just incredibly intense 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.389
 incredibly emotional and I'm there like that 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.129
 a melancholic deep in the figure 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.560
 and at the same time also put so 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.909
 many fish ask that you go all the way 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.129
 but you tore it that way 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.449
 is fed by the whole movie and 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.090
 that's really rare because as well 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:43.639
 here the music that was composed for 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.349
 the movie really easy on it 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.940
 it fits so it is really a work of art 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.199
 in itself one must therefore not at all 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.900
 fall to the toilet if you go this 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.709
 you have to watch the movie in it all 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.569
 soak up 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.699
 only small weakness is that it 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.439
 no real arc of tension is what 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.780
 to explain that the film is just 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.729
 works in itself as a work of art and 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 staged in itself here are so 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:07.189
 the normal voltage curves with 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.260
 climax and co dot will be totally 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.019
 this can be disabled for the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.370
 normal audience maybe at some 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.229
 put a little bit lengthy and 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.340
 I can also seem boring 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.199
 understand that that for the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.419
 Incident so overall this is 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.700
 film but in itself at the machart too 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.650
 from his political statement that always 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.710
 again in between lightning and 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.509
 even today so up to date 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.789
 is a really fantastic movie 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.319
 score of 9 out of 10 points 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.180
 strong and acting 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.740
 dramatically just really first 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.680
 be and just look wonder 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.660
 beautiful and I really say that 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.160
 I really seldom wanted you 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.069
 but like to know what are yours 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.840
 moments in film history where he says 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.580
 that's just beautiful as it is 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.870
 looks like and how it is staged 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.449
 write that in the comments 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.610
 I have 500 days of music for you now 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.919
 summer linked that was mine 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.210
 Declaration of love to the film also in 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.699
 a declaration of love comes to life and 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.169
 then energy is always over 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.720
 the couch classic of last week or 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.460
 Just have a look at the special 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.500
 crazy movie part 2 I have 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.060
 Link to you here and then we'll see 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.370
 We'll be back to Bavarian film criticism soon 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.509
 Of course, the film factory with me 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.509
 the view
