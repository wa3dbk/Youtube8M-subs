beginning part of the game you will come

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.600

to<00:02:10.750> fear<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.410> dinosaurs<00:02:11.920> rather<00:02:12.340> than

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
to fear the dinosaurs rather than

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180

planning<00:02:17.769> your<00:02:17.920> escape<00:02:18.130> route<00:02:18.760> rather<00:02:19.090> than

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
planning your escape route rather than

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.170 
planning your escape route rather than
your<00:02:19.510> tax<00:02:19.810> strategy<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.610> one<00:02:21.910> thing

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
your tax strategy and that is one thing
