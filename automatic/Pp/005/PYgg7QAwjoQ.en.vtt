 focus on behavior 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.929
 not on the person 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.179
 this 3 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.259
 calculate the call for 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.300
 tip 4 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.369

 tip 6 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.070
 search for solutions together 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.470
 this 7 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 the sand over it 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.280
 we go over

 necklace choose the right place 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.910
 and the right moment 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.320
 then the conversation because the fourth attempt did not scare people 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.480
 and give your feedback immediately so know internship about what facts you are talking about 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.360
 to hang 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.630
 the two 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.190
 focus on behavior 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 not on the person 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.850
 not the person as a person is wrong 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.159
 well his way of working it is the fourth so i have on his behavior 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.550
 on performance 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.170
 amerongen 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.280
 the 3 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 the rich to speak for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.030
 make a list with the point in advance and which should definitely be covered 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.340
 the corner with concrete examples 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.820
 tip 4 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.980

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.010
 I think cows are already successful in the ditch 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.870
 but we have and now 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.010

 tip time 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.070

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.270
 listen 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 but what the other person has to say let him respond 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.120
 he also shows that you are listening 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.720
 although only afterwards 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.389

 tip 6 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.159
 search for solutions together 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.430
 that wall the trainees to come to such a solution together he ran 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.659
 tip 7 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.999
 sand over it

 the criticism is given 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.719
 there is a solution in sight 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.039
 sand over it 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.969
