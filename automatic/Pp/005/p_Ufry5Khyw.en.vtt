usual<00:01:24.390> site<00:01:24.750> settings<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.619> probably

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
usual site settings so that probably

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.440 
usual site settings so that probably
means<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> fixed

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
means that this has got a kind of fixed

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
means that this has got a kind of fixed
scope<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> second<00:01:28.829> perk<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
scope but then the second perk this is

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.859 
scope but then the second perk this is
cursed<00:01:30.000> spring<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.509> basically<00:01:30.780> means

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
cursed spring at this basically means

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.330 
cursed spring at this basically means
that<00:01:31.049> precision<00:01:31.439> kills<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.159> weapon

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that precision kills with this weapon

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
that precision kills with this weapon
frequently<00:01:33.119> trigger<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.509> cursed<00:01:33.900> thrall<00:01:34.200> style

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
frequently trigger a cursed thrall style

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380 
frequently trigger a cursed thrall style
explosion<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.729> those<00:01:35.880> crazy<00:01:36.150> ones

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
explosion so you know those crazy ones

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.640 
explosion so you know those crazy ones
that<00:01:36.540> run<00:01:36.630> towards<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.350> detonate

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that run towards you and just detonate

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
that run towards you and just detonate
themselves<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> sort<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> vector<00:01:39.450> when

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
themselves that is a sort of vector when

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
themselves that is a sort of vector when
we<00:01:39.689> getting<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:40.110> getting<00:01:40.530> critical<00:01:40.920> hits

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
we getting from getting critical hits

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
we getting from getting critical hits
with<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.759> precision<00:01:42.090> kills<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
with this or precision kills with it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.060 
with this or precision kills with it
should<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> say<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:43.829> damage

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
should I say you then have your damage

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830 
should I say you then have your damage
upgrades<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.939> usual<00:01:45.149> things<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.479> chaining

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
upgrades the usual things for chaining

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
upgrades the usual things for chaining
stability<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.619> foster<00:01:46.979> reload<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.430> whatnot

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
stability or foster reload and whatnot

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
stability or foster reload and whatnot
and<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.509> rangefinder<00:01:49.170> aiming

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and then you have rangefinder aiming

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
and then you have rangefinder aiming
this<00:01:49.649> weapon<00:01:50.009> increases<00:01:50.460> its<00:01:50.640> effective

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this weapon increases its effective

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
this weapon increases its effective
range<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.290> usual<00:01:52.619> array<00:01:52.799> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
range and then your usual array of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980 
range and then your usual array of
additional<00:01:53.460> damage<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.909> grace<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
additional damage on grace so that is a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.050 
additional damage on grace so that is a
necro<00:01:55.590> chasm<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.310> let's<00:01:56.490> move<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
necro chasm now let's move on to the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.600 
necro chasm now let's move on to the
next<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.360> no<00:01:58.110> land<00:01:58.380> beyond<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
next one no land beyond now this is a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
next one no land beyond now this is a
sniper<00:02:00.299> rifle<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:00.899> makes<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.350> good

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
sniper rifle but what makes this so good

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
sniper rifle but what makes this so good
is<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.950> goes<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.460> primary<00:02:02.969> weapon<00:02:03.270> slot

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
is it goes in your primary weapon slot

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
is it goes in your primary weapon slot
so<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.290> how<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.500> vex<00:02:04.860> mythic<00:02:05.159> lost<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
so just like how the vex mythic lost is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
so just like how the vex mythic lost is
a<00:02:05.579> primary<00:02:05.850> fusion<00:02:06.180> rifle<00:02:06.630> or<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.110> universal

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
a primary fusion rifle or the universal

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.650 
a primary fusion rifle or the universal
remote<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.099> primary<00:02:08.340> shotgun<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
remote is a primary shotgun this is a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.869 
remote is a primary shotgun this is a
primary<00:02:10.170> sniper<00:02:10.619> rifle<00:02:10.950> now<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.640> six

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
primary sniper rifle now it's got six

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.280 
primary sniper rifle now it's got six
rounds<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> magazine<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.930> stability

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
rounds in the magazine and it stability

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.790 
rounds in the magazine and it stability
is<00:02:13.349> quite<00:02:13.530> low

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
is quite low

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.990 
is quite low
so<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.070> message<00:02:14.250> probably<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.910> have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so your message probably going to have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.450 
so your message probably going to have
recoil<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.780> icebreaker<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.190> does

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
recoil like the icebreaker but this does

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.700 
recoil like the icebreaker but this does
mean<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:18.030> carry<00:02:18.330> two<00:02:18.600> sniper<00:02:18.960> rifles<00:02:19.320> it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
mean you can carry two sniper rifles it

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.990 
mean you can carry two sniper rifles it
doesn't<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.040> any<00:02:20.190> elemental<00:02:20.610> damage<00:02:20.700> but

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
doesn't have any elemental damage but

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.340 
doesn't have any elemental damage but
let's<00:02:21.120> take<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.300> look<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.540> what<00:02:21.780> you've<00:02:21.900> got<00:02:22.080> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
let's take a look at what you've got so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.480 
let's take a look at what you've got so
again<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> first<00:02:23.010> column<00:02:23.190> you've<00:02:23.370> got

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
again in the first column you've got

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.250 
again in the first column you've got
your<00:02:23.610> usual<00:02:23.850> array<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> ballistics<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.110> then

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
your usual array of ballistics you then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.720 
your usual array of ballistics you then
have<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.620> mulligan<00:02:25.890> which<00:02:26.280> basically<00:02:26.490> means

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
have a mulligan which basically means

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.340 
have a mulligan which basically means
that<00:02:26.940> if<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.120> miss<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> shot<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.900> has<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> chance

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that if you miss a shot it has a chance

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.200 
that if you miss a shot it has a chance
to<00:02:28.470> return<00:02:28.680> ammo<00:02:29.130> directly<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> magazine

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
to return ammo directly to the magazine

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.940 
to return ammo directly to the magazine
for<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> damage<00:02:31.050> upgrades<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.620> different

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
for the damage upgrades and different

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
for the damage upgrades and different
things<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.370> changing<00:02:32.880> speed<00:02:33.210> agility<00:02:33.450> all

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
things for changing speed agility all

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.240 
things for changing speed agility all
that<00:02:33.870> stuff<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
that stuff like that and you have the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.370 
that stuff like that and you have the
master<00:02:35.460> increased<00:02:36.390> precision<00:02:36.630> damage<00:02:37.020> kills

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
master increased precision damage kills

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.900 
master increased precision damage kills
briefly<00:02:37.770> increased<00:02:38.130> damage<00:02:38.310> against<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
briefly increased damage against the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.310 
briefly increased damage against the
next<00:02:39.090> target<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:39.990> want<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.170> get<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
next target so if you do want to get the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.020 
next target so if you do want to get the
most<00:02:40.470> out<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.890> six<00:02:41.100> round<00:02:41.280> magazine<00:02:41.610> then

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
most out that six round magazine then

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.280 
most out that six round magazine then
you'll<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.330> all<00:02:42.450> these<00:02:42.600> shots<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.050> each<00:02:43.170> of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you'll and all these shots and each of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
you'll and all these shots and each of
them<00:02:43.380> has<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.590> chance<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.040> doing<00:02:44.220> increased

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
them has a chance of doing increased

mouth thing on the end of it anyway so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
mouth thing on the end of it anyway so
as<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.470> said<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> damage<00:02:59.070> really<00:02:59.430> good<00:02:59.550> for

as I said so the damage really good for
that<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.910> then<00:03:00.240> your<00:03:00.540> usual<00:03:00.840> array<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.050> kind

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that one then your usual array of kind

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.900 
that one then your usual array of kind
of<00:03:01.530> control<00:03:01.860> compensators<00:03:02.490> things<00:03:02.700> like<00:03:02.820> that

rounds<00:03:15.540> fired<00:03:15.720> from<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.020> weapon<00:03:16.320> leave<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
rounds fired from this weapon leave a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.800 
rounds fired from this weapon leave a
solar<00:03:17.070> flare<00:03:17.280> upon<00:03:17.700> detonation<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.600> know

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
solar flare upon detonation so you know

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.360 
solar flare upon detonation so you know
that<00:03:18.959> annoying<00:03:19.290> flaming<00:03:19.739> ball<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> wall

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
that annoying flaming ball that the wall

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.040 
that annoying flaming ball that the wall
up<00:03:20.489> stop<00:03:20.700> down<00:03:20.850> yet<00:03:21.150> you'll<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.630> relieved<00:03:21.900> one

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
up stop down yet you'll be relieved one

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.720 
up stop down yet you'll be relieved one
of<00:03:22.140> those<00:03:22.260> when<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.980> fired<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.459> rocket

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
of those when you fired on this rocket

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.100 
of those when you fired on this rocket
so<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.120> going<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.270> be<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.630> good<00:03:24.900> for

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
so this is going to be really good for

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.449 
so this is going to be really good for
crowd<00:03:25.350> control<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.680> really<00:03:25.980> nasty<00:03:26.340> for

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
crowd control and really nasty for

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.560 
crowd control and really nasty for
things<00:03:26.610> like<00:03:26.670> control<00:03:27.180> when<00:03:27.330> you're<00:03:27.420> playing

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
things like control when you're playing

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.380 
things like control when you're playing
in<00:03:27.720> PvP<00:03:28.080> then<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> 347<00:03:29.820> Vesta

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
in PvP then you have the 347 Vesta

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.050 
in PvP then you have the 347 Vesta
dynasty<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.320> this<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:32.160> scout<00:03:32.670> rifle<00:03:32.820> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
dynasty so this is a scout rifle it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.280 
dynasty so this is a scout rifle it
doesn't<00:03:33.270> have<00:03:33.360> any<00:03:33.510> elements<00:03:33.870> attached<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.200> it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
doesn't have any elements attached to it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.720 
doesn't have any elements attached to it
so<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.770> standard<00:03:35.070> kinetic<00:03:35.459> damage

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
so it's just a standard kinetic damage

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030 
so it's just a standard kinetic damage
scout<00:03:36.000> rifle<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.780> has<00:03:37.020> 19<00:03:37.680> rounds<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
scout rifle but it has 19 rounds in the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.190 
scout rifle but it has 19 rounds in the
magazine<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:39.000> got<00:03:39.209> relatively<00:03:39.690> fast<00:03:39.900> reload

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
magazine it's got relatively fast reload

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.660 
magazine it's got relatively fast reload
rate<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.680> rate<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.860> fire<00:03:41.100> isn't<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.459> high

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
rate the rate of fire isn't that high

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.000 
rate the rate of fire isn't that high
and<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.150> impact<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.720> about<00:03:43.020> mid<00:03:43.260> range<00:03:43.500> now

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and the impact is about mid range now

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.080 
and the impact is about mid range now
again<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.370> first<00:03:44.580> color<00:03:44.730> you've<00:03:44.880> got<00:03:44.970> your

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
again the first color you've got your

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.460 
again the first color you've got your
usual<00:03:45.270> array<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.450> ballistics<00:03:45.930> as<00:03:46.050> opposed<00:03:46.320> to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
usual array of ballistics as opposed to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.470 
usual array of ballistics as opposed to
the<00:03:46.560> scopes<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.580> then<00:03:47.730> have<00:03:47.760> Goliath<00:03:48.300> which

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the scopes you then have Goliath which

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.729 
the scopes you then have Goliath which
means<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.780> non-precision<00:03:49.410> kills

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
means that non-precision kills

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.500 
means that non-precision kills
temporarily<00:03:50.280> increase<00:03:50.700> almost<00:03:51.120> at<00:03:51.239> 4<00:03:51.390> 15

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
temporarily increase almost at 4 15

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.240 
temporarily increase almost at 4 15
seconds<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:52.620> really<00:03:52.890> really<00:03:53.040> good

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
seconds so this is really really good

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.800

under those or high pressure situations

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.840 
under those or high pressure situations
then<00:03:55.440> below<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.680> you've<00:03:55.980> got<00:03:56.160> David<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:56.730> this

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
then below that you've got David so this

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.100

has got David and Goliath which is

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.720 
has got David and Goliath which is
interesting<00:03:58.470> David<00:03:59.160> precision<00:03:59.550> kills

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
interesting David precision kills

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.520 
interesting David precision kills
temporarily<00:04:00.090> increase<00:04:00.420> agility<00:04:00.570> stat<00:04:01.110> for<00:04:01.290> 15

have<00:05:16.290> things<00:05:16.410> like<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.040> this<00:05:17.220> could<00:05:17.340> be

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
have things like that so this could be

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.580 
have things like that so this could be
useful<00:05:17.550> for<00:05:17.700> that<00:05:17.880> but<00:05:18.420> this<00:05:18.660> has<00:05:18.900> five<00:05:19.320> rounds

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
useful for that but this has five rounds

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.620

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
now the fact that you're already dealing

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.070 
now the fact that you're already dealing
side<00:05:41.760> of<00:05:41.880> damage<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.690> have<00:05:42.840> bonus
