about steroids and prosthetics even
though<00:00:15.540> these<00:00:15.690> two<00:00:15.900> things<00:00:16.049> don't<00:00:16.320> really

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
though these two things don't really

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500 
though these two things don't really
necessarily<00:00:16.650> go<00:00:17.250> together<00:00:17.359> they're<00:00:18.359> both

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
necessarily go together they're both

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.720 
necessarily go together they're both
relevant<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.770> skeletal<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.520> muscular

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
relevant to the skeletal and muscular

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.120 
relevant to the skeletal and muscular
systems<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.840> systems<00:00:22.260> recovering<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:22.980> now

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
systems the systems recovering right now

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
systems the systems recovering right now
so<00:00:23.730> i<00:00:23.789> went<00:00:23.970> ahead<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.269> kind<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.630> put<00:00:25.230> them

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so i went ahead and kind of put them

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
so i went ahead and kind of put them
together<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.800> sort<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> lecture<00:00:26.580> where<00:00:26.880> we

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
together in sort of a lecture where we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
together in sort of a lecture where we
could<00:00:27.150> learn<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.689> bit<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:28.050> each<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
could learn a little bit about each of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.709 
could learn a little bit about each of
them

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.930 

now<00:00:35.719> steroids<00:00:36.260> are<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.469> synthetic<00:00:37.250> substance

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
now steroids are a synthetic substance

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.720 
now steroids are a synthetic substance
meaning<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.690> it's<00:00:38.899> man-made<00:00:39.489> there<00:00:40.489> are<00:00:40.550> two

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
meaning that it's man-made there are two

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.340 
meaning that it's man-made there are two
main<00:00:40.909> types<00:00:41.149> or<00:00:41.510> categories<00:00:41.539> that<00:00:42.109> we're

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
main types or categories that we're

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.619 
main types or categories that we're
going<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.500> cover<00:00:42.769> one<00:00:43.219> is<00:00:43.339> anabolic<00:00:44.030> steroids

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
going to cover one is anabolic steroids

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.110 
going to cover one is anabolic steroids
um<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:45.890> type<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.100> steroids<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:47.030> are

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
used to build body tissue so when you

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.819 
used to build body tissue so when you
think<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.269> athletes<00:00:50.809> who<00:00:51.019> abuse<00:00:51.500> steroids

and of course male is becoming more
feminine<00:01:49.009> in<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:49.340> case<00:01:49.549> what<00:01:49.729> I'm<00:01:49.820> referring

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
feminine in this case what I'm referring

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.450 
feminine in this case what I'm referring
to<00:01:50.329> is<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.630> fact<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.649> lot<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.009> times<00:01:52.250> men

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530 

now<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:04.740> totally<00:02:05.430> switching<00:02:05.850> gears<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
now we're totally switching gears and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.979 
now we're totally switching gears and
switching<00:02:06.900> over<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.250> prosthetics<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
switching over to prosthetics this is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.059 
switching over to prosthetics this is
some<00:02:10.770> sort<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.130> artificial<00:02:11.640> body<00:02:12.150> part<00:02:12.569> and

some sort of artificial body part and

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.930 
some sort of artificial body part and
there's<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.130> variety<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.520> reasons<00:02:14.610> that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
there's a variety of reasons that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.690
