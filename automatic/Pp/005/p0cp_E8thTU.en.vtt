that<00:03:16.959> requires<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.410> lot<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.650> people<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.040> kill

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
that requires a lot of people to kill

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.860 
that requires a lot of people to kill
and<00:03:18.519> it's<00:03:18.970> split<00:03:19.180> up<00:03:19.269> into<00:03:19.420> six<00:03:19.660> different

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and it's split up into six different

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.630 
and it's split up into six different
parts<00:03:20.380> it's<00:03:20.799> definitely<00:03:21.160> something<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.430> you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
parts it's definitely something that you

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.710 
parts it's definitely something that you
would<00:03:21.760> want<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.000> mention<00:03:22.180> an<00:03:22.420> update

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
would want to mention an update

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.570 
would want to mention an update
highlights<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.380> I'm<00:03:23.470> pretty<00:03:23.709> surprised<00:03:24.190> that

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
highlights so I'm pretty surprised that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.699 
highlights so I'm pretty surprised that
they<00:03:24.700> didn't<00:03:24.970> mention<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.350> leads<00:03:26.560> me

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
they didn't mention it so this leads me

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.900 
they didn't mention it so this leads me
to<00:03:26.860> believe<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.160> they're<00:03:27.519> not<00:03:27.610> going<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.850> be

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
to believe that they're not going to be

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.250 
to believe that they're not going to be
releasing<00:03:28.209> packet<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.989> global

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
maplestory but I really hope they do

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.910 
maplestory but I really hope they do
actually<00:03:31.720> release<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.410> because<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.709> sounds

Mercedes<00:04:24.290> skills<00:04:24.590> thrown<00:04:24.890> in<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.700> doesn't

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
Mercedes skills thrown in so it doesn't

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.520 
Mercedes skills thrown in so it doesn't
feel<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.180> original<00:04:26.870> but<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.080> still<00:04:27.320> like<00:04:27.470> the
