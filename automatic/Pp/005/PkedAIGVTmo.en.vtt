a<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.949> bleeding<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> long<00:00:26.550> time<00:00:26.789> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
races but apart from that they will be

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
races but apart from that they will be
the<00:01:12.900> five<00:01:13.110> main<00:01:13.500> support<00:01:14.070> categories<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.820> the

the five main support categories for the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
season this year right let's next go

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
season this year right let's next go
onto<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> tracks<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.900> racing<00:01:19.140> out

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
onto the tracks they will be racing out

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.390 
onto the tracks they will be racing out
in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> Pro<00:01:19.860> Touring<00:01:20.159> Car<00:01:20.369> Championship

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
in the Pro Touring Car Championship

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
in the Pro Touring Car Championship
because<00:01:21.360> every<00:01:22.110> year<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.500> changed

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
because every year they have changed

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
because every year they have changed
something<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.640> there's<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:23.970> different

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
something or there's some different

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.410 
something or there's some different
people<00:01:24.960> coming<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> sport<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.009> whatever

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
people coming to the sport or whatever

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.399 
people coming to the sport or whatever
but<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> pretty<00:01:28.320> much

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
but I think this time is pretty much

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
but I think this time is pretty much
exactly<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.890> same<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.280> last<00:01:29.490> year<00:01:29.729> we're

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
exactly the same as last year we're

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
exactly the same as last year we're

touched<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.869> game<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.710> think

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
touched a lot of game but I think

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
touched a lot of game but I think
overall<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.030> probably<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.479> best<00:02:09.539> circuit

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
overall it's probably the best circuit

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.380 
overall it's probably the best circuit
on<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> calendar<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:11.819> rocking<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
on the calendar but I think rocking is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
on the calendar but I think rocking is
pretty<00:02:12.660> good<00:02:12.780> track<00:02:12.959> as<00:02:13.140> well<00:02:13.319> so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
pretty good track as well so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.400 
pretty good track as well so
