before<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:01.319> go<00:00:01.469> on<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.709> want<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.340> about<00:00:02.550> a

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
before we go on I want to talk about a

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.869 
before we go on I want to talk about a
central<00:00:03.780> concept<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.589> customizing<00:00:05.520> weapon

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
central concept of customizing weapon

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.760 
central concept of customizing weapon
that<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> definition<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.109> target<00:00:07.529> for

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
that is the definition of a target for

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.009 
that is the definition of a target for
an<00:00:07.890> action<00:00:08.280> almost<00:00:08.550> every<00:00:09.300> action<00:00:09.480> refers<00:00:09.990> to

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
an action almost every action refers to

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.919 
an action almost every action refers to
a<00:00:10.200> specific<00:00:10.650> element<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> page<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.929> you

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
a specific element on a page and you

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.120 
a specific element on a page and you
must<00:00:13.200> tell<00:00:13.500> customize<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.429> web<00:00:14.690> for<00:00:15.690> which

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
must tell customize the web for which

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.929 
must tell customize the web for which
for<00:00:17.130> which<00:00:17.310> element<00:00:17.940> an<00:00:18.359> action<00:00:18.810> should<00:00:18.990> apply

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
for which element an action should apply

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.880 
for which element an action should apply
so<00:00:20.939> let's<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> look<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.230> define<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
so let's have a look we define a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.109 
so let's have a look we define a
shortcut<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.880> button<00:00:25.820> for<00:00:26.820> every

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
shortcut for this button for every

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.130 
shortcut for this button for every
action<00:00:27.590> which<00:00:28.590> refers<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:29.760> target<00:00:30.179> element

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
action which refers to an target element

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
action which refers to an target element
there<00:00:31.830> will<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.160> group<00:00:32.369> box<00:00:32.579> within<00:00:32.940> its

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
there will be a group box within its

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
there will be a group box within its
edit<00:00:33.930> dialog<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.840> within<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> screw<00:00:37.320> box<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
edit dialog and within the screw box you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.310 
edit dialog and within the screw box you
define<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.879> target<00:00:39.540> element<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.170> there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
define the the target element and there

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
define the the target element and there
are<00:00:40.440> two<00:00:40.649> ways<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.920> define<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.850> target<00:00:42.059> element

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
are two ways to define a target element

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.560 
are two ways to define a target element
two<00:00:43.200> styles<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.160> simple<00:00:44.579> style<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
two styles there's a simple style the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.650 
two styles there's a simple style the
simple<00:00:45.899> style<00:00:46.190> simply<00:00:47.190> consists<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> list

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
simple style simply consists of a list

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
simple style simply consists of a list
of<00:00:48.899> name<00:00:49.410> value<00:00:49.680> pairs<00:00:50.100> where<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> first<00:00:51.000> name

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of name value pairs where the first name

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
of name value pairs where the first name
will<00:00:51.449> appear<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.800> tag<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> tag<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
will appear is the tag and the tag in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
will appear is the tag and the tag in
this<00:00:56.550> case<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:56.969> an<00:00:57.090> input<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.840> be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this case it's an input it will be

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
this case it's an input it will be
automatically<00:00:58.800> proposed<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> don't<00:00:59.940> have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
automatically proposed so you don't have

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
automatically proposed so you don't have
to<00:01:00.180> worry<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.590> rest<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to worry about that and the rest of it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060 
to worry about that and the rest of it
is<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.090> list<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> attributes<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.860> well

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
is the list of attributes and it's well

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
is the list of attributes and it's well
use<00:01:07.010> if<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.390> change<00:01:09.390> anything<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.020> get

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
use if you change anything you will get

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
use if you change anything you will get
an<00:01:10.320> instant<00:01:10.710> feedback<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.720> off<00:01:13.760> of<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
an instant feedback and off of the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
an instant feedback and off of the
result<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> which<00:01:16.170> elements<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> current

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
result to which elements the current

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.510 
result to which elements the current
expression<00:01:18.090> matches<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
expression matches and you see now it's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.330 
expression matches and you see now it's
not<00:01:21.090> valid<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.710> expression<00:01:23.130> has<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
not valid because the expression has a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.240 
not valid because the expression has a
non<00:01:23.549> unique<00:01:23.850> result<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.590> also<00:01:25.830> an

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
non unique result you have also an

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
non unique result you have also an
autocomplete<00:01:27.030> feature<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> press

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
autocomplete feature if you press

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.510 
autocomplete feature if you press
control<00:01:28.590> space<00:01:29.689> you<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.520> selection

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
control space you get in the selection

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.420 
control space you get in the selection
of<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:33.090> attribute<00:01:33.720> value<00:01:34.590> pairs<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:35.280> are

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
of all attribute value pairs which are

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.490 
of all attribute value pairs which are
available<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.119> element<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:37.320> the

available for that element for the
selected<00:01:37.920> element<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> let's<00:01:40.770> say<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.189> take<00:01:41.430> we

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
selected element so let's say we take we

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.880 
selected element so let's say we take we
take<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.630> search

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
take this one search

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.150 
take this one search
we<00:01:45.520> still<00:01:45.760> have<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.000> non-unique<00:01:46.540> result<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.560> now

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
we still have a non-unique result so now

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.270 
we still have a non-unique result so now
we<00:01:48.220> have<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.820> narrow<00:01:49.030> this<00:01:49.360> by<00:01:49.600> saying

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we have to narrow this by saying

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.680 
we have to narrow this by saying
position<00:01:51.280> 1<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.900> now<00:01:52.900> we<00:01:53.320> have<00:01:53.500> an<00:01:54.690> everything

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
position 1 and now we have an everything

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.330 
position 1 and now we have an everything
is<00:01:55.780> alright<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:56.260> have<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.560> define<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> short

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
is alright we have to define a short

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.219 
is alright we have to define a short
string<00:01:57.580> here<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.510> get<00:01:58.690> all<00:01:59.640> necessary<00:02:01.229> form

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
string here to get all necessary form

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.990 
string here to get all necessary form
elements<00:02:02.979> filled<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.460> we<00:02:04.150> can<00:02:04.360> confirm<00:02:04.570> that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
elements filled and we can confirm that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.510 
elements filled and we can confirm that
let's<00:02:07.000> reopen<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.170> second<00:02:08.500> way<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.950> define

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
let's reopen it the second way to define

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.330 
let's reopen it the second way to define
a<00:02:09.880> target<00:02:10.270> element<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.800> enter<00:02:12.160> a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
a target element is you can enter a

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.420 
a target element is you can enter a
valid<00:02:12.850> XPath<00:02:13.660> expression<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.160> case

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
valid XPath expression and in this case

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.760 
valid XPath expression and in this case
also<00:02:16.030> customize<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.959> web<00:02:17.200> offers<00:02:17.470> you

also customize the web offers you

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.380 
also customize the web offers you
variety<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.459> choices<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.420> take<00:02:20.020> one<00:02:20.260> from

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
variety of choices you can take one from

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.500 
variety of choices you can take one from
and<00:02:22.390> let's<00:02:22.600> say<00:02:22.750> let's<00:02:23.080> say<00:02:23.380> we<00:02:23.590> take<00:02:23.770> this<00:02:23.980> one
