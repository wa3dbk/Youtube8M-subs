I'm<00:01:09.280> going<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.580> shoot<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.940> missile<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.509> put

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
I'm going to shoot the missile you put

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.460 
I'm going to shoot the missile you put
it<00:01:10.900> in<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:14.170> pump<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.950> all<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.540> way<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:16.990> then

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
it in you pump it all the way and then

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.639 
it in you pump it all the way and then
this<00:01:17.830> happens<00:01:18.399> it<00:01:19.270> doesn't<00:01:20.080> go<00:01:20.290> all<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.619> way

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
this happens it doesn't go all the way

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.999 
this happens it doesn't go all the way
because<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.240> pull<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:22.869> push<00:01:23.800> it

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
because when you pull this push it

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.520 
because when you pull this push it
forward<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.860> shoots<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.930> that's<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.350> one

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
forward it shoots I think that's the one

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.480 
forward it shoots I think that's the one
let's<00:01:29.800> go<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:33.310> it

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
let's go with it

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
let's go with it
oh<00:01:33.610> I<00:01:33.970> think

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.920 

I'm<00:01:41.470> gonna<00:01:41.830> find<00:01:42.220> my<00:01:42.460> walk<00:01:42.700> into<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:43.180> because

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
I'm gonna find my walk into that because

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.320 
I'm gonna find my walk into that because
before<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.860> was<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.220> fail<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.540> pump<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
before it was it fail so you pump it you

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.770 
before it was it fail so you pump it you
put<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:49.990> in<00:01:50.260> all<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:51.400> way<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:54.780> now

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
put it in all the way and then you now
