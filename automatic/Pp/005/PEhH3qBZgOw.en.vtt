00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the streets of Paris it's I think it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.550 
the streets of Paris it's I think it's
just<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> way<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> city<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.049> created

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
just the way that the city is created

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
just the way that the city is created
because<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.820> walk<00:01:36.060> everywhere

you need to go in Los Angeles you just

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670
