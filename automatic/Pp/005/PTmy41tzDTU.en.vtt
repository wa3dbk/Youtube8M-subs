00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Now I want to give your 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.210
 Attention to the review of the first serial 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 heavy German tank is-6 tiger 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.799
 the tank has a very good heavy 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.460
 armor but unfortunately due to the fact that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.340
 missing tilt angles this armor 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.130
 square enough and its on medium 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.320
 distances even break through 76 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.109
 millimeter projectile but on the far 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.740
 the distances are pretty good this armor 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 holds 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 shells now I'll show you 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.070
 all the characteristics of this tank and show 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.570
 how he acts in battle against these 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 three tanks we have here m42 folding screen 75 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.489
 millimeter gun of his elder 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 fellow m43 with 76 millimeter guns and 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:59.489
 his younger brother is a pc5 panther with 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:05.960
 such a distance the projectile is unlikely to strike 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.960
 from the first shot here the projectile failed 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.400
 Naturally, the top armor plate which 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.439
 well armored not well enough 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 breaks from such a distance 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.610
 if you drive closer without difficulty 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 the shell will enter the frontal projection of the tank 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.549
 more or less average distance armor 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.040
 keeps hitting quite well but to 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.670
 Unfortunately, not very long and now with this 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.799
 close enough distance 75 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.700
 millimeter shell pierces 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 heavy tiger armor well naturally 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.890
 no one will be surprised by the fact that the board 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.280
 tiger pierce almost any trunks 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.320
 because there is no reservation here and any 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.990
 entering the engine area or 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 fuel tanks will cause the tiger 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.820
 just burn out and now we move on to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.930
 the main advantage of our tiger and this 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.939
 to his 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.700
 great tool that pierces 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.250
 on average distance almost any 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.630
 enemy tank 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.570
 So we have here m4a m43 2 Sherman Sherman 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.100
 and German panther 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.410
 easily from the projectile punches 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.680
 Sherman who incidentally the first 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.990
 the review kept well punch from thing but 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.640
 pieces could 75 millimeter gun and 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.920
 tiger we have a much larger caliber 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.130
 we shoot at panther and impenetrable by 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.320
 the fact that the shell hit the tower now 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.800
 I'll try to shoot a frontal projection and 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.380
 frontal projection stitched easily and 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.030
 broke through which led to 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.900
 fire panther 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.520
 Well, what can we say about the projectile 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.440
 will make m4a 3 sherman who is just not 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.860
 greatly increased armor compared to 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.110
 his younger brother what else can 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.959
 add about this tanchik unfolds 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.900
 on the spot he is quite cheerfully soft 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.340
 speaking very cheerfully but here are the dynamic 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.930
 characteristics of him like any 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.860
 another heavy tank is enough 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.380
 He goes slow but hard 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.080
 tank and do not need to quickly for this 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.049
 medium tanks mouth in general you can 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.390
 quietly sum up about this 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.049
 tank what good is in him 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.230
 magnificent frontal armor is on 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.040
 long distance keeps kick from 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.890
 trunks 75-76 millimeter one to 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.110
 Sorry in the close range of his armor 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.810
 does not save him 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.940
 he has a gorgeous 88 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.920
 millimeter cannon which pierces 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.600
 virtually any tank through and through 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.560
 he has a strong enough tower 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.700
 which can hold shells and he 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.130
 very good turnover on the spot but 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.400
 like any other heavy tank 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.530
 very mediocre agility that's in 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.500
 In general, all that can be said about this 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.510
 tank and by the way he is very often 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.340
 burns any hit in 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.269
 fuel tank power and engines 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.959
 inevitably goes to fire this 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.400
 tank any abandoned him here 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.500
 Molotov cocktail either from 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.419
 anti - tank grenades and will cause 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.419
 that the tank will burn alive
