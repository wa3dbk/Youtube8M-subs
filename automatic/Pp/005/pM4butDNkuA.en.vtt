00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.090 
how I even played modern warfare 3 for
like<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.819> whole<00:02:20.150> year<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.500> computer<00:02:21.830> and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
like a whole year on that computer and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.750 
like a whole year on that computer and
still<00:02:22.459> somehow<00:02:22.790> produce<00:02:23.569> videos<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:25.490> when

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
still somehow produce videos and when

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.309 
still somehow produce videos and when
ever<00:02:26.180> since<00:02:26.420> I've<00:02:26.540> gotten<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.840> new<00:02:26.990> computer

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
ever since I've gotten this new computer

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.020 
ever since I've gotten this new computer
I've<00:02:27.380> been<00:02:27.500> contemplating<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.430> return<00:02:28.760> early

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
I've been contemplating the return early

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.230 
I've been contemplating the return early
which<00:02:29.209> was<00:02:29.240> real<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.730> just<00:02:31.730> let<00:02:31.940> let<00:02:32.090> me<00:02:32.150> to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
which was real and just let let me to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.890 
which was real and just let let me to
this<00:02:32.360> day<00:02:32.800> now<00:02:33.800> my<00:02:33.950> second<00:02:34.490> reason<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.120> which

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
this day now my second reason and which

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.080 
this day now my second reason and which
is<00:02:36.050> probably<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.500> very<00:02:36.860> very<00:02:37.130> very<00:02:37.280> big<00:02:37.700> reason

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
is probably a very very very big reason

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.600 
is probably a very very very big reason
is<00:02:38.270> cuz<00:02:38.660> i'm<00:02:39.020> pretty<00:02:39.290> much<00:02:39.380> banned<00:02:39.890> from<00:02:40.220> every
