these are flip based so placing your
phone<00:03:39.340> facedown<00:03:39.730> or<00:03:40.239> picking<00:03:41.170> up<00:03:41.260> when<00:03:41.560> it's

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
phone facedown or picking up when it's

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.590 
phone facedown or picking up when it's
ringing<00:03:41.920> will<00:03:42.220> obviously<00:03:42.670> take<00:03:43.060> different

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
ringing will obviously take different

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.290 
ringing will obviously take different
actions

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.170 

we<00:03:46.690> have<00:03:47.230> one-handed<00:03:47.710> operation<00:03:48.000> which<00:03:49.000> we

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
we have one-handed operation which we

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.480 
we have one-handed operation which we
also<00:03:49.360> saw<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.620> you'll<00:03:50.770> see<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.040> one-handed

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
also saw so you'll see the one-handed

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.240 
also saw so you'll see the one-handed
keyboard<00:03:52.150> will<00:03:52.540> shrink<00:03:53.440> up<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.800> head<00:03:54.010> to

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
keyboard will shrink up and head to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.270 
keyboard will shrink up and head to
either<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.880> left<00:03:55.060> or<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.270> right<00:03:56.160> what<00:03:57.160> else

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
either the left or the right what else

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.840 
either the left or the right what else
do<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:58.690> have<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:59.620> power<00:04:00.340> saving<00:04:00.550> mode

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
do we have we have a power saving mode

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.940 
do we have we have a power saving mode
it's<00:04:01.090> not<00:04:01.300> as<00:04:01.420> advanced<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.320> one<00:04:02.470> say<00:04:02.740> on

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
it's not as advanced as the one say on

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.810 
it's not as advanced as the one say on
the<00:04:03.160> galaxy<00:04:03.700> s5<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.320> will<00:04:05.500> obviously<00:04:05.820> you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
the galaxy s5 but it will obviously you

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.760 
the galaxy s5 but it will obviously you
can<00:04:06.940> set<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> level<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:10.110> once<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.410> kicks

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
can set a level for it and once it kicks

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.790 
can set a level for it and once it kicks
in<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.460> then<00:04:12.670> limit<00:04:13.090> which<00:04:13.710> aspects<00:04:14.710> of

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
in you can then limit which aspects of

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.530 
in you can then limit which aspects of
the<00:04:14.890> phone<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.310> can<00:04:15.550> turn<00:04:15.850> also<00:04:16.180> obviously

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
the phone you can turn also obviously

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.449 
the phone you can turn also obviously
the<00:04:16.600> usual<00:04:17.110> connectivity<00:04:17.680> things<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.160> screen

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
the usual connectivity things and screen

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.370 
the usual connectivity things and screen
brightness<00:04:18.700> etc<00:04:21.570> there's<00:04:22.570> a<00:04:22.660> smart<00:04:22.900> cleaning

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
brightness etc there's a smart cleaning

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.720 
brightness etc there's a smart cleaning
option<00:04:23.650> in<00:04:23.800> here<00:04:23.950> as<00:04:24.040> well<00:04:24.160> which<00:04:24.370> isn't<00:04:24.520> just

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
option in here as well which isn't just

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.060 
option in here as well which isn't just
like<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.720> task<00:04:25.990> Killough<00:04:26.380> which<00:04:26.680> we<00:04:26.830> all<00:04:26.950> know

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
like a task Killough which we all know

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.350 
like a task Killough which we all know
it<00:04:27.130> doesn't<00:04:27.280> really<00:04:27.460> do<00:04:27.790> anything

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
it doesn't really do anything

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.300 
it doesn't really do anything
but<00:04:28.900> it<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.080> also<00:04:29.200> clear<00:04:29.590> out<00:04:29.740> your<00:04:29.890> download

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
but it can also clear out your download

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.740 
but it can also clear out your download
folder<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.730> temporary<00:04:31.060> files<00:04:31.330> which<00:04:31.570> is

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
folder and temporary files which is

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.550 
folder and temporary files which is
actually<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.230> really<00:04:32.380> nice<00:04:32.620> option<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.790> have

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
actually a really nice option to have

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.080 
actually a really nice option to have
and<00:04:35.560> what<00:04:35.860> else<00:04:36.010> do<00:04:36.100> you<00:04:36.190> know<00:04:36.310> chill<00:04:36.760> window

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
use in your quick circle case if you

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.270 
use in your quick circle case if you
offer<00:06:11.130> that<00:06:11.280> that's<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.819> circular<00:06:12.389> cutout

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280

around the internet so you can choose
your<00:06:17.160> apps<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.759> access<00:06:18.090> through<00:06:18.270> that<00:06:18.479> as<00:06:18.660> well

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
your apps to access through that as well

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.520 
your apps to access through that as well
and<00:06:19.560> that's<00:06:20.490> pretty<00:06:20.970> much<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.319> let's<00:06:22.319> have<00:06:22.440> a

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:32.159 
cam mode analysis turn that off so it's

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.219 
cam mode analysis turn that off so it's
quite<00:06:32.310> a<00:06:32.370> minimal<00:06:32.789> design<00:06:33.229> everything's

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
quite a minimal design everything's

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.749 
quite a minimal design everything's
being<00:06:34.500> made<00:06:34.800> a<00:06:34.830> little<00:06:35.159> bit<00:06:35.340> more<00:06:35.490> transparent

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
being made a little bit more transparent

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.270 
being made a little bit more transparent
than<00:06:36.240> it<00:06:36.419> used<00:06:36.630> to<00:06:36.690> be<00:06:36.780> on<00:06:36.960> the<00:06:37.050> g2<00:06:37.380> and<00:06:37.680> there's

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
than it used to be on the g2 and there's

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.629 
than it used to be on the g2 and there's
a<00:06:38.630> super-clean<00:06:39.630> view<00:06:40.190> where<00:06:41.190> you'll<00:06:41.340> have<00:06:41.490> no

LG<00:06:53.009> developed<00:06:53.430> to<00:06:54.030> measure<00:06:54.180> the<00:06:54.449> distance<00:06:54.860> so

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
LG developed to measure the distance so

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.659 
LG developed to measure the distance so
it<00:06:56.400> allows<00:06:56.820> for<00:06:57.060> super<00:06:57.389> super<00:06:57.659> fast<00:06:57.810> autofocus

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
it allows for super super fast autofocus

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.950 
it allows for super super fast autofocus
