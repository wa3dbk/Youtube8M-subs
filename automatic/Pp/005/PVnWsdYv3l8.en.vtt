bottom<00:03:28.870> string<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:30.430> also<00:03:30.579> do<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.030> B

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
bottom string and you also do the B

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.399 
bottom string and you also do the B
string

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.319 

we<00:03:36.409> switch<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.799> b-minor<00:03:37.189> and<00:03:37.489> it's<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.120> same

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
we switch to a b-minor and it's the same

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.910 
we switch to a b-minor and it's the same
thing<00:03:38.540> except<00:03:38.840> instead<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.170> playing<00:03:39.379> the<00:03:39.739> top

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
thing except instead of playing the top

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.599 
thing except instead of playing the top
string<00:03:40.189> you<00:03:40.999> do<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.599> string<00:03:41.989> on<00:03:42.109> that<00:03:42.319> first

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
string you do the a string on that first

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:54.190 
string you do the a string on that first
pick<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.739> far<00:03:48.859> you<00:03:48.920> get<00:03:50.319> B<00:03:51.319> minor<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:53.200> put

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
pick so so far you get B minor and put

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.069 
pick so so far you get B minor and put
the<00:03:54.260> C<00:03:54.439> you<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.739> same<00:03:54.889> picking<00:03:55.780> but<00:03:56.780> here

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
the C you to the same picking but here

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.190 
the C you to the same picking but here
you<00:03:57.319> change<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.629> right<00:03:59.629> before<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.959> pluck

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
you change and right before you pluck

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.599 
you change and right before you pluck
the<00:04:00.379> bottom<00:04:00.709> string<00:04:00.919> you<00:04:01.040> put<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.400> finger

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
the bottom string you put this finger

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.589 
the bottom string you put this finger
down<00:04:01.849> on<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.150> third<00:04:02.389> fret<00:04:03.639> high<00:04:04.639> E<00:04:04.669> string<00:04:04.909> and

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
down on the third fret high E string and

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.550 
down on the third fret high E string and
then<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.319> put<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:07.010> ago<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.200> do<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.409> for

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
then you put in ago that you do that for

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.860 
then you put in ago that you do that for
every<00:04:09.739> time<00:04:09.919> you<00:04:10.010> play<00:04:10.159> C<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.639> yet<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.780> go

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
every time you play C so yet then you go

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.569 
every time you play C so yet then you go
back<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.199> gene<00:04:18.380> with<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:19.099> picking<00:04:19.400> which

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
back to the gene with the picking which

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.409 
back to the gene with the picking which
is<00:04:19.729> with<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.180> top<00:04:20.630> string<00:04:21.849> go<00:04:22.849> back<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.210> C

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
is with the top string go back to the C

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.390 
is with the top string go back to the C
do<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.720> same<00:04:23.930> thing<00:04:23.960> from<00:04:24.770> before<00:04:24.919> where<00:04:25.280> you

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
do that same thing from before where you

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.909 
do that same thing from before where you
put<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.539> pinky<00:04:26.810> down<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:30.139> for<00:04:30.289> this<00:04:30.410> you<00:04:30.590> go

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
put that pinky down and for this you go

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.800 
put that pinky down and for this you go
it's<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.520> G<00:04:34.030> ok<00:04:36.550> but<00:04:37.550> what<00:04:37.759> you<00:04:37.880> do<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.660> go

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
it's a G ok but what you do is you go

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.490 
it's a G ok but what you do is you go
the<00:04:39.470> low<00:04:39.770> E<00:04:39.949> string<00:04:41.139> then<00:04:42.139> you<00:04:42.169> check<00:04:42.380> these

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
the low E string then you check these

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.050 
the low E string then you check these
bottom<00:04:42.889> three<00:04:43.099> strings<00:04:43.159> with<00:04:43.610> these<00:04:43.789> three

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
bottom three strings with these three

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.640 
bottom three strings with these three
fingers<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.419> go<00:04:45.280> I'll<00:04:46.280> say<00:04:46.669> it<00:04:46.729> up<00:04:47.530> do<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
fingers and go I'll say it up do the

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.830 
fingers and go I'll say it up do the
same<00:04:48.830> thing<00:04:49.009> on<00:04:49.099> an<00:04:49.190> E<00:04:49.370> minor<00:04:49.570> which<00:04:50.570> is<00:04:50.630> that

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
same thing on an E minor which is that

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.659 
same thing on an E minor which is that
one<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:54.440> yet<00:04:55.599> you<00:04:56.860> go<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.919> an<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.280> do<00:04:58.520> that

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
one so yet you go to an a you do that

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.260 
one so yet you go to an a you do that
pick<00:04:58.909> that<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.180> did<00:04:59.419> for<00:04:59.599> the<00:04:59.690> see

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.110 

and<00:05:03.080> for<00:05:03.259> the<00:05:03.490> d7<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:05.870> that<00:05:06.050> but<00:05:06.349> with<00:05:06.530> the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
and for the d7 you do that but with the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.010 
and for the d7 you do that but with the
fourth<00:05:08.120> string<00:05:08.419> and<00:05:08.479> sort<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> string

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020

the same time then you do the B string

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.260 
the same time then you do the B string
and<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:46.849> g<00:05:46.880> string<00:05:48.400> then<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.490> go<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.759> D

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
and the g string then you go to the D

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.439 
and the g string then you go to the D
seventh<00:05:50.659> chord<00:05:51.729> and<00:05:52.729> you<00:05:53.120> get<00:05:55.180> see<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.240> do<00:05:56.360> the

seventh chord and you get see you do the

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.010 
seventh chord and you get see you do the
D<00:05:56.599> string<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:58.180> one<00:05:59.180> two<00:05:59.419> or<00:05:59.509> three<00:05:59.690> strands<00:06:02.020> go

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
D string and one two or three strands go

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.620 
D string and one two or three strands go
to<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.199> G<00:06:03.380> shape<00:06:03.590> and<00:06:04.220> and<00:06:04.550> do<00:06:05.210> that<00:06:05.360> same

D seventh except instead of the top

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.249 
D seventh except instead of the top
string<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:10.639> do<00:06:10.759> the<00:06:10.940> fourth<00:06:11.300> string<00:06:11.539> right
