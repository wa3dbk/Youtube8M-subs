 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.320
 Indispensable smartphones for our lives 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.670
 However, we know that this smartphone is generating an electromagnetic wave that adversely affects the human body 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.860
 Do you have 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:37.280
 As much as possible refrain from the child's child-like under the age of 16 in some countries of the technology in Europe 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:42.530
 It is recommended to use in spray as far as possible from the abdomen 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.219
 It is written in the manual of mobile phone companies to use the mobile phone as far as possible from the body. 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.500
 I am 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:53.040
 Who also has the potential for carcinogenic risk from cell phones and smartphones 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.340
 Warning and we recommend that you take precautionary measures of range teeth 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.650
 It can be said that such a suburb of the 21st century 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.350
 I made a product that protects you from the problem of electromagnetic waves 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:11.710
 The funeral's electromagnetic wave absorption case absorbs harmful electromagnetic waves in the direction of 360 degrees. 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:18.340
 It has a revolutionary new technology that converts and dissipates a small amount of heat 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:21.880
 This is an experiment with equipment that generates the same train to Thailand as a common smartphone 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:30.140
 General smartphone case does not absorb electromagnetic waves 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 As you see, the funeral case absorbs up to about 90% of the electromagnetic radiation and further enhances the reception sensitivity. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 This technology is a patented technology acquired in Japan 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.370
 Up to about 90% absorption of electromagnetic waves 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 Further enhance the reception sensitivity of mobile phones 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:51.000
 The biggest difference with conventional products is that conventional batteries have irregularly reflected products. 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 Electromagnetic wave absorption case of funeral against though was something to be a lot of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.850
 To absorb the range if the thing 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.660
 The to strengthen the reception sensitivity absorbs the electromagnetic wave generated from the smart phone is the only in the world 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.660
 Only so good 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.160
 Compatible with iphone ipad and galaxy devices
