got a slew of questions about why I was

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
got a slew of questions about why I was
doing<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:14.700> going<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.570> iPad

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
only thing that changed I didn't see a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
only thing that changed I didn't see a
reason<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.840> upgrade<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.290> own<00:01:04.409> personal<00:01:04.769> tablet

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
reason to upgrade my own personal tablet

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
reason to upgrade my own personal tablet
I<00:01:05.339> didn't<00:01:05.790> need<00:01:05.850> touch<00:01:06.060> ID<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.479> tablet<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
don't travel that much anymore so I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.770 
don't travel that much anymore so I
don't<00:01:08.369> worry<00:01:08.549> about<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.820> security<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
don't worry about that security so

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.000
