00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.050
 There are different types of fire trucks 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.090
 the pumpers 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.690
 they connect to hydrants 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.909
 they accumulate pressure 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.449
 iris paranaguÃ¡ through hoses 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.739
 those of stairs go up to the firemen 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.799
 either on a ladder or on a platform 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.739
 and rescuers have tools to cut metal and clear obstacles 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.060
 cheat 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.239
 your 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.349
 the first little firemen could do more than hand buckets 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.310
 in hand 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.850
 in 1720 cars equipped with water tanks began to be used and 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.400
 manual pumps 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.870
 these new pumps would be ineffective according to current standards 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 but they were a huge advance 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 the first trucks pulled by horses and with pumps driven by 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.070
 steam entered service in 1852 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.970
 the trucks with engines of explosion replaced it at the beginning of the century 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.340
 twenty 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.560
 bildu 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.120
 it rains this fire engine pumper can shoot six thousand liters 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.820
 of water per minute 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.490
 mechanical engineers normally design trucks to merida to cover 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 the specific needs of the firefighters who place the order 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.770
 the body is manufactured with marine aluminum plates of four millimeters 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.870
 thick 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.730
 following the technical drawings the operators cut the aluminum panels 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.290
 according to the required sizes and cut certain corners at an angle of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.410
 90 degrees 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.280
 cocktail 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.999
 the operators 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.540
 release the pieces 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.650
 to form the interior 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.590
 in the cabin not only the firefighters travel but the panel also goes 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 of control for the water system 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.700
 the game 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.060
 meanwhile other workers measure or cut pieces of aluminum to manufacture 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.610
 in his thesis that will support the interior from below 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.419
 All parts are welded 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.279
 I 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.110
 4 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.080
 When placing the stairs, the operators leave a rollover of approximately 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.080
 centimeter and a half to drain the water 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.290
 the storage compartments are lined with aluminum plates 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.929
 and using a sandpaper they mark rough circle on the smooth surface 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:46.849
 this drawing camouflage the scratches that will inevitably occur when taking 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.409
 and put the equipment clear 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.319
 to fold the plates according to the required shape a folder is used 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.529
 Then with a punch press the operators make the holes for the 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:07.429
 lights the handles of the doors and the different controls hello 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.419
 now the pieces are assembled 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.650
 and the necessary adjustments are always made before painting so as not to 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.469
 damage the finish 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.349
 After the adjustment all is disassembled and the pieces are sent to the department of 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.189
 painting 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.189
 later they will be reassembled with care 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.909
 you can start the final assembly 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.260
 that starts with the water pump the manufacturer has sent fully assembled 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.439
 the following the interior this is for a yellow rescue vehicle 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:56.039
 the pipes that enter and leave the water pump go through a screw machine 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:02.009
 the tubes are partly galvanized steel and partly stainless steel 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.859
 once threaded are ready to be screwed into the pump outputs 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:19.909
 the drive shaft that long piece that comes out of the transmission not only meets its 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.919
 usual work of turning the rear axle when the engine is in motion 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.150
 also runs the water pump when the truck is stopped 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.229
 This box controls the electric system of the truck including the lights of 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.490
 emergency 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.229
 Each cable is coded by color number and the official 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.979
 the game 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.089
 the operators carry the cables from the box is the control panel that is 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:55.460
 in the cabin 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.669
 efe 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.669
 two 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:06.110
 then connect the speedometer and other instruments on the dashboard 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.940
 install gauges for water pressure adapters to connect the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.169
 hoses to the water system and pressure reducing valves to adjust the 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.330
 pressure or not 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.740
 before we know it, we have a new fire truck 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.139
 and if we get the ladies to leave the firefighters alone 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.479
 they will be able to do their job
