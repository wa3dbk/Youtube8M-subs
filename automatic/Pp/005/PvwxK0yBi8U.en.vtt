00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
I'm hosting it separately because I'm

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.589 
I'm hosting it separately because I'm
really<00:00:11.250> not<00:00:11.400> sure<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.910> much<00:00:12.059> sense<00:00:12.389> it's

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
really not sure how much sense it's

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
really not sure how much sense it's
going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> make<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.340> limited

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
going to make I have just a limited

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.260 
going to make I have just a limited
understanding<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.719> economics<00:00:16.820> which<00:00:17.820> might

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
understanding of economics which might

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.330 
understanding of economics which might
not<00:00:18.720> make<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.990> very<00:00:19.140> easy<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.619> me<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> convey

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
not make it very easy for me to convey

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880 
not make it very easy for me to convey
that<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.570> we'll<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> goes<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that to you so we'll see how it goes and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.790 
that to you so we'll see how it goes and
maybe<00:00:23.609> somebody<00:00:23.910> else<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.990> better<00:00:25.170> job<00:00:25.500> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
maybe somebody else can do better job I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.570 
maybe somebody else can do better job I
don't<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:28.050> general<00:00:28.590> idea<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
don't know but the general idea of it is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.359 
don't know but the general idea of it is
the<00:00:30.210> less<00:00:30.390> money<00:00:30.869> less<00:00:31.230> money<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the less money less money that you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.690 
the less money less money that you
inject<00:00:32.759> into<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.270> economy<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> less<00:00:35.370> money

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
inject into the economy the less money

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.639 
inject into the economy the less money

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
coming for me and then they will go and
spend<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.210> which<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.229> create<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
spend it which will just create this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.820 
spend it which will just create this
whole<00:01:17.040> chain<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> events<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.560> that's<00:01:19.560> my

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
whole chain of events and that's my

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.460 
whole chain of events and that's my
horrible<00:01:20.280> way<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> explaining<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.259> more

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
horrible way of explaining that the more

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
horrible way of explaining that the more
money<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.890> spend<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:23.850> money<00:01:23.880> other

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
money we spend the more money other

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.399 
money we spend the more money other
people<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.840> spend<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.350> just

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
people can spend and really it just

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.160 
people can spend and really it just
reinforces<00:01:29.400> our<00:01:29.700> whole<00:01:29.939> consumerist<00:01:30.600> society

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
reinforces our whole consumerist society

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.399 
reinforces our whole consumerist society
which<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.229> might

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
which is not that good and you might

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.060 
which is not that good and you might
think<00:01:34.909> no<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.270> stop<00:01:36.509> buying<00:01:36.750> things<00:01:37.110> then

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
think no if I stop buying things then

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.440 
think no if I stop buying things then
everybody<00:01:38.460> else<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.790> stop<00:01:38.939> buying<00:01:39.150> things

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
everybody else will stop buying things

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
everybody else will stop buying things
and<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.960> economy<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.650> collapse<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and the economy will just collapse and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.670 
and the economy will just collapse and
we'll<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.970> another<00:01:42.270> depression<00:01:44.360> maybe<00:01:45.680> but

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
we'll have another depression maybe but

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
we'll have another depression maybe but
probably<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:48.119> mean<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.960> many

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
probably not I mean there's so many

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
probably not I mean there's so many
things<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.530> place<00:01:49.680> these<00:01:49.950> days<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.880> terms<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
things in place these days in terms of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.980 
things in place these days in terms of
government<00:01:51.930> policies<00:01:53.030> whatever<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.630> prevent

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
government policies whatever to prevent

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
government policies whatever to prevent
such<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> thing<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> depression<00:01:56.610> there's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
such a thing as a depression there's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.100 
such a thing as a depression there's
unemployment<00:01:58.439> insurance<00:01:58.619> there's<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.899> many

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
unemployment insurance there's so many

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.749 
unemployment insurance there's so many
little<00:02:01.439> checks<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> balances<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.610> would

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
little checks and balances that would

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.260 
little checks and balances that would
prevent<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.500> depression<00:02:04.500> from<00:02:04.649> happening

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
prevent a depression from happening

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.849 
prevent a depression from happening
I'm<00:02:05.390> not<00:02:05.539> saying<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:05.960> impossible<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:06.740> I'm

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
I'm not saying it's impossible but I'm

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.389 
I'm not saying it's impossible but I'm
saying<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.280> highly<00:02:07.490> unlikely<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:09.399> really

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
saying it's highly unlikely and really

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.030 
saying it's highly unlikely and really
it's<00:02:10.759> not<00:02:11.090> gonna<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.629> lot<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.840> harm<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.890> you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
it's not gonna do a lot of harm if you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's not gonna do a lot of harm if you

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
because I see that as a necessity but

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.300 
because I see that as a necessity but
maybe<00:02:22.129> you<00:02:22.370> don't<00:02:22.610> need<00:02:23.000> three<00:02:23.660> TVs<00:02:24.080> maybe<00:02:24.950> two

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
would suffice or maybe your yo-yo

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.910 
would suffice or maybe your yo-yo
