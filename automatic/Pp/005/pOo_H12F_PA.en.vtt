than fear Oh which I'm pretty sure it is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.860 
than fear Oh which I'm pretty sure it is
just<00:02:28.270> because<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:28.750> tool<00:02:28.960> stat<00:02:29.620> base<00:02:29.860> Oh

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870

Bureau<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.080> better<00:02:32.350> than<00:02:32.530> Pidgeotto<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:34.120> it's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
Bureau is better than Pidgeotto but it's

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.480

not better than Pidgeot at least in my
expects<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.010> my<00:02:39.010> thought<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:40.960> it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
expects but my thought just because it

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.340 
expects but my thought just because it
has<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> better<00:02:41.740> overall<00:02:42.160> stat<00:02:42.640> base<00:02:42.880> then

attacks<00:03:34.060> anyway<00:03:34.709> um<00:03:35.709> but<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.910> mean<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.180> guess

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
attacks anyway um but I mean I guess

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.540 
attacks anyway um but I mean I guess
it's<00:03:37.660> helpful<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.410> not<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.770> tough-love<00:03:39.220> sniper

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
it's helpful but not a tough-love sniper

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.500 
it's helpful but not a tough-love sniper
would<00:03:39.730> be<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.350> um<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:42.010> can<00:03:42.220> learn<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:43.060> movies

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
would be and um it can learn more movies

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.720 
would be and um it can learn more movies
Sparrow<00:03:44.350> while<00:03:44.560> level<00:03:44.950> up<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.430> come<00:03:45.640> on

can learners drill peck which can do
eighty<00:03:52.480> base<00:03:52.720> power<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.170> think<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.680> um<00:03:54.640> Pidgey

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
eighty base power I think and um Pidgey

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.080 
eighty base power I think and um Pidgey
can<00:03:56.100> learn<00:03:57.100> hurricane<00:03:57.640> which<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
can learn hurricane which is like a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.660 
can learn hurricane which is like a
hundred<00:03:58.330> base<00:03:59.110> far<00:03:59.320> so<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.620> has<00:03:59.830> a<00:03:59.860> better<00:04:00.130> last

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
hundred base far so it has a better last

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.560 
hundred base far so it has a better last
attack<00:04:01.090> they<00:04:01.300> can<00:04:01.330> learn<00:04:01.600> but<00:04:02.590> um<00:04:03.390> you'll<00:04:04.390> see

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
attack they can learn but um you'll see

wins<00:04:30.879> in<00:04:31.830> its<00:04:32.830> defense<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:34.060> it's<00:04:34.689> special<00:04:35.110> and

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
wins in its defense and it's special and

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.850 
wins in its defense and it's special and
special<00:04:36.159> and<00:04:37.319> special<00:04:38.319> to<00:04:38.409> attack<00:04:38.710> him

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
special and special to attack him

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.580 
special and special to attack him
special<00:04:39.189> defense<00:04:39.490> but<00:04:40.199> they<00:04:41.199> both<00:04:41.319> have<00:04:41.500> the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
special defense but they both have the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.740 
special defense but they both have the
same<00:04:41.620> HP<00:04:42.280> switch<00:04:42.490> sphere<00:04:42.849> wind<00:04:43.150> speed<00:04:43.599> in

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
same HP switch sphere wind speed in

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.240 
same HP switch sphere wind speed in
attack<00:04:44.969> now<00:04:45.969> say<00:04:46.479> what<00:04:46.659> you<00:04:46.840> might<00:04:47.110> but<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.889> get

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
attack now say what you might but I get

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.159 
attack now say what you might but I get
I<00:04:48.490> think<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.389> Pidgey<00:04:49.750> with<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.990> better

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
I think of it to Pidgey with the better

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.379 
I think of it to Pidgey with the better
special<00:04:50.650> defense<00:04:50.979> but<00:04:51.310> it's<00:04:51.430> only<00:04:51.610> by<00:04:51.849> for

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
special defense but it's only by for

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.770 
special defense but it's only by for
like<00:04:52.990> counts<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.550> doesn't<00:04:54.879> really<00:04:55.060> matter

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
like counts so I doesn't really matter

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.490 
like counts so I doesn't really matter
really

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
really

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.399 
really
um<00:04:58.860> but<00:04:59.860> yeah<00:05:00.659> this<00:05:01.659> isn't<00:05:01.900> going<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.199> be<00:05:02.289> as

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
um but yeah this isn't going to be as

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.170 
um but yeah this isn't going to be as
long<00:05:02.680> as<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:02.919> would<00:05:03.129> like<00:05:03.279> it<00:05:03.490> just<00:05:03.669> because<00:05:03.819> of

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
long as I would like it just because of

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.559 
long as I would like it just because of
how<00:05:04.379> simple<00:05:05.379> the<00:05:05.650> pokemons<00:05:06.009> were<00:05:06.340> or<00:05:06.699> are<00:05:07.240> at

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
how simple the pokemons were or are at

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.029 
how simple the pokemons were or are at
least<00:05:07.779> cuz<00:05:08.080> they're<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.590> same<00:05:08.740> type<00:05:09.009> of

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
least cuz they're the same type of

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.920 
least cuz they're the same type of
Pokemon<00:05:09.580> there<00:05:09.759> so<00:05:10.000> they<00:05:10.509> have<00:05:10.659> the<00:05:10.779> same

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
Pokemon there so they have the same

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.559 
Pokemon there so they have the same
weaknesses<00:05:11.199> they<00:05:11.830> have<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.069> same<00:05:12.569> resistance

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
weaknesses they have the same resistance

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.219 
weaknesses they have the same resistance
to<00:05:13.930> stuff<00:05:14.229> like<00:05:14.349> that<00:05:14.639> so<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.960> wouldn't

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
to stuff like that so this wouldn't

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.990 
to stuff like that so this wouldn't
isn't<00:05:17.529> gonna<00:05:17.620> be<00:05:17.740> as<00:05:17.830> long<00:05:18.039> as<00:05:18.189> like<00:05:18.340> you<00:05:18.669> put

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
isn't gonna be as long as like you put

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.929 
isn't gonna be as long as like you put
two<00:05:19.210> legendaries<00:05:19.930> like<00:05:20.580> together<00:05:21.580> something

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:21.939 
two legendaries like together something

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.260 
two legendaries like together something
like<00:05:22.060> that<00:05:22.240> but<00:05:22.990> um<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:24.669> isn't<00:05:25.029> just<00:05:25.210> gonna

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
like that but um this isn't just gonna

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.929 
like that but um this isn't just gonna

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
and let you guys pick what you guys

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.149 
and let you guys pick what you guys
would<00:05:30.849> think<00:05:31.180> is<00:05:31.930> better<00:05:32.110> Spiro<00:05:32.589> or<00:05:32.770> Pidgey

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
would think is better Spiro or Pidgey

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.329 
would think is better Spiro or Pidgey
and<00:05:33.370> try<00:05:34.120> not<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.330> go<00:05:34.539> by<00:05:34.719> fear<00:05:35.259> o<00:05:35.289> or<00:05:35.650> Pidgeotto

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:36.339 
and try not to go by fear o or Pidgeotto

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.850 
and try not to go by fear o or Pidgeotto
Pidgeot<00:05:36.849> because<00:05:37.270> we're<00:05:38.139> not<00:05:38.319> really<00:05:38.560> going

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
Pidgeot because we're not really going

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.920 
Pidgeot because we're not really going
by<00:05:39.069> that<00:05:39.099> but<00:05:39.490> if<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.729> works<00:05:40.000> we<00:05:40.270> were<00:05:40.449> going<00:05:40.690> to

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
by that but if it works we were going to

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.379 
by that but if it works we were going to
go<00:05:41.080> by<00:05:41.289> final<00:05:41.650> evolved<00:05:42.099> evolution<00:05:42.819> I'd<00:05:43.029> have

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
go by final evolved evolution I'd have

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.209 
go by final evolved evolution I'd have
to<00:05:43.539> go<00:05:43.659> with<00:05:43.690> Pidgey<00:05:44.349> because<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.800> pitch<00:05:44.979> shot

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
to go with Pidgey because of pitch shot

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.909 
to go with Pidgey because of pitch shot
but<00:05:45.969> if<00:05:46.449> you're<00:05:46.690> going<00:05:46.870> by<00:05:47.080> second<00:05:47.440> evolution

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
but if you're going by second evolution

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.769 
but if you're going by second evolution
since<00:05:48.099> sparrow<00:05:48.490> only<00:05:48.759> has<00:05:48.909> two<00:05:49.210> evolutions

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
since sparrow only has two evolutions

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:55.369 
since sparrow only has two evolutions
Bureau<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.979> way<00:05:51.849> better<00:05:52.029> than<00:05:52.300> Pidgeotto<00:05:52.900> um

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
Bureau is way better than Pidgeotto um
