popping along the edge and feeling the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.480 
popping along the edge and feeling the
weeds<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.350> every<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.220> then<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.460> just

exactly what this guy did when I popped
it<00:02:01.009> off<00:02:01.100> he<00:02:01.430> picked<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.759> up<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.090> just<00:02:02.479> felt<00:02:02.570> a

it off he picked it up I just felt a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.450 
it off he picked it up I just felt a
machinist<00:02:03.320> set<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.710> hook<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
machinist set the hook in and a

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.520 
machinist set the hook in and a
beautiful<00:02:05.360> chlorophyll<00:02:06.049> akes<00:02:06.229> walleye<00:02:07.209> nice

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
beautiful chlorophyll akes walleye nice

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.580 
beautiful chlorophyll akes walleye nice
alright<00:02:09.530> back<00:02:09.769> he<00:02:09.919> goes<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:11.239> it's<00:02:11.989> not<00:02:12.200> really

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
alright back he goes so it's not really

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.009 
alright back he goes so it's not really
a<00:02:12.620> weedless<00:02:13.010> technique<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.389> if<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.599> fish<00:02:14.840> it

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
a weedless technique but if you fish it

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:15.730 
a weedless technique but if you fish it
right

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
right

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.650 
right
keep<00:02:15.890> your<00:02:16.010> rod<00:02:16.190> tip<00:02:16.220> up<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.300> can<00:02:17.450> kind<00:02:17.600> of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
keep your rod tip up you can kind of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300 
keep your rod tip up you can kind of
bounce<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.200> through<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> weeds<00:02:18.680> as<00:02:18.980> long<00:02:19.190> as

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
bounce it through the weeds as long as

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.430 
bounce it through the weeds as long as
you're<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.460> in<00:02:19.640> super<00:02:19.940> thick<00:02:20.150> ones<00:02:20.390> there's<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
you're not in super thick ones there's a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.660 
you're not in super thick ones there's a
couple<00:02:21.650> things<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.160> do<00:02:22.250> when<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.430> get<00:02:22.550> in

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
couple things you can do when you get in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.950 
couple things you can do when you get in
thicker<00:02:22.850> weeds<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.180> can<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.420> ones<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.810> have

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
thicker weeds you can get ones that have

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.360 
thicker weeds you can get ones that have
a<00:02:23.990> little<00:02:24.200> bit<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.410> brush<00:02:24.620> guard<00:02:24.860> on<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.250> that

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
a little bit of a brush guard on it that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.310 
a little bit of a brush guard on it that
shake<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> weeds<00:02:25.910> off<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:27.140> these

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
shake the weeds off but I like these

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.630 
shake the weeds off but I like these
ones<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.800> get<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> better<00:02:28.220> hooking

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
ones because you get a better hooking

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.910 
ones because you get a better hooking

confidence with it you can work through

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.040 
confidence with it you can work through
those<00:02:34.520> weeds<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:34.880> fine<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.570> catch<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.780> lot<00:02:35.960> of

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
those weeds just fine and catch a lot of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110 
those weeds just fine and catch a lot of
good<00:02:36.170> wallet<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.680> like<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.010> one<00:02:37.820> thing<00:02:38.000> you

want to do when you're fishing with any
kind<00:02:39.770> of<00:02:39.860> jig<00:02:40.070> for<00:02:40.310> walleye<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:41.120> always<00:02:41.510> used

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
kind of jig for walleye it's always used

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.170 
kind of jig for walleye it's always used
sensitive<00:02:42.290> rods<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.310> an<00:02:43.400> ima<00:02:43.700> graphite

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
sensitive rods this is an ima graphite

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.960 
sensitive rods this is an ima graphite
rod<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.690> got<00:02:45.020> fluorocarbon<00:02:45.800> line<00:02:46.010> on<00:02:46.310> now

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
rod I got fluorocarbon line on now

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.190 
rod I got fluorocarbon line on now
fluorocarbon<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.810> not<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.050> most

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
fluorocarbon is not the most

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.980 
fluorocarbon is not the most
user-friendly<00:02:48.500> kind<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.130> line<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.090> it

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
user-friendly kind of line but it it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.210 
user-friendly kind of line but it it
gives<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.290> little<00:02:51.380> bit<00:02:51.500> more<00:02:51.590> sensitivity

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
gives you a little bit more sensitivity

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.530 
gives you a little bit more sensitivity
so<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.610> can<00:02:52.730> feel<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.030> bites<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.300> little<00:02:53.450> bit

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
so you can feel it bites a little bit

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.810 
so you can feel it bites a little bit
better<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> it's<00:02:54.830> completely<00:02:55.190> invisible<00:02:55.400> so

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
better and it's completely invisible so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.280 
better and it's completely invisible so
the<00:02:55.910> walleye<00:02:56.120> aren't<00:02:56.750> going<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.990> spook

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
the walleye aren't going to spook

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.220 
the walleye aren't going to spook
because<00:02:57.650> they<00:02:57.770> see<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.100> line<00:02:59.110> the<00:03:00.110> other

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
because they see the line the other

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.270 
because they see the line the other
thing<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.470> want<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.650> do<00:03:00.770> is<00:03:00.860> keep<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.040> smooth

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
thing you want to do is keep a smooth

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.670 
thing you want to do is keep a smooth
drag<00:03:01.550> system<00:03:01.970> big<00:03:02.780> walleye<00:03:02.990> loads<00:03:03.290> on<00:03:03.500> you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
drag system big walleye loads on you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.570 
drag system big walleye loads on you
need<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.860> let<00:03:04.010> them<00:03:04.100> run<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.460> because

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
need to let them run with it because
