00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 we take these tubes 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.100
 aluminum to make a divider screen 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.910
 of environments in this case to cover the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 seen when entering the apartment 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.290
 this screen will be armed with eight tubes 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.959
 of two meters cut into four pieces 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.490
 one meter eighty- four of a meter 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.340
 twenty four more than twenty 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.730
 centimeters in addition as connectors let's 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.580
 to use four open handrails 4t with 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.529
 bolts 40 universal fixings and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.710
 polypropylene rope to make the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.480
 framework before assembling the pieces in 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.699
 pieces of a meter 80 and a meter 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 20 you have to draw the lines every 20 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.460
 centimeters in the longest are 8 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.590
 lines and in the others only 5 on each side 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.239
 of these marks we will measure 28 millimeters 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.600
 which is the space that will occupy 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.600
 connectors 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.649
 now let's move on and fix the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.269
 connectors in each of the brands 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.860
 we have to do this in an order 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.100
 established so that afterwards we do not have 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.530
 Assembly problems 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 in the four pieces of one meter eighty 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.710
 for a universal fixation and one of 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.400
 four universal applications another py 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 one more fixation 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.340
 all the connectors are drilled and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.340
 we finished to do the fixation 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.730
 in two pieces of 1 meter 20 will pass 5 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.100
 universal fixings and in two others 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.890
 cuts of a meter 20 goes a handrail 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.660
 open three universal fixings and 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.660
 another handrail open out 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.860
 then with the conchos chunks we have 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 than to assemble two frames that finally 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 join with elbows at their ends 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.939
 We can achieve the shape of the screen 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.189
 placing these 20 centimeters tubes 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.070
 in the tf with bolts here the way 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.790
 fix is ​​only to place the tube and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.790
 tighten the bolts 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.910
 We are going to make the frame of the screen 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.500
 with ropes with them we are going to make a 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.720
 traced to be able to break the views 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.520
 so that the screen is hooked 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.690
 we have to pass the rope for all 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 the universal fixings 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.240
 here on the screen for example we could 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.400
 put some vine or photos for 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.810
 make it a little busier I hope that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.490
 these three solutions that we saw them 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.319
 have liked that they are special for 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.880
 youthful places and also for 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.440
 optimize the space and remember that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.780
 you can see this project again 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.650
 as many times as you want in www point to the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.650
 from the same point cl
