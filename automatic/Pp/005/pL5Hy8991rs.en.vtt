was<00:01:30.010> designed<00:01:30.369> for<00:01:30.520> Windows<00:01:30.820> 3.1<00:01:31.360> in<00:01:31.869> Das<00:01:32.049> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
was designed for Windows 3.1 in Das and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390 
was designed for Windows 3.1 in Das and
we<00:01:33.490> read<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.299> could<00:01:34.689> be<00:01:35.189> used<00:01:36.189> with

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
we read that it could be used with

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.770 
we read that it could be used with
Windows<00:01:36.670> 95<00:01:36.939> so<00:01:37.510> we<00:01:38.140> install<00:01:38.439> them<00:01:38.590> as<00:01:38.680> 95

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
Windows 95 so we install them as 95

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.000 
Windows 95 so we install them as 95
which<00:01:40.780> was<00:01:40.990> kind<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.320> pain<00:01:41.500> because<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.920> was

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
which was kind of a pain because it was

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.990 
which was kind of a pain because it was
all<00:01:42.159> on<00:01:42.570> diskettes<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:44.729> eventually<00:01:45.729> we<00:01:45.820> did

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
all on diskettes and eventually we did

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.060 
all on diskettes and eventually we did
get<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.270> working<00:01:46.420> but<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.500> biggest<00:01:47.680> problems

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
get it working but the biggest problems

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.030 
get it working but the biggest problems
finding<00:01:48.280> pen<00:01:48.460> drivers<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:50.470> dad<00:01:50.619> managed<00:01:50.950> to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.670 
finding pen drivers my dad managed to
find<00:01:51.250> them<00:01:51.340> online<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:53.200> played<00:01:53.439> with<00:01:53.590> this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680

for<00:01:53.740> probably<00:01:54.250> two<00:01:54.549> two<00:01:55.119> months<00:01:56.070> but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
for probably two two months but

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.499 
for probably two two months but
eventually<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.549> did<00:01:57.670> get<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.939> working<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.390> took

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
eventually we did get it working it took

there's<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.420> thoug<00:02:07.900> spin<00:02:08.319> interface<00:02:08.910> but

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
there's a thoug spin interface but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.860 
there's a thoug spin interface but
it<00:02:11.830> does<00:02:12.040> work<00:02:12.280> which<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.300> surprising

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
it does work which is the surprising

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.809 
it does work which is the surprising
thing<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:16.959> Windows<00:02:17.290> 95<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.640> pen

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
thing so we have Windows 95 the pen

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.119 
thing so we have Windows 95 the pen
works<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.540> best<00:02:22.780> example<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:23.950> guess

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
works now the best example here I guess

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.800 
works now the best example here I guess
is<00:02:24.159> paint<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.980> not<00:02:30.129> exactly<00:02:30.430> fast<00:02:30.760> but<00:02:31.209> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
is paint it's not exactly fast but you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.809 
is paint it's not exactly fast but you
know<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:31.959> works<00:02:34.950> what<00:02:35.950> else<00:02:36.129> can<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> show<00:02:36.459> off

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
know it works what else can I show off

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.610 
know it works what else can I show off
you<00:02:37.060> there's<00:02:37.660> some<00:02:37.810> funny<00:02:38.170> little<00:02:38.260> things<00:02:38.530> on

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
you there's some funny little things on

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.860 
you there's some funny little things on
the<00:02:38.709> side<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.099> there's<00:02:39.310> volume<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.629> guess

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the side here there's volume for I guess

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.910 
the side here there's volume for I guess
whatever<00:02:41.620> internal<00:02:41.980> speaker<00:02:43.920> contrast

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
whatever internal speaker contrast

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.140 
whatever internal speaker contrast
adjustment<00:02:45.400> cuz<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.700> black<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.060> white

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
adjustment cuz the black and white

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.349 
adjustment cuz the black and white
screen<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:48.129> could<00:02:48.280> turn<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.940> backlight<00:02:49.090> on

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
screen you could turn the backlight on

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.539 
screen you could turn the backlight on
and<00:02:49.540> off<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.709> there's<00:02:50.859> also<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.280> which

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
and off and there's also this which

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.300 
and off and there's also this which
flips<00:02:51.849> or<00:02:52.269> inverts<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.879> LCD<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.660> it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
flips or inverts the the LCD so it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.970 
flips or inverts the the LCD so it
becomes<00:02:57.310> black<00:02:58.379> there's<00:02:59.379> also<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.950> just

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
becomes black there's also this is just

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.240 
becomes black there's also this is just
a<00:03:00.310> sleep<00:03:00.579> button<00:03:04.560> hard<00:03:05.560> drive<00:03:05.769> goes<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
a sleep button hard drive goes in this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.860 
a sleep button hard drive goes in this
little<00:03:06.489> door<00:03:06.640> here<00:03:06.670> which<00:03:07.090> we<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:07.299> taped

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
little door here which we have taped

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.289 
little door here which we have taped
down<00:03:08.459> or<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.549> can<00:03:09.700> put<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:09.970> couple<00:03:10.120> other

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
down or you can put in a couple other

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.349 
down or you can put in a couple other
things<00:03:10.390> such<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:10.720> like<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> modem<00:03:12.150> then<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.209> got

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
things such as like a modem then you got

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.940 
things such as like a modem then you got
two<00:03:13.510> batteries<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.079> back<00:03:14.319> like<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.709> said

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
two batteries on the back like I said

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.509 
two batteries on the back like I said
earlier<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:16.650> really<00:03:17.650> don't<00:03:17.919> have<00:03:17.980> many<00:03:18.130> uses

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
earlier I really don't have many uses

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.890 
earlier I really don't have many uses
for<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.790> other<00:03:19.000> than<00:03:19.090> just<00:03:19.269> going<00:03:19.389> on<00:03:19.540> display

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
for it other than just going on display

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.140 
for it other than just going on display
it<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.889> fact<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.340> works<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.700> really<00:03:21.819> cool

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it the fact that it works is really cool

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.759 
it the fact that it works is really cool
but<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.980> pretty<00:03:24.130> much<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:25.530> trying<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.620> think

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
but it's pretty much it trying to think

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.809 
but it's pretty much it trying to think
if<00:03:26.829> there's<00:03:26.980> anything<00:03:27.040> else<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.489> could<00:03:27.549> show

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
if there's anything else I could show

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.420 
if there's anything else I could show
off<00:03:27.849> on<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.910> model<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.660> 7:30<00:03:32.410> T<00:03:32.739> IBM

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
off on here the model is the 7:30 T IBM

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.059 
off on here the model is the 7:30 T IBM
ThinkPad<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:36.780> believe<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.049> designed<00:03:38.560> for

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
ThinkPad I believe it was designed for

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.930 
ThinkPad I believe it was designed for
like<00:03:40.230> inventory<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.440> warehouses<00:03:42.099> and<00:03:42.400> jobs

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
like inventory and warehouses and jobs

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.339 
like inventory and warehouses and jobs
like<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:43.480> really<00:03:43.630> wasn't<00:03:43.840> meant<00:03:44.109> as<00:03:44.290> a

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
like that it really wasn't meant as a

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.000 
like that it really wasn't meant as a
home<00:03:44.590> use<00:03:44.799> kind<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.190> tablet<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:48.430> cost<00:03:48.609> me<00:03:48.760> $2<00:03:49.269> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
home use kind of tablet it cost me $2 I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.199 
home use kind of tablet it cost me $2 I
actually<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.280> two<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.459> them<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.000> other<00:03:52.120> one

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
actually have two of them the other one

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.849 
actually have two of them the other one
I<00:03:52.329> didn't<00:03:52.569> restore<00:03:52.900> we<00:03:53.260> worked<00:03:53.440> on<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:53.680> one

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
I didn't restore we worked on this one

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:54.960 
I didn't restore we worked on this one
because<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.099> was<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.340> nicer<00:03:54.639> of<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.819> two

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
because it was the nicer of the two

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.019 
because it was the nicer of the two
surprising<00:03:55.629> enough<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.810> works
