on<00:00:09.990> wound<00:00:10.849> allocation<00:00:12.200> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.650> something

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
on wound allocation this is something

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.810 
on wound allocation this is something
new<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.490> necrons<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.490> reason<00:00:17.609> i'm<00:00:17.789> doing

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
new for necrons and the reason i'm doing

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
new for necrons and the reason i'm doing
this<00:00:18.000> video<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> basically<00:00:18.650> they<00:00:19.650> could<00:00:19.859> be

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
this video is basically they could be

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
this video is basically they could be
near<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> neck<00:00:20.400> crunch<00:00:20.670> could<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.029> new<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> 40k

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
near to neck crunch could be new to 40k

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
near to neck crunch could be new to 40k
you<00:00:21.869> may<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.380> understand<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.699> may<00:00:23.850> not

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
you may not understand and we may not

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.810 
you may not understand and we may not
know<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.390> wound<00:00:25.260> allocation<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.160> how<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
know about wound allocation and how to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.660 
know about wound allocation and how to
get<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> best<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.289> unit<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
get the best out of the unit there's a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.490 
get the best out of the unit there's a
couple<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.000> units<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> Codex<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
couple of units in the Codex that you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
couple of units in the Codex that you
can<00:00:31.650> take<00:00:31.769> advantage<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.820> first<00:00:33.090> one

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
can take advantage of this the first one

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.799 
can take advantage of this the first one
is<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.899> tomb<00:00:34.140> spiders<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:36.030> now<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
is the tomb spiders so now we have a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.520 
is the tomb spiders so now we have a
unit<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.410> team<00:00:37.649> spiders<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.910> three<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.530> think

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
unit of team spiders up to three I think

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.200 
unit of team spiders up to three I think
most<00:00:40.710> people<00:00:40.980> will<00:00:41.340> probably<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.790> take<00:00:41.969> two

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
most people will probably just take two

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
most people will probably just take two
at<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> time<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.320> may<00:00:43.440> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.770> take<00:00:43.920> three

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
at a time but you may want to take three

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.049 
at a time but you may want to take three
now<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.539> dedication<00:00:45.960> basically<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.059> making

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
now in dedication basically is making

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.160 
now in dedication basically is making
each<00:00:48.300> model<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.730> different<00:00:50.930> war<00:00:51.930> gear

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
each model have different war gear

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
each model have different war gear
different<00:00:52.530> options<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> gun<00:00:54.809> for

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
different options so one with a gun for

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
different options so one with a gun for
example<00:00:55.610> one<00:00:56.610> without<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.910> gun<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> had<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
example one without a gun have you had a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
example one without a gun have you had a
third<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.430> make<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
third one you can actually make that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.439 
third one you can actually make that
different<00:01:00.390> take<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.280> psychic<00:01:02.280> anti<00:01:03.090> psychic

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
different take the psychic anti psychic

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.870 
different take the psychic anti psychic
power<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.320> example<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:05.339> soon<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
power for example as soon as you have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
power for example as soon as you have
models<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.360> different<00:01:06.810> wounds<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
models with different wounds you can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.550 
models with different wounds you can
actually<00:01:07.619> allocate<00:01:08.490> winds<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.180> come<00:01:09.360> in

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
actually allocate winds as they come in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.510 
actually allocate winds as they come in
so<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.710> example<00:01:10.740> say<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> had<00:01:12.890> some<00:01:13.890> wounds<00:01:14.280> say

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so for example say I had some wounds say

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
so for example say I had some wounds say
I<00:01:14.549> had<00:01:14.790> six<00:01:15.030> wings<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.990> opposed<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> just

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I had six wings as opposed to just

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.179 
I had six wings as opposed to just
rolling<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.409> there<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.650> example<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
rolling them all and there for example I

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.170 
rolling them all and there for example I
got<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:22.229> got<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.189> A<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
got one I got one one and A two and that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
got one I got one one and A two and that
would<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.689> they<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.810> exactly<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> same

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
would be if they were exactly the same

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.240 
would be if they were exactly the same
models<00:01:26.040> I'd<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> lose<00:01:26.759> 13<00:01:27.390> spider<00:01:28.250> now

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
models I'd have to lose 13 spider now

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.850 
models I'd have to lose 13 spider now
with<00:01:29.400> wound<00:01:29.610> allocation<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
with wound allocation what you do is you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
with wound allocation what you do is you
put<00:01:32.070> three<00:01:32.490> wounds<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.810> three<00:01:34.110> rooms

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
put three wounds on one and three rooms

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.600 
put three wounds on one and three rooms
on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> other<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.310> roll<00:01:35.460> them

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
on the other and you roll them

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.600 
on the other and you roll them
separately<00:01:36.470> in<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> case<00:01:37.829> he<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.310> fine

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
separately in this case he would be fine

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.010 
separately in this case he would be fine
and<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> case<00:01:40.560> he<00:01:40.890> takes<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.340> wound<00:01:42.020> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and in this case he takes a wound so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
and in this case he takes a wound so
effectively<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.040> could<00:01:44.220> still<00:01:44.399> take<00:01:44.820> three

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
effectively you could still take three

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
effectively you could still take three
rooms<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.810> mean<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> could<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.130> could

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
rooms I mean you could get so he could

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
rooms I mean you could get so he could
have<00:01:47.399> two<00:01:47.610> wings<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.270> he<00:01:48.810> could<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.049> one

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
have two wings and he could have one

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
have two wings and he could have one
wound<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.070> particular<00:01:50.340> role<00:01:50.700> they're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
wound on that particular role they're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
wound on that particular role they're
both<00:01:51.360> still<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.899> which<00:01:52.200> means<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> both

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
both still up which means they can both

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.899 
both still up which means they can both
continue<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.970> spawn<00:01:54.689> scarabs<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
continue to spawn scarabs and be a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.690 
continue to spawn scarabs and be a
threat<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.450> opponent<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.579> have

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
threat to your opponent now we have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.630 
threat to your opponent now we have
another<00:01:59.790> unit<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.250> well

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
another unit which is going to be well

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.389 
another unit which is going to be well
worth<00:02:02.909> trying<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:04.020> green<00:02:04.649> dedications

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
worth trying to go for green dedications

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.480 
worth trying to go for green dedications
and<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.710> race

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
and that is the race

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.470 
and that is the race
turn<00:02:09.480> to<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.660> our<00:02:09.780> best<00:02:10.020> close<00:02:10.260> combat<00:02:10.530> units

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
turn to the our best close combat units

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.220 
turn to the our best close combat units
that<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:13.310> rending<00:02:14.310> etc<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.090> there<00:02:15.360> but

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
that we have rending etc on there but

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.380 
that we have rending etc on there but
there's<00:02:16.740> quite<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> few<00:02:17.130> little<00:02:17.400> options<00:02:18.000> three

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
there's quite a few little options three

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.120 
there's quite a few little options three
options<00:02:18.810> which<00:02:19.110> means<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.860> make

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
options which means that you can make

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.610 
options which means that you can make
the<00:02:20.340> model<00:02:20.670> slightly<00:02:21.090> different<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:22.440> for

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the model slightly different so for

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
the model slightly different so for
example<00:02:22.650> here<00:02:23.070> I've<00:02:23.460> got<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
example here I've got to with the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.940 
example here I've got to with the
particle<00:02:25.080> weapon<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> gun<00:02:26.660> maybe<00:02:27.950> two

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
particle weapon the gun maybe two

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.210 
particle weapon the gun maybe two
without<00:02:29.840> made<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.650> other<00:02:31.680> big<00:02:31.980> gun

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
without made one with the other big gun

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.270 
without made one with the other big gun
also<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:32.880> last<00:02:33.090> widths<00:02:33.510> coil<00:02:34.230> whip<00:02:34.860> coils

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
also you got last widths coil whip coils

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.980 
also you got last widths coil whip coils
in<00:02:35.430> those<00:02:35.580> wells<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.330> mess<00:02:36.480> around<00:02:36.510> with

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
in those wells you can mess around with

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.170 
in those wells you can mess around with
so<00:02:37.740> effective<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.340> when<00:02:38.490> they<00:02:38.580> come<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.910> you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
so effective now when they come in you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.750 
so effective now when they come in you
roll<00:02:39.450> these<00:02:39.630> insects<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.100> your<00:02:41.280> dice<00:02:41.430> come

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
roll these insects so as your dice come

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.220 
roll these insects so as your dice come
in<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.150> had<00:02:42.480> these<00:02:43.340> dice<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.020> I'm<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.170> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
in so I had these dice and I'm going to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.510 
in so I had these dice and I'm going to
have<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.410> allocate<00:02:46.800> these<00:02:46.920> rounds<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.370> say

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
have to allocate these rounds if you say

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.190 
have to allocate these rounds if you say
one<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.820> there<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:51.930> I've<00:02:52.020> got

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
one on there like so and then I've got

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.160 
one on there like so and then I've got
two<00:02:52.410> left<00:02:52.650> over<00:02:52.830> which<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.730> put<00:02:54.000> say<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
two left over which I put say on the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
two left over which I put say on the
weakest<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.130> let's<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.640> say<00:02:56.760> two

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
weakest one so let's just say two

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.420 
weakest one so let's just say two
without<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.420> guns<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.830> then<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> run<00:02:59.250> them

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
without the guns and then you run them

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.290 
without the guns and then you run them
in<00:02:59.760> set<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:00.810> would<00:03:01.050> be<00:03:01.080> for<00:03:01.350> these<00:03:01.500> two<00:03:02.300> so

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
in set so this would be for these two so

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.700 
in set so this would be for these two so
b1<00:03:03.540> wind<00:03:04.020> there<00:03:04.940> he's<00:03:05.940> fine<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.690> then<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.530> is

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
b1 wind there he's fine and then this is

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.050 
b1 wind there he's fine and then this is
rolled<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> set<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:09.590> they're<00:03:10.590> both<00:03:10.770> fine<00:03:11.070> so

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
rolled as a set and they're both fine so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
rolled as a set and they're both fine so
if<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.450> what<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.690> does<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:14.100> pretty

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
if actually what it does and it's pretty

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.100 
if actually what it does and it's pretty
much<00:03:14.490> used<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.240> basically<00:03:15.660> use<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:15.990> you've

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
much used is basically use when you've

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.860 
much used is basically use when you've
got<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.440> than<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.770> wind<00:03:17.870> because

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
got more than one wind because

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.900 
got more than one wind because
effectively<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.070> keep<00:03:20.370> modeled<00:03:20.730> up

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
effectively you can keep modeled up

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.760 
effectively you can keep modeled up
longer<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.690> could<00:03:21.840> affect<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.380> end<00:03:22.560> up

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
longer so you could affect you end up

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.620 
longer so you could affect you end up
with<00:03:22.950> humming<00:03:23.280> sound<00:03:23.610> wind<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:24.030> their<00:03:24.210> wind<00:03:24.450> on

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
with humming sound wind on their wind on

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.680 
with humming sound wind on their wind on
there<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.470> wind<00:03:25.950> down<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.430> there<00:03:26.700> when<00:03:27.600> it's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
there and wind down on there when it's

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.270 
there and wind down on there when it's
effectively<00:03:28.020> what<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.350> would<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.920> normal

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
effectively what that would be in normal

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.070 
effectively what that would be in normal
circumstances<00:03:29.430> would<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.240> a<00:03:30.270> whole<00:03:30.570> model<00:03:30.960> off

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
circumstances would be a whole model off

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.860 
circumstances would be a whole model off
and<00:03:31.980> then<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> wound<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.180> next<00:03:33.420> model<00:03:33.720> if

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and then a wound on the next model if

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.050 
and then a wound on the next model if
they<00:03:34.080> were<00:03:34.140> all<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.410> same<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.850> rune

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
they were all the same so rune

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.350 
they were all the same so rune
dedication<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:36.990> multi<00:03:37.560> wounded<00:03:38.360> creatures

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
dedication on multi wounded creatures

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.680 
dedication on multi wounded creatures
basically<00:03:40.970> hopefully<00:03:41.970> that's<00:03:42.120> useful<00:03:42.330> for

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
basically hopefully that's useful for

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.260 
basically hopefully that's useful for
you<00:03:42.960> will<00:03:43.920> help<00:03:44.190> keep<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.610> unis<00:03:44.940> alive

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
you will help keep the unis alive

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.600 
you will help keep the unis alive
slightly<00:03:45.810> longer<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:46.800> be<00:03:47.070> more<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.430> threat

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
slightly longer and be more of a threat

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.790 
slightly longer and be more of a threat
