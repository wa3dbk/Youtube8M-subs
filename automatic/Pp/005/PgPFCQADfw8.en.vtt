00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:09.969
 needs to 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.629
 yes and especially if the note 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.489
 goals with set pieces 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.119
 and that is the worrying thing 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 Of course he did quite well 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 we responded 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.909
 and at the end of accounts 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.289
 tied with his commitment 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 what I rescue is that yes we continue with the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.670
 mentality first of all 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 boyle puskar the defensive control that gave appointment the portal 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.790
 look for a little more offensive variants 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.940
 what we needed last year 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 although remote according to valverde offensive 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.410
 victim reached the arch 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.230
 but we do not specify 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.220
 so 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.410
 you have to be looking for variants still 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.970
 defensive solidity 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.270
 we have to return activity 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.490
 it seemed like we'll see 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.160
 fortunately we have two parties 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 regattas out 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.130
 of gold concluded south that they are two 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.300
 areas that have great strikers 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.490
 i more or less points 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.220
 acceptably well 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 tiger's occasion is still chords 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 and what the detectives say 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.330
 I think that the kids that came in came in well 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.230
 well something to Pablo García who had not done preseason 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.260
 nadal looked good chao chao máncora nowak 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 but he did not do it well 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 he did well both commodities 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 in the goal so quieter from the east 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.950
 common as it is 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.140
 I said at the beginning 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.550
 before the game not to give 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.780
 the coach to frames number of chips although it is very reliable 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870
 he was really an excellent goalkeeper 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.670
 He stands with great serenity despite his young age 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.470
 and his few matches at first 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 but that really gives us a lot of peace 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 - another we bring and pse-ee two seasons of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.590
 I was not there but 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.939
 this is not easy 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.939
 we could not shake 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.479
 lima I repeat now I wanted to be 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
 equipment situation 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.579
 it helps you a lot 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.919
 We could not go reinforcing 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.339
 not only do we have to fight against the current 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.699
 and we have to keep going 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.529
 that pressure to talk about 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.589
 we already know what it is about 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.509
 you can not stop 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.429
 I do not think we have 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.359
 another the biggest challenge 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.189
 that it seemed that they 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.189
 but now I twitter 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.609
 a lot, but
