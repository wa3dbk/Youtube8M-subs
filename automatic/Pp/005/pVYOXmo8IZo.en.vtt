00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
special app to control the kernel itself

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.910 
special app to control the kernel itself
so<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> paid<00:00:13.259> app<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.650> get<00:00:13.769> from

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
so this is a paid app you can get from

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.010

kind of nice actually there and you can
there's<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> feature<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> backup<00:00:48.300> your

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there's also a feature to a backup your

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
there's also a feature to a backup your
kernel<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> restore<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.039> hadn't

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
kernel and restore so if you hadn't

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.619 
kernel and restore so if you hadn't
stock<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> had<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.120> app<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.360> could

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
stock and you had this app you could

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.270 
stock and you had this app you could
back<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:52.050> current<00:00:52.350> colonel<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.129> can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
back up your current colonel you can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.650 
back up your current colonel you can
back<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> stock<00:00:53.820> kernel<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.210> restore<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
back up the stock kernel and restore it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
back up the stock kernel and restore it
if<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> wanted<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:55.739> let's<00:00:56.670> get

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
if you wanted to go back now let's get

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 
if you wanted to go back now let's get
into<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> main<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.320> kernel<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.920> we

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
into the main bit of this kernel so we

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.010 
into the main bit of this kernel so we
can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.579> frequencies<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.359> voltages<00:01:00.809> so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
can see here frequencies and voltages so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.130 
can see here frequencies and voltages so
let's<00:01:01.230> check<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.920> defaults<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.140> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
let's check out the defaults and it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830 
let's check out the defaults and it
comes<00:01:04.379> default<00:01:04.890> booting<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.270> stock

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
comes default booting it the stock

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
comes default booting it the stock
values<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> nexus<00:01:07.890> 4<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.430> 15<00:01:08.880> 12

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
values for the nexus 4 actually 15 12

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.929 
values for the nexus 4 actually 15 12
and<00:01:09.510> 3<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> 4<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> minimum<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.580> colonel

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and 3 a 4 is a minimum now the colonel

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
and 3 a 4 is a minimum now the colonel
doesn't<00:01:11.970> allow<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.479> any<00:01:12.720> overclocking<00:01:13.590> but

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
doesn't allow for any overclocking but

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.289 
doesn't allow for any overclocking but
that<00:01:13.860> doesn't<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.189> bother<00:01:14.400> me<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.850> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that doesn't really bother me because I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
that doesn't really bother me because I
actually<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> overclock<00:01:17.280> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
actually don't want to overclock this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
actually don't want to overclock this
phone<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:17.970> doesn't<00:01:18.299> need<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.960> that's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
phone you know doesn't need it so that's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
phone you know doesn't need it so that's
nice<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.220> fine<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.030> minimum<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> same

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
nice it's fine the minimum is the same

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.670 
nice it's fine the minimum is the same
you<00:01:22.110> can't<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.530> below<00:01:22.759> 384<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.380> that's<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you can't go below 384 and that's that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
you can't go below 384 and that's that
the<00:01:26.460> governor<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.200> uses<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.439> default<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the governor here uses as default is

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
the governor here uses as default is
interactive<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.119> different

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
interactive which is actually different

here<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.439> go<00:02:07.590> ok<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> micro

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
here we go ok so we can see the micro

here we go ok so we can see the micro

don't<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.790> you'll<00:02:11.910> notice<00:02:12.090> but

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
don't know if you'll notice but

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.229 
don't know if you'll notice but
isn't<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.620> under<00:02:13.950> mode<00:02:14.069> as<00:02:14.430> other<00:02:14.730> kernels

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
isn't as under mode as other kernels

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.280 
isn't as under mode as other kernels
except<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.910> 1026<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.300> frequency<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.080> is

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
except for 1026 this frequency here is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.199 
except for 1026 this frequency here is
kind<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.860> under<00:02:20.099> mode<00:02:20.250> quite<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> lot<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.180> he

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
kind of under mode quite a lot so he

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.150 
kind of under mode quite a lot so he
obviously<00:02:21.390> uses<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.050> frequency<00:02:22.500> kind<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
obviously uses this frequency kind of a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.420 
obviously uses this frequency kind of a
lot<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.150> he's<00:02:24.300> under<00:02:24.569> void<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.959> now<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.890> going

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
lot so he's under void it now I'm going

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.130 
lot so he's under void it now I'm going
to<00:02:26.489> leave<00:02:26.670> these<00:02:26.849> alone<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.629> what<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:27.959> want

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
to leave these alone but what I do want

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.380 
to leave these alone but what I do want
to<00:02:28.349> mention<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.280> example<00:02:29.670> Trinity<00:02:30.090> came

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
to mention is for example Trinity came

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960 
to mention is for example Trinity came
under<00:02:30.780> vaulted<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.860> these<00:02:32.010> two<00:02:32.340> frequencies

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
under vaulted for these two frequencies

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.479 
under vaulted for these two frequencies
here<00:02:33.290> 750<00:02:34.290> microvolts<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
here 750 microvolts but that was the

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.520 
here 750 microvolts but that was the
lowest<00:02:35.670> i<00:02:36.090> could<00:02:36.150> go<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.780> i<00:02:36.840> wanted<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.349> low

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
lowest i could go and i wanted to go low

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.839 
lowest i could go and i wanted to go low
because<00:02:37.739> i<00:02:37.860> think<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:38.099> friend<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.430> handle<00:02:38.760> it

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
because i think my friend can handle it

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.210 
because i think my friend can handle it
now<00:02:39.360> Franco<00:02:39.870> does<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.319> fact<00:02:40.349> let<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.830> go<00:02:40.980> lower

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
now Franco does in fact let you go lower

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.860 
now Franco does in fact let you go lower
and<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.640> prove<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.150> by<00:02:42.269> praying<00:02:42.569> for

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and I can prove it here by praying for

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.699 
and I can prove it here by praying for
example<00:02:43.260> 7<00:02:43.680> 30<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.319> does<00:02:46.530> in

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
example 7 30 and you can see it does in

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.339 
example 7 30 and you can see it does in
fact<00:02:46.739> stick<00:02:47.280> 730<00:02:47.940> microvolts<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:48.959> for

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
fact stick 730 microvolts is now for

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.380 
fact stick 730 microvolts is now for
that<00:02:49.500> frequency<00:02:50.489> now<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> don't<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.239> keep

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
that frequency now I don't want to keep

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.580 
that frequency now I don't want to keep
it<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.630> because<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.959> want<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> keep<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.500> as

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
it at that because I want to keep it as

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.020 
it at that because I want to keep it as
the<00:02:52.739> default<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.280> what<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.519> came<00:02:53.670> out<00:02:53.880> even

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the default of what it came out even

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.180 
the default of what it came out even
though<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.299> do<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.079> go<00:02:55.260> lower<00:02:55.470> so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
though I do think it can go lower so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.370 
though I do think it can go lower so
that<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> kind<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> nice<00:02:57.599> feature<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:58.110> can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
that is kind of a nice feature you can

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.350 
that is kind of a nice feature you can
have<00:02:58.680> lower<00:02:58.920> voltages<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> cpu<00:03:00.180> on

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
have lower voltages on the cpu on

have lower voltages on the cpu on

Livia took I was going to talk about
power<00:03:55.079> modes<00:03:55.350> but<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.530> talked<00:03:55.709> about<00:03:55.739> color

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
power modes but I talked about color

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.190 
power modes but I talked about color

control he already sets his own color

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.839 
control he already sets his own color
control<00:03:58.590> obviously<00:03:58.859> you<00:03:59.130> can<00:03:59.280> change<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.670> just

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849

like you could in Trinity you can see

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.949 
like you could in Trinity you can see
there's<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.560> nice<00:04:01.889> options<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:03.239> whites

version<00:04:07.769> which<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.430> actually<00:04:08.579> really<00:04:08.880> nice

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
version which is actually really nice

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.460 
version which is actually really nice
and<00:04:09.299> I'm<00:04:09.389> using<00:04:09.599> them<00:04:09.840> at<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:09.989> moment<00:04:10.349> and

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
and I'm using them at the moment and

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.339 
and I'm using them at the moment and
they<00:04:11.069> are<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.459> nice<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:12.569> colors<00:04:12.900> pop<00:04:12.930> it's

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
they are really nice the colors pop it's

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.690 
they are really nice the colors pop it's
all<00:04:13.500> good<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.160> I'm<00:04:14.250> going<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.400> leave<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.669> there

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
all good so I'm going to leave it there

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.390 
all good so I'm going to leave it there
you<00:04:14.910> can<00:04:14.940> also<00:04:15.269> save<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.930> load<00:04:15.989> whoops<00:04:16.620> save

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
and load your color profiles which I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.830 
and load your color profiles which I
find<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.289> be<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.470> really<00:04:19.709> nice<00:04:19.950> touch<00:04:20.539> now<00:04:21.539> power

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
find to be a really nice touch now power

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.260 
find to be a really nice touch now power
modes<00:04:22.400> theoretically<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.550> means<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.880> kind<00:04:24.210> of

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
modes theoretically it means you kind of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.240 
modes theoretically it means you kind of
make<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.510> power<00:04:24.840> saving<00:04:25.349> mode<00:04:25.380> which<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.950> tried

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
make a power saving mode which I tried

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.900 
make a power saving mode which I tried
here<00:04:26.520> back<00:04:26.700> to

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
here back to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.490 
here back to
saving<00:04:27.270> but<00:04:27.450> when<00:04:27.570> i<00:04:27.600> click<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.260> crashes

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
saving but when i click it just crashes

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.220 
saving but when i click it just crashes
so<00:04:28.800> that's<00:04:28.980> not<00:04:29.130> working<00:04:29.340> i'm<00:04:29.640> not<00:04:29.760> sure<00:04:29.940> why

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
so that's not working i'm not sure why

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.290 
so that's not working i'm not sure why
but<00:04:31.230> we've<00:04:31.680> also<00:04:31.830> got<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> device<00:04:32.520> monitor<00:04:33.090> down

go<00:04:41.760> away<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.240> leave<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.870> i<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.620> want

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
go away and leave you to it i just want

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.170 
go away and leave you to it i just want
to<00:04:43.800> show<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.010> something<00:04:44.340> that's<00:04:44.670> interesting

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
to show you something that's interesting

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.090 
to show you something that's interesting
about<00:04:45.240> franco.kernel<00:04:45.780> now<00:04:46.320> he<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.710> way<00:04:46.920> he

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
about franco.kernel now he the way he

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.040 
about franco.kernel now he the way he
does<00:04:47.280> stuff<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.790> he's<00:04:48.060> actually<00:04:48.240> gone<00:04:48.990> ahead

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
does stuff is he's actually gone ahead

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.470 
does stuff is he's actually gone ahead
and<00:04:49.290> decided<00:04:49.950> that<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.340> UI<00:04:50.550> really<00:04:51.240> only

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
and decided that the UI really only

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.050 
and decided that the UI really only
needs<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:52.170> cause<00:04:52.500> working<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.610> we<00:04:53.730> can<00:04:53.850> see

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
needs to cause working so we can see

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.660 
needs to cause working so we can see
here<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.780> 1st<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.380> 4th<00:04:55.770> Corps<00:04:56.130> are<00:04:56.400> online

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
here the 1st and 4th Corps are online

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.430 
here the 1st and 4th Corps are online
when<00:04:57.060> I'm<00:04:57.150> navigating<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.780> UI<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.080> can<00:04:58.260> see

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
when I'm navigating the UI you can see

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.500 
when I'm navigating the UI you can see
here<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:59.190> other<00:04:59.340> two<00:04:59.580> cores<00:04:59.880> don't<00:05:00.210> turn<00:05:00.480> on

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
here the other two cores don't turn on

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.660 
here the other two cores don't turn on
so<00:05:01.140> basically<00:05:01.650> we're<00:05:01.800> using<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.220> dual<00:05:02.460> core

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
so basically we're using a dual core

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.950 
so basically we're using a dual core
phone<00:05:02.970> right<00:05:03.150> now<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.450> should<00:05:03.690> save<00:05:03.930> some

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
phone right now it should save some

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.340 
phone right now it should save some
power<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:06.330> can<00:05:06.480> see<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.720> two<00:05:06.900> cores<00:05:07.140> don't

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
power you can see the two cores don't

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.690 
power you can see the two cores don't
come<00:05:07.470> online<00:05:07.710> they'll<00:05:07.920> only<00:05:08.100> really<00:05:08.490> come

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
come online they'll only really come

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.180 
come online they'll only really come
online<00:05:09.060> when<00:05:09.750> they<00:05:09.960> need<00:05:10.170> to<00:05:10.320> so<00:05:10.590> something<00:05:10.920> if

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
online when they need to so something if

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.770 
online when they need to so something if
i<00:05:11.280> open<00:05:11.400> an<00:05:11.610> app<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.000> needs<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.300> use<00:05:12.570> more

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
i open an app and it needs to use more

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.960 
i open an app and it needs to use more
juice<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.710> didn't<00:05:14.160> there<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.640> didn't<00:05:14.850> open

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
juice it didn't there so it didn't open

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.640 
juice it didn't there so it didn't open
that<00:05:15.180> they<00:05:15.510> go<00:05:15.690> now<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:16.050> four<00:05:16.320> cores<00:05:16.560> are

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
that they go now all four cores are

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.760 
that they go now all four cores are
online<00:05:17.570> but<00:05:18.570> most<00:05:18.780> of<00:05:18.930> time<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.230> is<00:05:19.260> just<00:05:19.560> using

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
online but most of time it is just using

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.330 
online but most of time it is just using
two<00:05:20.040> cords<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:21.420> far<00:05:21.720> it's<00:05:22.260> fine<00:05:22.860> you<00:05:23.040> know<00:05:23.100> it

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
two cords so far it's fine you know it

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.160 
two cords so far it's fine you know it
seems<00:05:23.520> pretty<00:05:23.970> snappy<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.480> wouldn't<00:05:24.900> say<00:05:25.020> it's

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
seems pretty snappy I wouldn't say it's

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.640 
seems pretty snappy I wouldn't say it's
quite<00:05:25.470> as<00:05:25.650> snappy<00:05:26.070> as<00:05:27.140> Trinity's<00:05:28.140> velasquez

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
quite as snappy as Trinity's velasquez

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.620 
quite as snappy as Trinity's velasquez
Trinity's<00:05:29.040> using<00:05:29.520> all<00:05:29.670> four<00:05:29.880> cores<00:05:30.180> at<00:05:30.360> most

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
Trinity's using all four cores at most

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.710 
Trinity's using all four cores at most
the<00:05:30.780> time<00:05:31.020> but<00:05:31.850> let's<00:05:32.850> see<00:05:33.060> how<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.330> goes<00:05:33.420> you

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
the time but let's see how this goes you

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.000 
the time but let's see how this goes you
know<00:05:33.810> this<00:05:33.960> might<00:05:34.170> save<00:05:34.440> some<00:05:34.470> more<00:05:34.770> power

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
know this might save some more power

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.950 
know this might save some more power
it's<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.520> nice<00:05:35.700> feature<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.120> try<00:05:36.480> out<00:05:36.660> you<00:05:36.840> can

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
it's a nice feature to try out you can

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.440 
it's a nice feature to try out you can
see<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.260> two<00:05:37.410> cause<00:05:37.680> online<00:05:38.460> all<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:38.970> time

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
see the two cause online all the time

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.150 
see the two cause online all the time
and<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.930> other<00:05:40.050> two<00:05:40.230> are<00:05:40.290> off<00:05:40.530> most<00:05:40.890> of<00:05:41.040> the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
and the other two are off most of the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.310 
and the other two are off most of the
time<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:41.790> that<00:05:42.210> is<00:05:42.360> something<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.780> note<00:05:43.080> there

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
time so that is something to note there

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.670 
time so that is something to note there
guys<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:44.240> yeah<00:05:45.240> that's<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:46.050> franco.kernel

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
guys and yeah that's the franco.kernel

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.650 
guys and yeah that's the franco.kernel
for<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.130> nexus<00:05:47.430> 4<00:05:47.640> we'll<00:05:47.880> see<00:05:48.060> how<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.240> does<00:05:48.480> in

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
for the nexus 4 we'll see how it does in

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.050 
for the nexus 4 we'll see how it does in
the<00:05:48.750> next<00:05:48.990> few<00:05:49.140> days<00:05:49.350> stay<00:05:50.340> tuned<00:05:50.610> guys<00:05:50.790> for

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the next few days stay tuned guys for

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.510 
the next few days stay tuned guys for
the<00:05:51.090> results
