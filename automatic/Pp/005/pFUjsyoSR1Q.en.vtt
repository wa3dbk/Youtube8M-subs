00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
been they've been in there that's

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.180 
been they've been in there that's
another<00:03:39.720> phase<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.350> life<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.680> don't<00:03:40.799> see<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.100> as

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
another phase of life we don't see it as

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.190 
another phase of life we don't see it as
death<00:03:41.459> we<00:03:41.670> see<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.090> another<00:03:42.209> stop<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
death we see that as another stop in the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.620 
death we see that as another stop in the
journey<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.560> life<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.489> when<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.819> compare<00:03:45.389> all

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
journey of life so when you compare all

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.300 
journey of life so when you compare all
these<00:03:45.840> stops<00:03:46.139> in<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.470> journey<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.859> life<00:03:47.040> you

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
these stops in the journey of life you

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.970 
these stops in the journey of life you
would<00:03:47.430> realize<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.810> life<00:03:49.139> meaning

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
would realize that this life meaning

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.059 
would realize that this life meaning
from<00:03:50.130> my<00:03:50.310> birth<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.790> my<00:03:50.940> worldly<00:03:51.720> death<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.859> the

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
from my birth to my worldly death is the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.400 
from my birth to my worldly death is the
shortest<00:03:53.459> stop<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.849> this<00:03:53.970> journey<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.959> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
shortest stop in this journey so the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.680 
shortest stop in this journey so the
shortest<00:03:55.739> span<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.700> know<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.450> don't<00:03:57.569> even

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
shortest span you know you don't even

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.289 
shortest span you know you don't even
realize<00:03:58.049> when<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.380> over<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:59.130> know<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.430> so

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
realize when it's over you know and so

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.330 
realize when it's over you know and so
when<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.900> realize<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.319> then<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.190> also

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
when you realize that then you also

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.879 
when you realize that then you also
realize<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:03.000> tiniest<00:04:03.569> space<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.500> tiniest

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
realize this tiniest space this tiniest

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.379 
realize this tiniest space this tiniest
lifetime<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.489> have<00:04:05.700> spent<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.239> have

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
lifetime that I have spent that I have

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.390 
lifetime that I have spent that I have
this<00:04:07.109> is<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.680> will<00:04:07.799> determine<00:04:08.069> all

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
this is the one that will determine all

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.210 
this is the one that will determine all
of<00:04:08.430> my<00:04:08.639> actions<00:04:09.000> in

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
of my actions in

future my eternal life is based on this

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.090 
future my eternal life is based on this

it<00:04:28.210> destroys<00:04:28.960> laziness<00:04:29.530> inside<00:04:29.890> me<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:30.610> I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
it destroys laziness inside me so if I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.030 
it destroys laziness inside me so if I
find<00:04:30.970> Muslims<00:04:31.810> in<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.230> audience<00:04:32.560> if<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.800> find

find Muslims in the audience if you find

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.370 
find Muslims in the audience if you find
yourself<00:04:33.430> being<00:04:33.580> lazy<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.630> have<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.110> ask

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
yourself being lazy and you have to ask

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.190 
yourself being lazy and you have to ask
whether<00:04:35.920> or<00:04:36.190> not<00:04:36.340> your<00:04:36.580> your<00:04:37.000> beliefs<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:38.080> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
afterlife are concrete enough maybe you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.880 
afterlife are concrete enough maybe you
need<00:04:40.480> more<00:04:40.660> reminder<00:04:41.170> about<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.410> afterlife

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
need more reminder about the afterlife

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.820 
need more reminder about the afterlife
