your clock now depending on certain
aspects<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.310> may<00:03:22.579> need<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.880> reboot<00:03:23.230> which<00:03:24.579> we

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
aspects you may need to reboot which we

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.870 
aspects you may need to reboot which we
are<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.150> do<00:03:26.299> right<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.610> when<00:03:28.850> we

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
are going to do right now and when we

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.810 
are going to do right now and when we
reboot<00:03:29.420> out<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.079> she'll<00:03:30.290> be<00:03:30.440> there<00:03:30.760> ok<00:03:31.760> so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
reboot out the it she'll be there ok so

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.210 
reboot out the it she'll be there ok so
I've<00:03:32.030> just<00:03:32.209> rebooted<00:03:32.720> now<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.110> know<00:03:33.950> we're<00:03:34.100> just

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
I've just rebooted now I know we're just

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.650 
I've just rebooted now I know we're just
going<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.519> if<00:03:34.610> it's<00:03:34.730> there<00:03:34.910> if<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.630> can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
going to see if it's there if you can

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.630 
going to see if it's there if you can
see<00:03:35.780> your<00:03:35.989> widgets<00:03:36.350> or<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.130> get<00:03:37.280> your<00:03:37.370> widgets

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
see your widgets or you get your widgets

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.970 
see your widgets or you get your widgets
up<00:03:37.760> you'll<00:03:38.390> see<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.110> under<00:03:39.500> analog

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
up you'll see that it's under analog

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.890 
up you'll see that it's under analog
clock<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.700> will<00:03:40.790> be<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.480> one<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
clock so it will be a be one of the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.830 
clock so it will be a be one of the
first<00:03:42.140> widget<00:03:42.980> she'll<00:03:43.310> probably<00:03:43.489> have<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.750> we

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
first widget she'll probably have so we

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.970 
first widget she'll probably have so we
will<00:03:44.900> just<00:03:44.959> place<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.290> onto<00:03:45.590> our<00:03:45.829> home

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
will just place that onto our home

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.940 
will just place that onto our home
screen<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:48.040> there<00:03:49.040> we<00:03:49.220> are<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.970> working

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
screen and there we are it's working

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.319 
screen and there we are it's working
obviously<00:03:51.950> depending<00:03:52.430> on<00:03:52.640> what<00:03:53.000> version

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
obviously depending on what version

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.210 
obviously depending on what version
