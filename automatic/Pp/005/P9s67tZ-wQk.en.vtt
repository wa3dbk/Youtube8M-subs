00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
anyways a front panel seemed now to be

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.320 
anyways a front panel seemed now to be
much<00:01:15.410> longer<00:01:15.710> than<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.160> iphone<00:01:16.520> 4s<00:01:16.970> they're

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
much longer than the iphone 4s they're

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.690 
much longer than the iphone 4s they're
not<00:01:17.480> really<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> why<00:01:18.560> now<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.520> may

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
not really going to why now is it may

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.460 
not really going to why now is it may
seem<00:01:19.970> like<00:01:20.150> they're<00:01:20.330> going<00:01:20.510> for<00:01:20.690> 16<00:01:21.110> by<00:01:21.260> 9

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
seem like they're going for 16 by 9

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.500 
seem like they're going for 16 by 9
resolution<00:01:22.100> whereas<00:01:22.370> i<00:01:22.460> believe<00:01:22.700> before<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
resolution whereas i believe before the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.600 
resolution whereas i believe before the
iphone<00:01:23.930> 4s<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.740> everything<00:01:25.130> previous

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
iphone 4s and everything previous

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.480 
iphone 4s and everything previous
iphones<00:01:25.970> had<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> 4<00:01:27.110> by<00:01:27.260> 3<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:27.770> resolution<00:01:28.250> i

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
iphones had a 4 by 3 is a resolution i

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.860 
iphones had a 4 by 3 is a resolution i
believe<00:01:28.790> correct<00:01:29.090> me<00:01:29.240> if<00:01:29.330> i'm<00:01:29.480> wrong<00:01:29.510> but<00:01:29.690> i

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
believe correct me if i'm wrong but i

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.170 
believe correct me if i'm wrong but i
think<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.230> was<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.410> aspect<00:01:30.860> ratio<00:01:31.190> but<00:01:32.030> now

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
think that was a aspect ratio but now

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.330 
think that was a aspect ratio but now
this<00:01:32.420> new<00:01:32.690> one<00:01:32.900> seems<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.350> be<00:01:33.440> having<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.770> 16<00:01:34.159> by

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
this new one seems to be having a 16 by

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.220 
this new one seems to be having a 16 by
9<00:01:34.550> aspect<00:01:34.730> ratio<00:01:35.240> which<00:01:35.390> goes<00:01:35.630> in<00:01:35.840> line<00:01:36.020> with

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
9 aspect ratio which goes in line with

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.800 
9 aspect ratio which goes in line with
more<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.680> android<00:01:37.130> phones<00:01:37.450> for<00:01:38.450> example

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
more of the android phones for example

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
down below in the comment section it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.340 
down below in the comment section it

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
seems like apples also making the black

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.230 
seems like apples also making the black
and<00:01:57.590> white<00:01:57.890> white<00:01:58.220> version<00:01:58.580> at<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.820> same<00:01:59.030> time

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and white white version at the same time

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.000 
and white white version at the same time
dis<00:01:59.510> time<00:01:59.659> so<00:01:59.810> no<00:01:59.930> they're<00:02:00.409> not<00:02:00.530> going<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.890> be

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
dis time so no they're not going to be

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.610 
dis time so no they're not going to be
releasing<00:02:01.430> black<00:02:01.729> first<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.299> then<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.440> white

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
releasing black first and then the white

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
second like a year later like they did

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.440
