00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.870 
a recipe like something like this or a
spice<00:05:36.240> or<00:05:37.920> something<00:05:38.920> and<00:05:39.040> like<00:05:39.100> I<00:05:39.280> taste<00:05:39.610> it

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
spice or something and like I taste it

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.750 
spice or something and like I taste it
if<00:05:40.060> it's<00:05:40.270> new<00:05:40.540> to<00:05:40.750> me<00:05:40.890> later<00:05:41.890> when<00:05:42.190> I<00:05:42.250> make<00:05:42.580> the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
if it's new to me later when I make the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.660 
if it's new to me later when I make the
recipe<00:05:43.050> it's<00:05:44.050> like<00:05:44.320> all<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.620> taste<00:05:45.160> in<00:05:45.550> the

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
recipe it's like all I taste in the

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.130 
recipe it's like all I taste in the
recipe<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:48.070> kind<00:05:48.310> of<00:05:48.370> ruins<00:05:48.760> it<00:05:48.910> for<00:05:48.940> me<00:05:49.180> so

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
recipe and it kind of ruins it for me so

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.570 
recipe and it kind of ruins it for me so
if<00:05:50.620> I<00:05:50.830> tasted<00:05:51.400> this<00:05:51.640> like<00:05:52.540> by<00:05:52.780> itself<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.740> then

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
if I tasted this like by itself and then

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.310 
if I tasted this like by itself and then
I<00:05:54.610> didn't<00:05:55.030> like<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.450> then<00:05:55.990> when<00:05:56.290> I<00:05:56.320> made<00:05:56.680> my

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
I didn't like it then when I made my

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.950 
I didn't like it then when I made my
nutria<00:05:59.320> blasts<00:05:59.980> I<00:06:00.570> wouldn't<00:06:01.570> like<00:06:01.720> those

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
nutria blasts I wouldn't like those

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.420 
nutria blasts I wouldn't like those
either<00:06:02.110> because<00:06:02.500> all<00:06:02.650> I<00:06:02.680> would<00:06:02.980> taste<00:06:03.190> would

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
either because all I would taste would

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.100 
either because all I would taste would
be<00:06:03.610> this<00:06:03.790> taste<00:06:04.150> that<00:06:04.360> I<00:06:04.420> didn't<00:06:04.750> like<00:06:04.900> in

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
be this taste that I didn't like in

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.800 
be this taste that I didn't like in
there<00:06:05.290> so<00:06:06.160> I'm<00:06:06.190> actually<00:06:06.670> going<00:06:06.940> to<00:06:07.300> wait

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
there so I'm actually going to wait

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.700 
there so I'm actually going to wait
until<00:06:08.320> I<00:06:09.070> get<00:06:09.190> my<00:06:09.490> nutribullet<00:06:10.110> before<00:06:11.110> I<00:06:11.140> try

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
until I get my nutribullet before I try

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.610 
until I get my nutribullet before I try
it<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.510> at<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.750> time<00:06:13.810> i'm<00:06:14.200> pretty<00:06:14.410> sure<00:06:14.590> that

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
it and at that time i'm pretty sure that

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.370 
it and at that time i'm pretty sure that
i<00:06:14.860> love<00:06:15.100> it<00:06:15.250> because<00:06:15.600> it<00:06:16.600> just<00:06:16.780> looks<00:06:17.050> really
