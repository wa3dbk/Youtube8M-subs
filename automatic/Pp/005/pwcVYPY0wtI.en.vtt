and what we're gonna do is we're going

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.720 
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:45.600> keep<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.290> boiling<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.190> running<00:03:47.549> for

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
to just keep it boiling and running for

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.240 
to just keep it boiling and running for
another<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:48.390> fifteen<00:03:49.049> or<00:03:49.830> twenty<00:03:50.220> minutes

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
another like fifteen or twenty minutes

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
give it another quick stir just so that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.580 
give it another quick stir just so that
vegetables<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.180> cook<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.780> bit<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:56.570> and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
vegetables can cook a little bit and and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.100 
vegetables can cook a little bit and and
yeah<00:03:58.590> just<00:03:58.950> give<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.220> another<00:03:59.640> 15<00:04:00.600> minutes<00:04:00.959> or

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
yeah just give it another 15 minutes or

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.440 
yeah just give it another 15 minutes or
so<00:04:01.350> for<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.709> cook<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.310> then<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.000> should<00:04:03.209> be

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
so for it to cook and then it should be

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.490 
so for it to cook and then it should be
ready

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
ready

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.530 
ready
so<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.460> is<00:04:05.640> what<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.940> finished<00:04:06.120> product

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
so this is what the finished product

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.420 
so this is what the finished product
look<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.290> let<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.560> go<00:04:07.740> for<00:04:07.770> another<00:04:08.100> 20

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
look like I let it go for another 20

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.610 
look like I let it go for another 20
minutes<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.090> these<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.690> all<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.020> vegetables

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
minutes and these are all the vegetables

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.890 
minutes and these are all the vegetables
and<00:04:10.830> if<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.250> see<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.880> meat<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.840> to

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
and if you can see the meat is going to

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.610 
and if you can see the meat is going to
be<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.140> little<00:04:13.410> bit<00:04:13.650> darkish<00:04:14.250> brownish<00:04:14.730> color

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
be a little bit darkish brownish color

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.710 
be a little bit darkish brownish color
because<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.769> has<00:04:16.980> that<00:04:17.160> soy<00:04:17.459> sauce<00:04:17.790> flavor<00:04:18.299> in

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
because it has that soy sauce flavor in

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.069 
because it has that soy sauce flavor in
there<00:04:19.290> as<00:04:19.560> well<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.359> cooking<00:04:21.359> wine<00:04:21.570> and

there as well as that cooking wine and

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.900 
there as well as that cooking wine and
then<00:04:22.230> all<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.560> veggies<00:04:23.010> are<00:04:23.040> tender<00:04:23.280> and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
then all the veggies are tender and

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.690 
then all the veggies are tender and
really<00:04:24.570> really<00:04:24.720> good<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:26.070> meat<00:04:26.310> should

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
really really good and the meat should

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.200 
really really good and the meat should
be<00:04:26.730> fall<00:04:27.420> off<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.930> bone<00:04:28.280> type<00:04:29.280> tenderness<00:04:29.790> so
