the price a lot of robot vacuums we've

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.700 
the price a lot of robot vacuums we've
tested<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.330> pretty<00:00:21.330> basic<00:00:21.960> functionality

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
tested have pretty basic functionality

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.590 
tested have pretty basic functionality
they<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> spot<00:00:24.029> cleaning<00:00:24.300> mode

and a regular cleaning mode and that's

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.950 
and a regular cleaning mode and that's
about<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
about it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
about it
instead<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.170> robot<00:00:28.529> vacuum<00:00:28.920> goes<00:00:29.130> way

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
instead this robot vacuum goes way

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
instead this robot vacuum goes way
beyond<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> max<00:00:30.840> cleaning

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
beyond that they have a max cleaning

mode a regular mode a mop mode all kinds
of<00:00:35.340> special<00:00:35.550> features<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.840> makes<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
of special features and that makes it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
of special features and that makes it
really<00:00:37.290> cool<00:00:37.559> also<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.399> terms<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> features<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
really cool also in terms of features it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
really cool also in terms of features it
has<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.600> side<00:00:39.809> brushes<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> more<00:00:40.829> than

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
has two side brushes which is more than

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.810 
has two side brushes which is more than
neato<00:00:41.550> bot<00:00:41.820> bag<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.360> AI<00:00:42.390> robots<00:00:42.989> Roomba<00:00:43.469> brand

neato bot bag or AI robots Roomba brand

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.130 
neato bot bag or AI robots Roomba brand
but<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> mop<00:00:45.870> feature

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
but I really think that the mop feature

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
but I really think that the mop feature
stands<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> most<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> robot

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
stands out the most it's really a robot

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
stands out the most it's really a robot
vacuum<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> has<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.320> special<00:00:49.530> feature

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
vacuum but it has this special feature

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
vacuum but it has this special feature
that<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.460> robot<00:00:50.760> vacuums<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that a lot of robot vacuums don't you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
that a lot of robot vacuums don't you
can<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.649> microfiber<00:00:53.160> cloth<00:00:53.579> dry<00:00:54.090> for

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
can use this microfiber cloth dry for

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990 
can use this microfiber cloth dry for
dusting<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.440> floor<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.460> wet<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
dusting the floor or you can wet it and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
dusting the floor or you can wet it and
use<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> mop<00:00:58.320> unfortunately<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
use it kind of as a mop unfortunately it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
use it kind of as a mop unfortunately it
doesn't<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.030> water<00:01:00.300> reservoir<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.079> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
doesn't have a water reservoir so it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
doesn't have a water reservoir so it's
not<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.559> full-fledged<00:01:01.829> mop<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.359> get

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
not a full-fledged mop but it can get

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.710 
not a full-fledged mop but it can get
kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.930> basic<00:01:04.890> maintenance<00:01:05.360> with<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.510> those

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
kind of basic maintenance with all those

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.880 
kind of basic maintenance with all those
features<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.200> had<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.500> pretty<00:01:07.619> high

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
features I had some pretty high

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.730 
features I had some pretty high
expectations<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.939> robot<00:01:09.330> vacuum

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
expectations for this robot vacuum

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.840 
expectations for this robot vacuum
unfortunately<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.950> didn't<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.460> well<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
unfortunately it didn't do very well in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.179 
unfortunately it didn't do very well in
our<00:01:12.000> performance<00:01:12.510> tests<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.950> scored

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
our performance tests it actually scored

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
our performance tests it actually scored
the<00:01:14.280> lowest<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> three

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the lowest in two out of the three

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.990 
the lowest in two out of the three
categories<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.290> tested<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.040> did<00:01:17.400> better<00:01:17.729> than

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
categories we tested it did better than

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.539 
categories we tested it did better than
the<00:01:18.060> infinite<00:01:18.630> ohoho<00:01:19.049> 5/10<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.890> pet<00:01:20.130> hair<00:01:20.340> but

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the infinite ohoho 5/10 on pet hair but

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.670 
the infinite ohoho 5/10 on pet hair but
that's<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.570> 510<00:01:22.080> wasn't<00:01:22.470> able

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that's just because the 510 wasn't able

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.039 
that's just because the 510 wasn't able
to<00:01:22.770> pick<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.070> any<00:01:23.280> pet<00:01:23.549> hair<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.540> far<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.900> its

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to pick up any pet hair as far as its

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.890 
to pick up any pet hair as far as its
mop<00:01:25.229> capabilities<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.340> okay<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.570> tend<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
mop capabilities it did okay we tend to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510 
mop capabilities it did okay we tend to
push<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> limits<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.920> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
push it to the limits a little bit so I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
push it to the limits a little bit so I
spilled<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> good<00:01:30.119> bit<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.299> coffee<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> wet

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
spilled a good bit of coffee for the wet

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260 
spilled a good bit of coffee for the wet
test<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.340> sort<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.909> spread<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
test and it sort of just spread it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
test and it sort of just spread it
around<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.720> room<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.650> sticky

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
around the room and got really a sticky

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
around the room and got really a sticky
coating<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.939> coffee<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> creamer<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
coating of coffee and creamer on the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.950 
coating of coffee and creamer on the
floor<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> dry<00:01:38.909> mop<00:01:39.119> test<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> spread<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
floor for the dry mop test I spread a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
floor for the dry mop test I spread a
bunch<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.290> cornstarch<00:01:40.770> around<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> kind
