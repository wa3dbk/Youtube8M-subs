00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180
 with you the game is called smash hit let's 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.160
 move on this game was for me 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 frank revelation lest it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 meant because this game is so 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.399
 addictive it's just some kind of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.350
 horror see from the game to the horror we just 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.940
 move along such a tunnel in which we 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 you must collect crystals with you 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.449
 rushing on it with such balls of us 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.850
 there is a certain amount above 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 balls at a certain level ie 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 here we are one level and how can 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.150
 further if we pass it will of course 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 same better and in general here and so we 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 must advance on our path will 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.970
 all sorts of barriers bonuses here we are now 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.479
 we see that I throw two balls for 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.650
 once i took the bonus and in general 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.630
 It will also appear this barrier 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.009
 doors and glass that we can 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 break it all develops very 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.240
 cool that is, from the game alone 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.990
 positive impressions and drag on 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.189

 yourself must fight the levels here 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.470
 the mass of which heroes and in principle these 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.660
 heroes have their own unique abilities 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.280
 Here, for example, and archer me all there 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.930
 our data skills which we will be with 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.060
 you pump over in the course of passage 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.670
 and there are also ordinary soldiers who 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.819
 move around and at the end if the enemy is standing 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.829
 in the field of action he will be his 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.230
 sword in the game everything happens on the moves 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.540
 first we go with you then we will be ours 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.579

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.889
 was leaving my rival now let me 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.109
 apply let's say my 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.030

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.650
 Opponent games adapted by type 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.389
 devices free in the appstore pretty 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 interesting to call it all did 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.510
 line heart 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.370
 The next game is called adventure and 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.530
 let me go and the meaning of this game 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.690
 very simple in the first place it is runners we 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.950
 run with you on the level to the left of will 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.440
 jump right 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.410
 we will press we will shoot and in general 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.410
 then if we press to the left we say three times then 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.690
 our character with you will fly much 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.579
 higher than he just jumps 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.680
 naturally our mission is very simple 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.079
 it is to avoid all the obstacles to kill 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.760
 all enemies shooting at them because of our 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.260
 guns that we have and collect as 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.349
 can be more of the most coins well and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.810
 of course run away as far as possible the game 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.090
 free adaptive on device type 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.720
 You can play on the iPhone on the ipad 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.280
 equally fun but sometimes it infuriates 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.170
 when you kill the game called 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.150
 adventure 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.310
 and the last game for today is called 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.320
 on davis danzhen let's go this 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.209
 the game is made in pixel style 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.120
 control is very simple it's two 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.980
 buttons left right left and button a and 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.320
 without the help of which we can jump and 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.810
 hack our rivals in small 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.730
 the pieces are they on the right general what 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.060
 we will do we have to go from the beginning 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.020
 level to the end avoiding all obstacles 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
 all our enemies 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.610
 can knead our enemies for meat and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.320
 Generally at the end we ourselves must find 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.240
 keys and with which we will open 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.760
 doors to another level and so we will 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.979
 advance through the game and years 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.870
