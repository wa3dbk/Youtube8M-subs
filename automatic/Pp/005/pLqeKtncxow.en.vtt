00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
concentrate a little bit longer and a

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.070 
concentrate a little bit longer and a
little<00:02:02.170> bit<00:02:02.350> harder<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:02.890> seems<00:02:03.160> I<00:02:03.869> made<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.900> good

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
little bit harder it seems I made a good

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.999 
little bit harder it seems I made a good
dent<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.590> book<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:08.170> was<00:02:08.500> able<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.830> make

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
dent in that book and I was able to make

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.810 
dent in that book and I was able to make
the<00:02:09.450> preceding<00:02:10.450> 3d<00:02:10.899> animation<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.490> homage<00:02:12.790> to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
the preceding 3d animation and homage to

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.620 
the preceding 3d animation and homage to
the<00:02:14.250> logo<00:02:15.420> monograms<00:02:16.420> 30<00:02:16.750> house<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> 30s

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the logo monograms 30 house in the 30s

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.270 
the logo monograms 30 house in the 30s
so<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.930> think<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.380> helping<00:02:20.739> I'm<00:02:20.980> going<00:02:21.190> to
