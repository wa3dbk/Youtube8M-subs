00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.990 
first platform layer because this class
was<00:02:38.209> kind<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.750> made<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.140> layers<00:02:39.430> because<00:02:40.430> one

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
was kind of made in layers because one

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.050 
was kind of made in layers because one
two<00:02:41.330> three<00:02:42.520> four<00:02:43.520> layers<00:02:43.850> overall<00:02:44.450> i<00:02:44.630> can<00:02:45.020> see

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
two three four layers overall i can see

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.460 
two three four layers overall i can see
not<00:02:47.060> sure<00:02:47.180> about<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.600> fountain

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
not sure about this fountain

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.690 
not sure about this fountain
it's<00:02:48.650> kind<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.160> way<00:02:49.310> when<00:02:49.610> you're

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
it's kind of in a way when you're

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.560 
it's kind of in a way when you're
walking<00:02:49.880> around<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:51.500> guess<00:02:52.370> you're<00:02:53.210> kind<00:02:53.270> of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
walking around I guess you're kind of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.410 
walking around I guess you're kind of
limited<00:02:54.140> with<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.400> space<00:02:55.670> when<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.090> comes<00:02:56.270> to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
limited with this space when it comes to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.390 
limited with this space when it comes to
small<00:02:56.630> plots<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.530> I'm<00:02:57.590> not<00:02:57.650> complaining<00:02:57.920> not

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
small plots so I'm not complaining not

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.400 
small plots so I'm not complaining not
complaining<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.150> detail<00:02:59.510> Bell<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.960> very<00:03:00.230> nice

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
complaining the detail Bell is very nice

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.610 
complaining the detail Bell is very nice
it's<00:03:00.890> more<00:03:01.340> kind<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.240> both<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.290> depth

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
it's more kind of both of the depth

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.790 
it's more kind of both of the depth
detailing<00:03:04.460> instead<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:04.910> just<00:03:05.800> detailed

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
detailing instead of just detailed

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.910 
detailing instead of just detailed
detailing<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.640> makes<00:03:07.910> any<00:03:08.090> sense<00:03:08.240> I'm<00:03:09.080> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
detailing that makes any sense I'm the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.100 
detailing that makes any sense I'm the
tree<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.190> there<00:03:10.460> very<00:03:11.090> nicely<00:03:11.300> made<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.810> never

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
tree is there very nicely made I never

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.710 
tree is there very nicely made I never
thought<00:03:12.200> about<00:03:12.790> doing<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:14.090> basically

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
thought about doing this basically

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.840 
thought about doing this basically
putting<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.140> glass<00:03:15.380> block<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.890> then<00:03:15.980> putting

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
putting a glass block and then putting

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.780 
putting a glass block and then putting
some<00:03:17.600> grass<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.050> top<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.590> well<00:03:19.490> in<00:03:19.670> this

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
some grass on top of it well in this

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.030 
some grass on top of it well in this
case<00:03:20.000> double<00:03:20.300> tall<00:03:20.450> grass<00:03:20.750> which<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.350> really

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
case double tall grass which is really

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.520 
case double tall grass which is really
nice<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.760> gives<00:03:22.820> us<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.450> nice<00:03:23.690> effect<00:03:23.870> makes<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
nice it gives us a nice effect makes the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.680 
nice it gives us a nice effect makes the
trees<00:03:24.800> look<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.340> little<00:03:25.490> bit<00:03:25.700> more<00:03:25.970> pushy<00:03:26.360> I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
trees look a little bit more pushy I

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.010 
trees look a little bit more pushy I
guess<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:28.400> would<00:03:28.670> help<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.120> show<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.660> effect

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
guess it would help to show that effect

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.740 
guess it would help to show that effect
if<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.320> didn't<00:03:30.560> have<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:31.100> better<00:03:31.940> foliage<00:03:32.480> mod

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
if I didn't have the better foliage mod

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.980 
if I didn't have the better foliage mod
which<00:03:33.470> basically<00:03:34.160> combines<00:03:34.580> a<00:03:35.180> grass<00:03:35.600> block

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
which basically combines a grass block

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.390 
which basically combines a grass block
with<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.160> leaf<00:03:37.400> block<00:03:37.780> makes<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.250> look<00:03:40.250> like

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
with a leaf block makes it look like

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.940 
with a leaf block makes it look like
this<00:03:40.600> which<00:03:41.600> makes<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.020> trees<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.470> all<00:03:42.680> them

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
this which makes the trees and all them

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.040 
this which makes the trees and all them
the<00:03:43.640> leaves<00:03:43.940> look<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:44.600> really<00:03:44.780> awesome

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
the leaves look really really awesome

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.140 
the leaves look really really awesome
and<00:03:45.590> they<00:03:45.800> really<00:03:46.040> love<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.490> like<00:03:46.940> how<00:03:46.970> the

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
and they really love it I like how the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.620 
and they really love it I like how the
vines<00:03:47.600> are<00:03:47.930> kind<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.350> just<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:48.880> only<00:03:49.880> in<00:03:50.300> few

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
vines are kind of just like only in few

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.420 
vines are kind of just like only in few
places<00:03:50.660> because<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.530> see<00:03:51.740> that<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:51.950> lot<00:03:52.010> that

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
places because I see that a lot that

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.420 
places because I see that a lot that
people<00:03:52.459> just<00:03:52.940> like<00:03:53.290> vines<00:03:54.290> everywhere<00:03:54.590> all

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
people just like vines everywhere all

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.190 
people just like vines everywhere all
over<00:03:55.580> there<00:03:55.910> bailed<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.390> don't<00:03:56.570> like<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.810> to

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
over there bailed I don't like that to

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.350 
over there bailed I don't like that to
be<00:03:57.230> honest<00:03:57.620> but<00:03:57.800> this<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.190> like<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.209> a

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
be honest but this I like this I like a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.500 
be honest but this I like this I like a
lot<00:03:59.720> how<00:03:59.989> it's<00:04:00.320> only<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.980> certain<00:04:01.370> spots<00:04:01.730> which

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
lot how it's only in certain spots which

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.180 
lot how it's only in certain spots which
makes<00:04:02.750> kind<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.080> sense<00:04:03.350> because<00:04:03.530> like<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:04.010> mean

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
makes kind of sense because like I mean

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.790 
makes kind of sense because like I mean
this<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.580> just<00:04:04.780> grass<00:04:05.780> here<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.470> I'm<00:04:06.530> assuming

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
this is just grass here so I'm assuming

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.300 
this is just grass here so I'm assuming
this<00:04:07.430> castle<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:07.910> part<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.330> some<00:04:08.540> serve<00:04:08.750> like<00:04:08.989> a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
this castle is part of some serve like a

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.650 
this castle is part of some serve like a
huge<00:04:10.310> cliff<00:04:10.850> or<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:13.060> mountain<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.180> some<00:04:14.360> sort

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
huge cliff or a mountain of some sort

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.710 
huge cliff or a mountain of some sort
because<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.530> has<00:04:16.090> grass<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.330> all<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.570> these

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
because it has grass and all of these

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.080 
because it has grass and all of these
layers<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:20.209> top<00:04:20.269> four<00:04:20.870> you've<00:04:20.900> got<00:04:21.290> even<00:04:21.620> more

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
layers on top four you've got even more

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.840 
layers on top four you've got even more
grass<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.419> such<00:04:24.100> quite<00:04:25.100> nice<00:04:25.280> view<00:04:25.490> throw<00:04:25.729> up

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
grass and such quite nice view throw up

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.219 
grass and such quite nice view throw up
here<00:04:26.150> it's<00:04:26.720> quite<00:04:26.900> tall<00:04:27.200> this<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:29.229> structure

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
here it's quite tall this this structure

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.690 
here it's quite tall this this structure

nice tower and a corner as well and yeah

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.360 
nice tower and a corner as well and yeah
this<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.050> pretty<00:04:36.169> much<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.440> this<00:04:36.890> book<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.220> mean

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
this is pretty much it this book I mean

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.840 
this is pretty much it this book I mean
overall<00:04:37.640> it's<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.000> really<00:04:38.500> nice<00:04:39.500> plot<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:40.280> mean

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
overall it's a really nice plot I mean

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.630 
overall it's a really nice plot I mean
there's<00:04:41.030> not<00:04:41.479> much<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:42.020> can<00:04:42.080> talk<00:04:42.470> about<00:04:42.710> apart
