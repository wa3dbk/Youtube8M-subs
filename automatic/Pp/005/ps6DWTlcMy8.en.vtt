 Hello dear children 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.630
 In this game, the animal species would have to click then mouse over the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.070
 Animal species and we get the right solution then the animal's goal disappears 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.120
 that we count all animals correctly 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.239

 and this game is evolving and you will see it coming to the next level 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.300
 There are twelve places and the number of animals is always increasing 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.370
 So more 12 wants it is more than 50 animals to arrange you 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.090
 Pander BÃ¤r eight points as I said the game is aimed at children 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.290
 So if you are little siblings or even children then you can test if you are 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.579
 players and that is they play once 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.489
 the game is free 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.930
 and the Finns as I said just break up TV 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.339
 and your own web page can also have these games with that 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.339
