 before starting today's episode yesterday 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.890
 although he did not see one of the most 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.680
 of the channel where he explained that 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.270
 possibly there will be a closing van 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.150
 to close this channel because I already have two 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.039
 strikes and there he explained that as I go to 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.529
 do when going to the main channel 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.509
 because if they close this channel or I have 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.880
 decided to close it because possibly already 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.370

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.890

 very very important now yes we are going to 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 start with today's episode 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 very good to all guys we are in the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.479
 third episode of reality role 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.909
 virtual on this occasion we are with this 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.500
 there is a motion sensor is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.330
 As soon as you enter, you should 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.460
 know but it's not for sale 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.120
 they can buy it on ebay from people from 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.430
 second hand but 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.810
 are on the official website of razer I think 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.520
 that they took away the market I do not know 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.500
 they stopped making but I do not know anymore 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.020
 I was to buy it by also I know 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.880
 so we're with this one there in this 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.700
 this system is a motion sensor 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.090
 commercial and dra exactly the same 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.890
 are watching as the panels and the two 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.000
 controllers controls 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.050
 this was created by the company systems and good 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.730
 right now I'm going to show you some 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.720
 examples 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.330
 just like the referee ref works with the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.120
 with the same with the same application 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.090
 it can work but they have a 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.070
 application there to know your own 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.830
 partner to run more perfect or 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.600
 be perfectly right now we have a 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.810
 final expression and such no but here we go 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.810
 to see the examples so we'll see each other 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.110
 Y 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.600
 day 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.510
 yes 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.860
 yes 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.270
 two 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.020
 Hello 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.480
 the truth that is pretty good this 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.820
 Ascents movements are mentally 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.230
 a recipe and cheaper 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.270
 let's see are the technical sheets 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.030
 when you go to the assistant page 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.730
 store can see that you can buy things 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.370
 not so then right now I'm 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.920
 putting the page and you know the prices 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.440
 the cheapest that normal bring if you 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.940
 like in videos 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.510
 worth $ 300 that brings the two 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.860
 controls and controlling it 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.790
 it will be cheaper the one that is worth 300 dollars 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.620
 and the others are more expensive but with more 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.510
 features like sensors 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.360
 also on top of that the hands on 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.490
 fingers to control you better in case 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.590
 you play games I know how to put on a 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.290
 ring do not do any stupidity like this 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.120
 and see how they can or less at the beginning 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.810
 this can work to create a game 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.520
 video is , if viewed video that 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.940
 is leaving by screen to give you 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.760
 a click or a description can see that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.140
 the Portuguese player with the razer and dry as 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.180
 there is no king is being waged right now in the 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.550
 market but then where do you add second 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.220
 hand we can use this you can not 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.530
 create a game like gong and online 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.790
 as I want to see on the screen with 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.850
 graphic emotion of johnny arrives and 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.120
 first we saw the video of the sword 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.100
 and then with a weapon that comes with the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.100
 that you can buy it separately with the gun 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:41.000
 external or so generic you can connect it 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.350
 to the video game and with the systems or the 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.070
 stent support systems exceptional 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.170
 estan systems and you can play something with 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.850
 who online or immersion the truth 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.770
 that can work well by the way 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.120
 it works when it with the kings almost 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.800
 everything works with the gray halo 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.020
 but it's for obviously to be the most 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.250
 Realistically I'm not going to make a vice of 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.660
 colors because she wants all the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.330
 the world knows it but I think I would do it for 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.490
 if I do not know if someone knows 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.020
 so nothing I hope faithful friends all 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.760
 today's chapter remember to leave a 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.470
 like and for the next episode and 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.750
 we must carry the 50 likes for 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:16.270
 get to the next episode so already 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.270
 know we are until the next bye
