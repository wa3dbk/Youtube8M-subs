00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
gorgeous piece of work as far as I know

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.910 
gorgeous piece of work as far as I know
this<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> first<00:01:12.270> example<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.290> forged

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this is the first example of a forged

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
this is the first example of a forged
trapper<00:01:14.549> style<00:01:15.000> knife<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.030> sure<00:01:18.210> he'll

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
trapper style knife and I'm sure he'll

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
trapper style knife and I'm sure he'll
make<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> contact<00:01:20.310> him<00:01:20.549> he'll

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
make more so if you contact him he'll

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.520 
make more so if you contact him he'll
probably<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> handle<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
probably make you one the handle on this

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
probably make you one the handle on this
has<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.450> tapered<00:01:24.450> tang<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:26.180> some<00:01:27.180> black

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
has a tapered tang and then some black

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.350 
has a tapered tang and then some black
looks<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.320> linen<00:01:28.740> micarta<00:01:29.250> scales<00:01:31.850> neat<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
looks like linen micarta scales neat you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.580 
looks like linen micarta scales neat you
should<00:01:33.540> check<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> out

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
should check it out

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
should check it out
one<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> reasons<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.520> show<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
one of the reasons I show you this is I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.109 
one of the reasons I show you this is I
just<00:01:37.290> realized<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.579> tracker

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
just realized that I'm a tracker

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
just realized that I'm a tracker
collector<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:40.020> rather<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.710> tracker<00:01:41.189> variant

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
collector or rather a tracker variant

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630 
collector or rather a tracker variant
collector<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> things<00:01:44.159> I've<00:01:44.340> said

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
collector so one of the things I've said

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450 
collector so one of the things I've said
on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> channel<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> elsewhere<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.159> long

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
on the channel and elsewhere for a long

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.389 
on the channel and elsewhere for a long
time<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.439> love<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:49.740> hate<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
time is that love it or hate it the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.969 
time is that love it or hate it the
tracker<00:01:51.180> style<00:01:51.930> design<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.720> very<00:01:54.979> unique

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
tracker style design is a very unique

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
tracker style design is a very unique
American<00:01:56.549> design<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> bowie<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
American design much like the bowie is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.069 
American design much like the bowie is
and<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:01.380> whether<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.829> use<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:03.079> or

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and you know whether you use them or or

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.100

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
not you kind of have to separate the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.210 
not you kind of have to separate the
usefulness<00:02:07.619> of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
usefulness of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.950

knife and the uses for the knife from
the<00:02:10.140> workmanship<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> artistry

the workmanship and the and the artistry
that<00:02:12.450> goes<00:02:12.600> into<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.550> like<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.820> for<00:02:15.120> example

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
that goes into it like this for example

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600 
that goes into it like this for example
the<00:02:16.380> cool<00:02:16.590> thing<00:02:16.800> about<00:02:16.830> these<00:02:17.220> tracker

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
the cool thing about these tracker

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.930 
the cool thing about these tracker
variants<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:19.580> there's<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.820> many

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
variants is that there's so many

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.200 
variants is that there's so many
different<00:02:21.330> things<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:23.760> kind<00:02:24.180> of

this is one that I put my preferred
grind<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:39.019> change<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.320> handle<00:03:40.739> to

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
grind on but then change the handle to

I<00:03:43.970> removed<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.150> second<00:03:45.750> bump<00:03:46.049> here<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:47.120> then

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
I removed the second bump here and then

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.270 
I removed the second bump here and then
put<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> palm<00:03:49.320> swell<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:52.500> know<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.920> made<00:03:53.160> it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
put a palm swell and you know it made it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.490 
put a palm swell and you know it made it
a<00:03:53.370> little<00:03:53.519> bit<00:03:53.700> more<00:03:53.910> robust<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.989> rounded<00:03:55.380> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
a little bit more robust and rounded the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.990 
a little bit more robust and rounded the
edges<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.860> little<00:03:56.130> bit<00:03:56.250> more<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.700> it's<00:03:56.820> more

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
edges a little bit more so it's more

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.680 
edges a little bit more so it's more
comfortable<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:57.600> use<00:03:58.160> as<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.400> can<00:03:59.580> see<00:03:59.880> well

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
comfortable for use as you can see well

comfortable for use as you can see well
maybe<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.049> cannot<00:04:01.470> show<00:04:01.739> close<00:04:02.010> up<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.940> one

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
maybe you cannot show close up this one

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.660 
maybe you cannot show close up this one
has<00:04:03.420> gotten<00:04:03.840> some<00:04:04.170> heavy<00:04:04.470> heavy<00:04:04.920> heavy<00:04:05.040> use

has gotten some heavy heavy heavy use

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.789 
has gotten some heavy heavy heavy use
and<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.470> it

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799

here's<00:04:08.519> another<00:04:08.610> example<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.360> where<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.920> knife

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
here's another example of where a knife

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.000 
here's another example of where a knife
maker<00:04:11.280> kind<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.880> took<00:04:12.120> and

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
maker kind of took and

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.849 
maker kind of took and
took<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.550> original<00:04:15.540> tracker<00:04:16.169> design<00:04:16.620> and

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
took the original tracker design and

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.479 
took the original tracker design and
modified<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:18.510> one<00:04:19.230> was<00:04:19.440> done<00:04:19.680> by<00:04:20.010> Mike

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
modified it this one was done by Mike

modified it this one was done by Mike
Stewart<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.389> Barbara<00:04:21.900> knives<00:04:23.120> he<00:04:24.120> made<00:04:24.720> I

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
Stewart of Barbara knives he made I

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.400 
Stewart of Barbara knives he made I
think<00:04:26.130> he<00:04:26.250> sold<00:04:26.490> made<00:04:27.300> them<00:04:27.480> sold<00:04:27.780> 20<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.290> these

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
think he sold made them sold 20 of these

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.050 
think he sold made them sold 20 of these
and<00:04:28.770> then<00:04:28.889> there<00:04:29.070> were<00:04:29.160> four<00:04:29.490> made<00:04:29.790> at<00:04:29.940> the

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
and then there were four made at the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.510 
and then there were four made at the
grind<00:04:30.330> in<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.740> one<00:04:31.889> that<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.100> made<00:04:32.340> it

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
grind in this is the one that I made it

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.570 
grind in this is the one that I made it
the<00:04:32.639> grindin<00:04:33.979> it's<00:04:34.979> different<00:04:35.370> than<00:04:35.550> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the grindin it's different than the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.450 
the grindin it's different than the
stock<00:04:35.910> ones<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.930> took<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.500> little

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
stock ones in that I took the little

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.350 
stock ones in that I took the little
hump<00:04:38.760> out<00:04:38.970> here<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.070> know<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.120> little

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
hump out here so you know just a little

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.940 
hump out here so you know just a little
bit<00:04:42.479> different<00:04:42.840> different<00:04:43.380> take<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
bit different different take on the

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.850 
bit different different take on the
whole<00:04:44.100> design<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.180> then<00:04:45.300> finally<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.650> is

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
whole design and then finally this is

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.159 
whole design and then finally this is
just<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.430> gargantuan<00:04:48.090> version<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.020> the

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
just the gargantuan version of the

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.240 
just the gargantuan version of the
tracker<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:50.310> is<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.580> m18<00:04:51.389> made<00:04:51.960> by<00:04:52.200> TM<00:04:52.889> hunt

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
tracker this is the m18 made by TM hunt

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.409 
tracker this is the m18 made by TM hunt
I<00:04:54.229> held<00:04:55.229> this<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.710> bought<00:04:55.979> it<00:04:56.100> immediately
