00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.670
 we accelerate decisively from there until we reach a long beach of 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 right we enter the fernando rise very strong for a right curve 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.780
 very closed that is a good place to overtake 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.960
 where it is important to get a good exit speed 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.370
 we enter a fast curve of the left and immediately a right that is very 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 hard for the car because it's incredibly fast 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.380
 still passing the wings of rights that were made a little the vertex

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.450
 through a brief with a very fast left and then a combination 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.060
 complicated in nothing and entering the penultimate turn curve 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.340

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 of the circuit with a fantastic grandstand on the left side before 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.120
