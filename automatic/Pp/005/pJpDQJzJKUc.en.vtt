00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
wrap to get all the steaming to loosen

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.759 
wrap to get all the steaming to loosen
up<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.730> end<00:03:44.879> but<00:03:45.420> as<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.810> tell<00:03:45.870> this

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
up the end but as you can tell this

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.160 
up the end but as you can tell this
outer<00:03:47.069> covering<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.879> peppers<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.629> really

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
outer covering of the peppers is really

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.229 
outer covering of the peppers is really
easy<00:03:49.439> to<00:03:49.680> take<00:03:49.799> off<00:03:50.010> at<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.430> point<00:03:50.730> so

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
easy to take off at this point so

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.089 
easy to take off at this point so
basically<00:03:52.170> all<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.709> peel<00:03:52.920> off<00:03:53.069> the

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
basically all you do is peel off the

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:00.379 
basically all you do is peel off the
outer<00:03:53.310> portion<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.260> pepper<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.389> I

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
outer portion of of the pepper and I

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.899 
outer portion of of the pepper and I
believe<00:04:00.780> that's<00:04:01.019> about<00:04:01.379> it<00:04:01.579> see<00:04:02.579> how<00:04:02.670> easy

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
believe that's about it see how easy

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.440 
believe that's about it see how easy
that<00:04:03.030> was<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:04.250> then<00:04:05.250> what<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.609> do<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.970> take<00:04:06.420> my

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
that was and then what I do is take my

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.830 
that was and then what I do is take my
fork<00:04:07.489> split<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.609> open<00:04:08.730> at<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> top<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:09.599> can

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
fork split it open at the top so I can

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.229 
fork split it open at the top so I can
get<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.139> seeds<00:04:10.379> out<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.670> end<00:04:11.879> because

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
get the seeds out and the end because

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:20.180 
get the seeds out and the end because
the<00:04:12.480> end<00:04:12.599> is<00:04:12.780> not<00:04:12.989> good<00:04:13.290> eat<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:19.709> go<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:19.949> drag

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
the end is not good eat just go and drag

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.659 
the end is not good eat just go and drag
it<00:04:20.370> out<00:04:20.519> all<00:04:20.970> right<00:04:21.710> at<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.979> point<00:04:23.070> becomes

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
it out all right at this point becomes

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.390 
it out all right at this point becomes
an<00:04:23.880> assembly<00:04:24.330> line<00:04:24.360> process<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.979> I<00:04:26.010> take<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
an assembly line process so I take the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.339 
an assembly line process so I take the
meat<00:04:26.729> neck<00:04:26.910> shirt<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.599> had<00:04:27.960> cooked<00:04:28.199> up

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
meat neck shirt that I had cooked up

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:37.730 
meat neck shirt that I had cooked up
before<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:30.720> stuck<00:04:31.050> with<00:04:36.440> stuff<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.590> into

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
before and I stuck with stuff it into

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.000 
before and I stuck with stuff it into
the<00:04:37.919> meat<00:04:38.039> mixture<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.699> then<00:04:39.680> continue<00:04:40.680> on<00:04:40.830> to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
the meat mixture and then continue on to

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:52.820 
the meat mixture and then continue on to
the<00:04:41.099> next<00:04:41.280> one<00:04:47.930> keep

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.760 

following<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.760> process<00:04:54.240> until<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.960> finish

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
following the process until you finish

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:14.450 
following the process until you finish
and<00:04:55.980> wrap<00:04:56.280> all<00:04:57.180> them

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.710 

if<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.580> have<00:05:15.760> any<00:05:15.970> additional<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.600> can

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
always just put it on top and then you

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.640 
always just put it on top and then you
can<00:05:20.830> sprinkle<00:05:21.360> 1<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.540> 2<00:05:22.690> ounces<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.230> cheese<00:05:23.380> on

top just to cover it up all right so at

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.830 
top just to cover it up all right so at
this<00:05:30.340> point<00:05:30.790> we're<00:05:31.300> going<00:05:31.420> to<00:05:31.480> put<00:05:31.630> in<00:05:31.750> the
