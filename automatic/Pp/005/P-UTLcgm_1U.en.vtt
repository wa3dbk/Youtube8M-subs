have<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.940> low<00:00:33.210> needs<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.260> you're

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
have really low needs it if you're

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
have really low needs it if you're
eating<00:00:34.739> organic<00:00:34.890> food<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.140> your

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
eating organic food it's it's on your

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
eating organic food it's it's on your
food<00:00:37.700> you<00:00:38.700> absorb<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> under<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.690> tongue

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
food you absorb it under your tongue

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
food you absorb it under your tongue
when<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> bite<00:00:40.620> into<00:00:40.829> lettuce<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.850> know

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
when you bite into lettuce and you know

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
when you bite into lettuce and you know
the<00:00:42.180> dirt<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> top<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.230> apple

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the dirt that's on the top of an apple

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
the dirt that's on the top of an apple
by<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> stem<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> mean<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.640> rich<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.090> b12

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
by the stem I mean that's rich in b12

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.799 
by the stem I mean that's rich in b12
right<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:47.610> our<00:00:47.730> needs<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.149> incredibly

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
right there but our needs are incredibly

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.860 
right there but our needs are incredibly
low<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.190> literally<00:00:50.870> redundant

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
low so so it's literally redundant

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
low so so it's literally redundant
production<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> problem<00:00:53.280> being<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
production the problem being that the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.950 
production the problem being that the
b12<00:00:55.199> micro<00:00:55.590> organism<00:00:56.210> in<00:00:57.210> our<00:00:57.390> intestines

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
b12 micro organism in our intestines

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.560 
b12 micro organism in our intestines
certainly<00:00:58.440> thrives<00:00:59.160> on<00:01:00.050> sugars<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
certainly thrives on sugars and so so

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.179 
certainly thrives on sugars and so so
although<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.989> colonies<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.739> mouth<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
although the colonies in our mouth of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
although the colonies in our mouth of
nose<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.460> throat<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.119> stuff<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.600> relatively

nose and throat and stuff are relatively
small<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> our<00:01:07.650> intestines<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> cities

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
small in our intestines we have cities

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.469 
small in our intestines we have cities
of<00:01:09.630> b12<00:01:10.229> microbes<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.460> thrive<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.820> sugar

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of b12 microbes that thrive on sugar

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
of b12 microbes that thrive on sugar
when<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.530> go<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> low<00:01:14.010> sugar<00:01:14.340> diet<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:15.630> have

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
when we go on a low sugar diet we have

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
when we go on a low sugar diet we have
smaller<00:01:16.110> colonies<00:01:16.710> producing<00:01:17.460> less<00:01:17.850> b12

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
smaller colonies producing less b12

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
smaller colonies producing less b12
because<00:01:18.630> b12<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.290> basically<00:01:19.680> part<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> their

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
because b12 is basically part of their

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.080 
because b12 is basically part of their
excrement<00:01:21.740> at<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> same<00:01:23.159> time<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> uptake

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
excrement at the same time the uptake

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
excrement at the same time the uptake
sites<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.720> b12<00:01:24.990> become<00:01:25.680> blocked<00:01:26.159> by<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> high

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
sites for b12 become blocked by the high

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960 
sites for b12 become blocked by the high
fat<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.140> low<00:01:28.320> carb<00:01:28.650> diets<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
fat in the low carb diets and so you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.940 
fat in the low carb diets and so you
produce<00:01:30.210> less<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.049> absorb<00:01:31.320> even<00:01:31.560> less

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.100 

being<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:35.820> stressing<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> body

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
being that you are stressing the body

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
being that you are stressing the body
and<00:01:37.759> then<00:01:38.780> consuming<00:01:39.780> even<00:01:40.110> less<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.369> stress

quadruple whammy at that point certainly
my<00:01:51.570> experience<00:01:52.320> has<00:01:52.590> been<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.890> most<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.759> the

my experience has been that most of the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.209 
my experience has been that most of the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
b12 most of the b12 symptoms that people

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.249 
b12 most of the b12 symptoms that people
show<00:01:59.520> our<00:02:00.380> remedy<00:02:01.759> by<00:02:02.759> removing<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> cause<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
show our remedy by removing the cause of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.910 
show our remedy by removing the cause of
the<00:02:04.829> problem

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
the problem

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.040 
the problem
which<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.430> typically<00:02:08.850> inhibited<00:02:10.050> inhibited

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
which is typically inhibited inhibited

which is typically inhibited inhibited
absorption<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:13.270> clinically<00:02:14.230> we've

absorption and so clinically we've

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.309 
absorption and so clinically we've
tested<00:02:14.880> hundreds<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:16.030> people<00:02:16.390> who<00:02:16.990> have<00:02:17.110> come

tested hundreds of people who have come

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.260

or three week fast and retest them for
b12<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.570> they<00:02:25.630> test<00:02:25.900> normal<00:02:26.520> where<00:02:27.520> they<00:02:27.640> had

b12 and they test normal where they had

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.620 
b12 and they test normal where they had
no<00:02:28.090> intake<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.780> b12<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.970> what<00:02:31.480> was

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
no intake of b12 and so what was

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.020 
no intake of b12 and so what was
actually<00:02:31.810> done<00:02:32.170> was<00:02:32.410> removal<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> stress

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
actually done was removal of the stress

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.690 
actually done was removal of the stress
and<00:02:34.680> removal<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.100> reduced<00:02:37.110> absorption<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and removal of the reduced absorption so

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.720 
and removal of the reduced absorption so
I<00:02:40.000> won't<00:02:40.750> say<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.230> not<00:02:41.350> an<00:02:41.530> issue<00:02:41.680> we<00:02:42.340> we
