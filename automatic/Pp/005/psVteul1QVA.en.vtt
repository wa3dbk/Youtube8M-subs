hi everyone Rick Malaya here with a with
another<00:00:06.029> question<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.810> seems<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.230> my

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
another question this seems to be my

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.589 
another question this seems to be my
week<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.740> four<00:00:08.400> questions<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> forum<00:00:09.389> and

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
week for four questions in the forum and

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.839 
week for four questions in the forum and
at<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.840> time<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.380> Mayas<00:00:11.130> units<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
at this time it's about Mayas units and

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.340 
at this time it's about Mayas units and
the<00:00:12.719> measuring<00:00:13.049> tool<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:14.269> I'm<00:00:15.289> working<00:00:16.289> on

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the measuring tool I I'm working on

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
the measuring tool I I'm working on
project<00:00:16.859> I'm<00:00:16.980> trying<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.279> scale<00:00:17.520> things<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
project I'm trying to scale things up to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
project I'm trying to scale things up to
normal<00:00:18.330> size<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.570> I'm<00:00:19.109> using<00:00:19.289> some<00:00:19.439> locators

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
normal size and I'm using some locators

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
normal size and I'm using some locators
and<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.850> objects<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> know<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and some objects that I know what the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.790 
and some objects that I know what the
sizes<00:00:22.230> are<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.269> the<00:00:24.269> idea<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.619> some

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
sizes are and the idea is I put some

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.990 
sizes are and the idea is I put some
locators<00:00:26.480> around<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:28.609> distance<00:00:29.609> measuring

locators on the object that I want to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
locators on the object that I want to
scale<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.270> proper<00:00:33.630> size<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:35.010> some<00:00:35.370> part<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
scale to proper size on some part of the

just the age so I got this pilot sitting
down<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.079> can't<00:00:43.379> figure<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.989> don't

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
down and I can't figure out what I don't

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
down and I can't figure out what I don't
know<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> average<00:00:47.399> height<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
know what the average height from a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.240 
know what the average height from a

seated person is but I know what the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
average height of a head is so I created

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
average height of a head is so I created
a<00:00:52.920> distance<00:00:53.309> tool<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> top<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> his<00:00:54.420> head

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to the bottom of his chin and I'll just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.279 
to the bottom of his chin and I'll just
keep<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.829> I'll<00:00:59.100> show<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.550> other

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
grid line every 12 unit so there's a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.640

black grid line every 12 inches which is
one<00:01:26.070> foot<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.479> six<00:01:27.810> subdivisions<00:01:28.680> so

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
one foot and I have six subdivisions so

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.789 
one foot and I have six subdivisions so
there's<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> there's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> dark<00:01:29.850> gray<00:01:30.119> line

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
there's a there's a dark gray line

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
there's a there's a dark gray line
there's<00:01:31.799> every<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.430> inches<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.479> i<00:01:33.689> zoom

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
there's every two inches so if i zoom

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.950 
there's every two inches so if i zoom
out<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:34.890> boxes<00:01:35.430> should<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:36.030> 12

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
out here one of these boxes should be 12

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.679 
out here one of these boxes should be 12
inches<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.680> each<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.490> these<00:01:38.689> subdivisions

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
inches and each of these subdivisions

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.370 
inches and each of these subdivisions
should<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.049> 2x2<00:01:40.590> squares<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> here's<00:01:43.170> where

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
should be 2x2 squares so here's where

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.450 
should be 2x2 squares so here's where
I'm<00:01:43.470> losing<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:43.979> mind

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I'm losing my mind

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
I'm losing my mind
it's<00:01:45.000> telling<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.079> distance<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.680> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
8 10 12 and a little over an inch here

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.859 
8 10 12 and a little over an inch here
and<00:02:01.649> I'll<00:02:02.070> almost<00:02:02.579> an<00:02:02.969> inch<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.689> we're

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
and I'll almost an inch here so we're

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.800 
and I'll almost an inch here so we're
looking<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.619> 14<00:02:05.189> inches<00:02:05.659> for<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
looking at you know 14 inches for this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.539 
looking at you know 14 inches for this
head<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.079> now<00:02:07.500> um

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.240 

but<00:02:11.549> it's<00:02:11.670> telling<00:02:11.879> me<00:02:12.030> 5.5<00:02:12.840> -<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.290> don't<00:02:14.129> know

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
but it's telling me 5.5 - I don't know

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.530 
but it's telling me 5.5 - I don't know
what<00:02:14.400> where<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.730> getting<00:02:14.970> those<00:02:15.090> units<00:02:15.390> from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
what where it's getting those units from

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.830 
what where it's getting those units from
so<00:02:16.379> then<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> just<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.400> another<00:02:18.090> example<00:02:18.239> I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
so then as a just a another example I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.229 
so then as a just a another example I
know<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.830> foot<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.760> 12

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
know this is one foot it's it's 12

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.850 
know this is one foot it's it's 12
inches<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.959> six<00:02:22.440> subdivisions<00:02:23.299> so<00:02:24.470> if<00:02:25.470> I

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
inches with six subdivisions so if I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.080 
inches with six subdivisions so if I
come<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:28.879> create<00:02:29.879> another

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
come in here and I create another

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.149 
come in here and I create another
distance<00:02:30.569> tool<00:02:33.650> create<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> measuring<00:02:34.980> tool

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
distance tool create a measuring tool

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.610 
distance tool create a measuring tool
distance<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:36.390> snap<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.989> grid<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> go

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
distance and I snap to grid and I go

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.399 
distance and I snap to grid and I go
from<00:02:37.829> here<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.879> here<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.390> should<00:02:39.989> be<00:02:40.140> 12

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
from here to here that should be 12

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.740 
from here to here that should be 12
inches<00:02:40.829> but<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.819> coming<00:02:42.150> up<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:42.420> four

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
inches but it's coming up with four

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.550 
inches but it's coming up with four
