executable installer you can run most of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.260 
executable installer you can run most of
them<00:00:32.040> however<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.730> come<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> zip

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
them however do not they come as a zip

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.850 
them however do not they come as a zip
file<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.510> unzip<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> bunch<00:00:34.680> of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
file you unzip it and you get a bunch of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
file you unzip it and you get a bunch of
files<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.750> there's<00:00:37.050> some

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
files like this so in here there's some

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.500 
files like this so in here there's some
directories<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.790> explain<00:00:39.180> nine

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
directories which are for explain nine

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
directories which are for explain nine
and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.620> overwrite<00:00:41.129> those

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and then you can overwrite those

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
and then you can overwrite those
directories<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.000> what's<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.690> for

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
directories with what's in here for

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.299 
directories with what's in here for
explain<00:00:43.410> ten<00:00:43.620> obviously<00:00:44.010> I'm<00:00:44.100> running

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
explain ten obviously I'm running

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.569 
explain ten obviously I'm running
explain<00:00:44.640> ten<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.829> my<00:00:46.829> task<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.370> fairly

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
explain ten so my task is fairly

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.590 
explain ten so my task is fairly
straightforward<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.239> think

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
straightforward I think

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
straightforward I think
copy<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> x-plane<00:00:49.559> nine<00:00:49.770> files<00:00:50.039> over<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
copy the x-plane nine files over and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.799 
copy the x-plane nine files over and
then<00:00:50.910> replace<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
then replace some of them will you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.630 
then replace some of them will you
explain<00:00:52.050> ten<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.800> explained<00:00:53.340> stored

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
explain ten now I have explained stored

there simple now I have to copy some

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
there simple now I have to copy some
extra<00:01:30.960> files<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.619> running<00:01:31.770> explain

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
extra files because I'm running explain

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
extra files because I'm running explain
ten<00:01:32.460> some<00:01:32.970> aircraft<00:01:33.270> come<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.470> explain

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
ten some aircraft come just for explain

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.160 
ten some aircraft come just for explain
ten<00:01:34.979> somewhere<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.909> they<00:01:36.000> have

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
ten somewhere like this and they have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.880 
ten somewhere like this and they have
changes<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> need<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.740> into

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
changes that you need to take into

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
changes that you need to take into
account<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.310> explain<00:01:38.700> ten<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.840> we're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
account for explain ten so what we're

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
do you want to merge this folder let's

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
do you want to merge this folder let's
see<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.020> current<00:01:49.170> items<00:01:49.560> yes<00:01:49.979> I

see do this for all current items yes I
do<00:01:50.240> okay<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:51.899> similar

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
do okay now there's some similar

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
do okay now there's some similar
similarly<00:01:53.340> named<00:01:53.640> files<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.390> which<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
similarly named files in here which is

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.870 
similarly named files in here which is
correct<00:01:54.960> we're<00:01:55.140> replacing<00:01:55.380> these<00:01:55.950> ones<00:01:56.280> with

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
correct we're replacing these ones with

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
correct we're replacing these ones with
these<00:01:57.119> ones<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.689> say<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
these ones so we say do this for the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.459 
these ones so we say do this for the
next<00:01:58.560> seven<00:01:58.950> conflicts<00:01:59.369> copy<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.299> replace

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
next seven conflicts copy and replace

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
next seven conflicts copy and replace
done<00:02:01.469> all<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.579> remains<00:02:02.969> at<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.329> point<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
done all that remains at this point is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.780 
done all that remains at this point is
to<00:02:03.810> fire<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.380> explain<00:02:04.740> itself<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to fire up explain itself and see if the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.850 
to fire up explain itself and see if the
aircraft<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.930> I'm<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> do

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
aircraft is there so I'm going to do

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.650 
aircraft is there so I'm going to do
that<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.700> far<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:09.060> explain<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that right now as far up explain there

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510 
that right now as far up explain there
it<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> run<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> 64-bit<00:02:11.280> version

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it is it's going to run a 64-bit version

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.540 
it is it's going to run a 64-bit version
takes<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.120> little<00:02:13.240> while<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.630> load<00:02:13.660> up<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.430> we

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
version I don't think there is a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.670 
version I don't think there is a
difference<00:03:07.750> because<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:08.080> copied<00:03:08.350> those<00:03:08.470> files

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
difference because we copied those files

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
aircraft appears to have loaded we'll

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.750 
aircraft appears to have loaded we'll

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
just check it out put it into the 3d

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760 
just check it out put it into the 3d
cockpit<00:03:42.420> view<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:42.960> set<00:03:43.200> track<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.560> huh

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770
