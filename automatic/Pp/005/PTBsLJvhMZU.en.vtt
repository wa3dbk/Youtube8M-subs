00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.660 

bully<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.420> take<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> xbox<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> bar<00:00:28.859> out

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bully so take the xbox with the bar out

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.139 
bully so take the xbox with the bar out
the<00:00:29.849> case<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.330> simple<00:00:30.980> okay<00:00:31.980> I've<00:00:32.910> just

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the case very simple okay I've just

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.830 
the case very simple okay I've just
taken<00:00:33.360> me<00:00:33.719> GPU<00:00:34.530> heatsink<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.840> first

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
taken me GPU heatsink up there and first

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.940 
taken me GPU heatsink up there and first
first<00:00:37.230> thing<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
first thing we do is you look down the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.380 
first thing we do is you look down the
pins<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.719> solder<00:00:42.719> 12<00:00:43.469> volt<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> fat<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
pins you solder 12 volt to the fat to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.170 
pins you solder 12 volt to the fat to
enable<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> fans<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.340> run<00:00:47.460> faster<00:00:47.910> hence

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
enable the fans are run faster hence

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.049 
enable the fans are run faster hence
making<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.020> xbox<00:00:49.530> run<00:00:49.710> cooler<00:00:49.969> it's<00:00:50.969> not

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
making the xbox run cooler it's not

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.119 
making the xbox run cooler it's not
right<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:52.020> many<00:00:52.410> people<00:00:52.649> don't<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:55.430> is

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
right now what many people don't know is

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.439 
right now what many people don't know is
the<00:00:59.129> xbox<00:00:59.570> relies<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> 12<00:01:01.410> volt<00:01:01.559> amp

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
the xbox relies on a 12 volt amp

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.560 
the xbox relies on a 12 volt amp
resistor<00:01:03.830> failure<00:01:04.830> system<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.240> if

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
resistor failure system now right if

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.380 
resistor failure system now right if
band<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:08.220> turns<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.740> EM<00:01:10.760> fuses<00:01:11.760> three<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
band it turns out for EM fuses three of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
band it turns out for EM fuses three of
the<00:01:12.479> capacitors<00:01:13.049> those<00:01:13.590> three<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> these

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the capacitors those three of these

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.920 
the capacitors those three of these
three<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.590> it's<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
three here it's all right there and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.920 
three here it's all right there and
basically<00:01:19.009> yet<00:01:20.009> simple<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:24.540> them<00:01:24.750> out

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
basically yet simple just with them out

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
basically yet simple just with them out
you<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.670> they're<00:01:26.850> actually<00:01:27.270> needed

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you think that they're actually needed

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:39.160 
you think that they're actually needed
button<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.439> okay<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:30.000> one

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.610 

that's<00:01:40.170> three<00:01:40.590> ok<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.410> piece<00:01:43.410> that

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
that's three ok so this piece that

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.230 
that's three ok so this piece that
sticking<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.760> need<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.060> make<00:01:45.180> sure

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
sticking out you need to make sure

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.260 
sticking out you need to make sure
that's<00:01:45.540> touching<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.980> other<00:01:47.160> one<00:01:47.370> you<00:01:47.970> can

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's touching the other one you can

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.530 
that's touching the other one you can
sold<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.620> to<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:51.180> next

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
sold it up you don't have to the next

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.720 
sold it up you don't have to the next
thing<00:01:51.630> you're<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:51.990> need<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
thing you're going to need to do and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.590 
thing you're going to need to do and
you're<00:01:53.730> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.090> believe<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you're going to not believe we want to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.710 
you're going to not believe we want to
do<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.900> but<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.230> is<00:01:55.260> absolutely<00:01:56.010> crucial<00:01:56.720> is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
do this but it is absolutely crucial is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.360 
do this but it is absolutely crucial is
we<00:01:58.080> need<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> remove<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.650> GPU<00:01:59.780> again<00:02:01.130> now<00:02:02.130> most

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
we need to remove the GPU again now most

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.940 
we need to remove the GPU again now most
people<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:03.090> overheat<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.870> GPU<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.650> take<00:02:04.830> it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
people would overheat the GPU to take it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.270 
people would overheat the GPU to take it
away<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.910> easiest<00:02:06.480> way<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.900> doing<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.280> it's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
away the easiest way of doing this it's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.090 
away the easiest way of doing this it's
really<00:02:08.610> simple<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.440> get<00:02:10.440> screwed<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.070> over

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
really simple to get screwed you over

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.410 
really simple to get screwed you over
like<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.170> that's<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.430> you'll

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
like so that's it see that and you'll

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.440 
like so that's it see that and you'll
see<00:02:15.630> all<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> little<00:02:16.670> solder<00:02:17.670> points<00:02:18.030> there

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
see all the little solder points there

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.090 
see all the little solder points there
and<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:21.870> attorney<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.260> advise<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.710> rent<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
33.3 mle see how I use the ruler there

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.970 
33.3 mle see how I use the ruler there
to<00:02:50.580> take<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> off<00:02:51.530> stick<00:02:52.530> no<00:02:52.680> that's<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.840> ok<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
to take it off stick no that's up ok the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.280 
to take it off stick no that's up ok the
next<00:02:56.010> thing<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.489> need<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.420> remove<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
next thing we need to do is remove the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.850 
next thing we need to do is remove the
SATA<00:02:58.770> port<00:02:59.220> again<00:02:59.610> that's<00:02:59.850> no<00:03:00.090> longer<00:03:00.239> needed

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
SATA port again that's no longer needed

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
you about obviously rewiring the fan

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.370 
you about obviously rewiring the fan
that's<00:03:52.120> obviously<00:03:52.960> very<00:03:53.020> crucial<00:03:55.380> another

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
that's obviously very crucial another

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.900 
that's obviously very crucial another
thing<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.830> you<00:03:56.860> need<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.100> do<00:03:57.340> before<00:03:57.520> we<00:03:57.760> put

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
thing that you need to do before we put

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.600 
thing that you need to do before we put
this<00:03:58.000> bad<00:03:58.210> boy<00:03:58.330> about<00:03:58.570> together<00:03:58.930> again<00:03:59.260> oh

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
this bad boy about together again oh

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.330 
this bad boy about together again oh
yeah<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.670> don't<00:04:00.760> need<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.270> pitch<00:04:01.540> sinker

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.610 

but<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:07.390> easiest<00:04:07.570> way<00:04:07.900> rather<00:04:08.170> than<00:04:08.230> ever<00:04:08.440> to

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
but the easiest way rather than ever to

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.880 
but the easiest way rather than ever to
do<00:04:08.710> all<00:04:08.830> this<00:04:09.010> easiest<00:04:09.760> way<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.240> this

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
do all this easiest way to do this

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.729 
do all this easiest way to do this
probably<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.010> our<00:04:12.720> family<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.870> try<00:04:17.680> and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
probably in our family to just try and

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.580 
probably in our family to just try and
break<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:18.190> boy<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:19.020> that<00:04:20.020> makes<00:04:20.290> it<00:04:20.440> more

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
break the boy and that makes it more

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.270 
break the boy and that makes it more
compact<00:04:21.120> much<00:04:22.120> more<00:04:22.450> compact<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.170> in<00:04:23.890> theory

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
compact much more compact and in theory

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.660 
compact much more compact and in theory
you've<00:04:24.580> now<00:04:24.760> got<00:04:24.820> two<00:04:25.150> xboxes<00:04:26.010> right<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:27.430> let's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
you've now got two xboxes right so let's

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.890 
you've now got two xboxes right so let's
put<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:27.910> all<00:04:28.000> back<00:04:28.090> together<00:04:28.270> again<00:04:28.480> see<00:04:28.840> a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
put it all back together again see a

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.550 
put it all back together again see a
good<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:32.910> funnel<00:04:33.910> things<00:04:34.180> in<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.480> xbox<00:04:34.720> very

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
good just funnel things in the xbox very

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.980 
good just funnel things in the xbox very
important<00:04:35.980> screwdriver<00:04:36.490> make<00:04:37.420> sure<00:04:37.450> all<00:04:37.660> the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
important screwdriver make sure all the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.020 
important screwdriver make sure all the
poles<00:04:38.260> are<00:04:38.620> currently<00:04:39.160> screwed<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.700> properly

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
poles are currently screwed in properly

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.260 
poles are currently screwed in properly
okay<00:04:43.030> that's<00:04:43.510> fine<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.800> as<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.190> we<00:04:45.880> just<00:04:46.090> left

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
okay that's fine so as you we just left

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.230 
okay that's fine so as you we just left
you<00:04:46.510> before<00:04:47.460> basically<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:48.610> we<00:04:48.730> did<00:04:48.910> just<00:04:48.970> to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
you before basically what we did just to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.590 
you before basically what we did just to
recap<00:04:49.630> remove<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.620> three<00:04:50.860> capacitors<00:04:51.600> remove

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
recap remove the three capacitors remove

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.760 
recap remove the three capacitors remove
processor<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:54.240> also<00:04:55.380> one<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.560> latest

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
processor and also one of the latest

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.860 
processor and also one of the latest
hacks<00:04:57.130> you'll<00:04:57.340> find<00:04:57.640> that<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.300> if<00:04:58.480> you<00:04:58.600> look<00:04:58.720> on

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
hacks you'll find that so if you look on

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.980 
hacks you'll find that so if you look on
the<00:04:58.960> internet<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.380> Google<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.750> Xbox<00:05:01.750> mother

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
the internet and Google and Xbox mother

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.600 
the internet and Google and Xbox mother
board<00:05:02.230> in<00:05:02.380> half<00:05:02.410> you'll<00:05:02.830> find<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.370> can

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
board in half you'll find that you can

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.690 
board in half you'll find that you can
actually<00:05:03.760> gain<00:05:04.270> two<00:05:04.840> xboxes<00:05:05.560> Microsoft<00:05:06.460> don't

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
actually gain two xboxes Microsoft don't

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.070 
actually gain two xboxes Microsoft don't
want<00:05:06.910> you<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.090> know<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:07.360> but<00:05:07.600> we<00:05:07.750> found<00:05:07.930> this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
want you to know this but we found this

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.320 
want you to know this but we found this
out<00:05:08.320> but<00:05:08.710> I<00:05:08.770> simply<00:05:08.950> just<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.670> cutting<00:05:10.210> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
out but I simply just just cutting the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.190 
out but I simply just just cutting the
xbox<00:05:10.720> enough<00:05:10.990> two<00:05:11.710> methods<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:13.810> can<00:05:13.840> do<00:05:14.050> by

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
xbox enough two methods you can do by

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:30.980 
xbox enough two methods you can do by
your<00:05:14.350> own

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.100 

so<00:05:31.990> we're<00:05:32.979> done<00:05:33.129> we've<00:05:33.520> so<00:05:34.300> we've<00:05:34.449> in<00:05:34.749> theory

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
so we're done we've so we've in theory

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.989 
so we're done we've so we've in theory
got<00:05:35.259> another<00:05:35.469> xbox<00:05:35.919> I'm<00:05:36.099> not<00:05:36.430> bill<00:05:36.639> to<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:36.789> one

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:36.999 
got another xbox I'm not bill to the one

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.450 
got another xbox I'm not bill to the one
I've<00:05:37.150> only<00:05:37.300> got<00:05:37.479> one<00:05:37.509> case<00:05:37.900> so<00:05:38.409> just<00:05:39.039> finishing

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
I've only got one case so just finishing

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.549 
I've only got one case so just finishing
this<00:05:39.550> off<00:05:39.729> now<00:05:41.819> okay<00:05:42.819> and<00:05:43.059> hard<00:05:43.749> drive<00:05:44.020> that's

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:44.559 
this off now okay and hard drive that's

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:47.029 
this off now okay and hard drive that's
the<00:05:44.740> one<00:05:44.919> trillion<00:05:45.370> by<00:05:45.520> hard<00:05:45.789> drive<00:05:46.029> in<00:05:46.449> on

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
the one trillion by hard drive in on
