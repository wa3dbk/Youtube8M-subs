00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
oxygen that is found in plants under

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.960 
oxygen that is found in plants under
water<00:02:01.140> into<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.069> air<00:02:02.280> bubble<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.789> they

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
water into that air bubble so they

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.820 
water into that air bubble so they
really<00:02:03.450> don't<00:02:03.660> even<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.170> ever<00:02:04.349> come<00:02:04.649> up
