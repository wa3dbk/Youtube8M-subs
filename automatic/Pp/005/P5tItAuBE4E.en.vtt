00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.580 
pretty easily just a small shelving unit
up<00:01:16.080> top<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.680> my<00:01:16.950> M<00:01:17.479> iPhone<00:01:18.479> speaker<00:01:18.960> it's

table over here with some clay storage
underneath<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.070> use<00:01:30.030> plain<00:01:30.659> wood<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.920> my

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
underneath I use plain wood for my

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.920 
underneath I use plain wood for my
wedging<00:01:32.460> surface<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> lot<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> people

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
wedging surface I know a lot of people

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
wedging surface I know a lot of people
use<00:01:34.170> canvas<00:01:34.799> I've<00:01:35.070> had<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.549> no<00:01:35.790> problem<00:01:36.210> using

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
use canvas I've had it no problem using

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.100 
use canvas I've had it no problem using
plain<00:01:36.810> wood<00:01:37.310> when<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> took<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.610> workshop<00:01:39.110> with

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
plain wood when I took a workshop with

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.429 
plain wood when I took a workshop with
Simon<00:01:40.740> leach<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.250> Spain<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:42.689> used<00:01:42.899> an<00:01:43.049> old<00:01:43.170> wood

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
Simon leach in Spain he used an old wood

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
Simon leach in Spain he used an old wood
form<00:01:43.799> table<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.579> his<00:01:44.790> father<00:01:45.060> used<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.750> his

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
form table that his father used and his

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.800 
form table that his father used and his
grandfather<00:01:46.350> used<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> held<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.060> very

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
grandfather used and it held up very

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
grandfather used and it held up very
well<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.799> figured<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> might<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.790> well<00:01:50.909> go

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
well so I figured I might as well go

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
well so I figured I might as well go
with<00:01:51.090> wood<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.689> lot<00:01:51.840> easier<00:01:52.170> than

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
with wood it's a lot easier than

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.490 
with wood it's a lot easier than
covering<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.520> canvas<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.540> worrying<00:01:55.380> about

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
covering that canvas and worrying about

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.999 
covering that canvas and worrying about
that

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.219 

here<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.240> shelving<00:02:00.240> unit<00:02:00.299> again<00:02:00.869> with

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
here is a shelving unit again with

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
basically on that shelving unit as you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.440 
basically on that shelving unit as you
can<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.870> very<00:02:18.870> compact<00:02:19.379> area<00:02:19.739> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
can see this is a very compact area I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.850 
can see this is a very compact area I
kind<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.750> fit<00:02:22.049> everything<00:02:22.379> in<00:02:22.769> our
