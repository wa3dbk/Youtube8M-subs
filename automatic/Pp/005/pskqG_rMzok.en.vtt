00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.589
 here we are going to ask you questions there 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.030
 how they made the pyramids 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 seven in chorus an organic militia 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.179
 that is to say the concept allows one to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.770
 say voice do you have an example I 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.449
 will take the chickens draw and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 as an example today I mean of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.699
 to make the back in the trunk of the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
 draw pulleys for the back this is at 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.660
 say that you will increase in weight 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.740
 and by decreasing repetition within the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.530
 pyramid system 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.140
 for example I start here for example 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:43.790
 50 kg thomas I do my first is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.790
 the warm-up I make us repeat 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.540
 st understanding drink I want to believe 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.090
 well kept contraction that's my 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.890
 first series 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.840
 I do two repetitions series I enter 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.310
 in June still plays a little bit of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.770
 weight what they have the first series g 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.610
 proud i did to two in competition 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.400
 as an example a 2nd series I know that I 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.460
 I'm going to do that because that's the thing I've 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.750
 learned during my career I do not speak 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.280
 a lot of time it's the second 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.050
 third success in the tender the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
 petition so I keep 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.680
 I keep all my energy for 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.570
 the adversary 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.040
 but the concept of pyramids as I 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.800
 did you say al haboubi at the beginning of the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.710
 video you climb in charge and you 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.869
 decrease in repetition so for me on 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.020
 this concept 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:53.229
 here we will do the rehearsals with this 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.229
 weight 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.660
 gently in the contraction 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 that's how we train cash 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.360
 tore hockey 3rd series 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:16.450
 you add again 75 kg 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.950
 raised to 90 kg 9 95 pounds so the very 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.360
 important you stretch and dorsal well 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:32.290
 this is how we you interested 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:35.020
 dorsal and you do the series here I 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.910
 am going to do charles of course did 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.310
 know how to do repetition yes because I 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.090
 know that I still could our sky that 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.400
 will give to Caesar 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:52.480
 so I would like to keep my strength 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:55.410
 his picture or just position 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.410
 the benefits to older women 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:16.340
 keep the contraction at mas 95 kg ha 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.930
 well when I felt that's how 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.430
 I know the hope I felt that 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.209
 when I go up job to the ben 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.390
 ali 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.140
 I can not ride 20 rolling at 30 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.420
 kg I know that the best sixths 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.220
 repetition I started to really 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.109
 take a little contraction 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.940
 what am I going to do I'm going to 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.060
 rest even more between the 3rd and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.939
 4th well series and I want to add 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.680
 just ten pounds no more but I'm going 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.650
 to have under the sun is to have my 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.549
 son has handed positions now 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.709
 I added to it is about 100 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:59.209
 105 kg during rehearsals there I 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.810
 I'll have to slide to focus on 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:06.109
 on tight alain's analysis and that's where 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.970
 the most important series for your 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.970
 pyramid system very slowly 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.270
 petition 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.000
 that's how you do it 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.090
 system peer to peer friends hope 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.250
 you have well explain the concept zero 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:51.620
 but has noticed and fears to see 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.740
 the video several times regained Sunday 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.650
 the gart the attention the contraction the 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.360
 very young form not so video at all 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.380
 the world to regulate I hope I have 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.380
 resume your question
