 about fit on each table gun 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 12 gauge but we interfere with the connecting 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.140
 part of the mount in this in this part 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 will have to be cut under the bar part 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.010
 Mounting is done with a hacksaw 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 on metal 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.970

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.680
 my lantern is attached 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 so that this mount and in contact with 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.570
 the barrel so how can you scratch it 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.220
 I used just such a rubber band 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.320
 small can use gum from 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.959
 milk 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:35.440
 In principle it is fixed very quickly 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:38.760
 compact very durable and worth quite 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.799
 shelving here and for showcase 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.440
 That's how it turned out you have a nape 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.480
 lantern that is you can screw in here 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.540

 that's the way it is fixed 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 also this mount is very convenient my 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.480
 case i still bonded the gopro camera 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.220
 also very convenient to mount 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.820
 Initially there was a problem how to attach 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.820
 camera to your gun 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.130
 furniture leg all the furniture on here and 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.280
 everyone probably has a bend 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.540
 fixing and furniture legs 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.510
 made four holes drilled 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.860

 the camera fastened circled is also very 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.280
 quickly and in principle with the same mount 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.280
 I use 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.900
 lantern surprise 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.590
 So 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.400
 delay you can crush boldly words not 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.360
 damage and not the same time fixing u 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.070
 you will be pretty tough 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.670
 so it happened mount there 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.480
 the camera can be raised higher 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.340
 fix and same time fastened 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:54.210
 it is possible to take a simple look 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:56.910
 closer to consolidate each encountered 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.560
 probably the walls who use grenade launchers 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.740
 lanterns 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.560
 the mount flashlight from 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:09.260
 very often break in this came to me 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.970
 to the idea of ​​making yourself a mount and 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.450
 There was a variant from slow 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.450
 fastener 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.380
 this mount is made very 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.690
 fast very easy 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:27.570
 with the ability to work there hacksaw open 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:30.930
 two pieces of attachment and trim them 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.940
 process this file but will 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.100
