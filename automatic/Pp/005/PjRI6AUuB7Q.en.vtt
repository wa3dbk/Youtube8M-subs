okay so we're done does a really bad
gameplay<00:01:37.240> because<00:01:38.240> probably<00:01:38.390> couldn't<00:01:38.750> sit

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
gameplay because probably couldn't sit

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.420 
gameplay because probably couldn't sit
because<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.530> Tom<00:01:39.830> that's<00:01:40.010> it

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
because I Tom that's it

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.300 
because I Tom that's it
but<00:01:41.090> anyway<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.930> get<00:01:42.050> 500<00:01:42.560> XP<00:01:42.860> also<00:01:43.070> this

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
but anyway so you get 500 XP also this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.430 
but anyway so you get 500 XP also this
is<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.970> quest<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.390> very<00:01:44.600> good

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.810 

experience<00:01:48.440> if<00:01:48.650> you've<00:01:48.799> got<00:01:49.009> only<00:01:49.310> three

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
experience if you've got only three

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.270 
experience if you've got only three
stars<00:01:50.090> kind<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.450> low<00:01:50.720> level<00:01:50.750> three<00:01:51.259> stars<00:01:51.500> okay

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
stars kind of low level three stars okay

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.810 
stars kind of low level three stars okay
so<00:01:52.340> for<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:52.790> we<00:01:52.880> get<00:01:53.060> three<00:01:53.780> times<00:01:54.520> 125<00:01:55.520> s

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
so for that we get three times 125 s

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.810 
so for that we get three times 125 s
away<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:57.229> hopefully<00:01:57.710> we<00:01:57.830> don't<00:01:57.920> get<00:01:58.100> isolate

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
away so hopefully we don't get isolate

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.100 
away so hopefully we don't get isolate
right<00:01:59.000> now<00:01:59.119> because<00:01:59.270> sometimes<00:01:59.810> you<00:01:59.930> do

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
right now because sometimes you do

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.649 
right now because sometimes you do
actually<00:02:00.530> get<00:02:00.680> 125<00:02:01.580> s<00:02:01.759> away<00:02:01.940> instead<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.390> the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
actually get 125 s away instead of the

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.800 
actually get 125 s away instead of the
tier<00:02:03.380> 2<00:02:03.409> catalysts<00:02:04.360> I'm<00:02:05.360> going<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.570> open<00:02:05.630> that

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
tier 2 catalysts I'm going to open that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.080 
tier 2 catalysts I'm going to open that
oh<00:02:06.110> my<00:02:06.560> god<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.130> we<00:02:07.310> get<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.940> tier<00:02:08.600> 2<00:02:08.630> iso<00:02:09.320> 8<00:02:10.090> ok

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
oh my god and we get the tier 2 iso 8 ok

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.699 
oh my god and we get the tier 2 iso 8 ok
so<00:02:11.150> i'm<00:02:11.450> just<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.750> quickly<00:02:11.959> go<00:02:12.680> through

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
of tier 2 basic catalysts I need that

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.130 
of tier 2 basic catalysts I need that
for<00:02:24.920> upgrading<00:02:25.400> my<00:02:25.489> Gomorrah<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.780> if<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.019> go

for upgrading my Gomorrah so if I go
continue<00:02:28.150> don't<00:02:29.150> want<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.330> use<00:02:29.420> my<00:02:29.540> crystals

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
continue don't want to use my crystals

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.380 
continue don't want to use my crystals
yet<00:02:30.050> save<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.410> for<00:02:30.500> another<00:02:30.590> video<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.970> I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
yet save that for another video so I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.210 
yet save that for another video so I
will<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.260> telling<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.709> guys<00:02:33.890> which

quest I did so if you're going to quit

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.539 
quest I did so if you're going to quit
you'll<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.420> your<00:02:38.450> story<00:02:38.900> obviously<00:02:39.549> but

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
you'll be on your story obviously but

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.949 
you'll be on your story obviously but
you<00:02:40.640> want<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.850> go<00:02:40.970> into<00:02:41.120> these<00:02:41.209> special<00:02:41.630> events

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
you want to go into these special events

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.560 
you want to go into these special events
and<00:02:42.400> go<00:02:43.400> into<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.670> daily<00:02:44.030> event<00:02:44.269> called

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and go into the daily event called

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.720 
and go into the daily event called
proving<00:02:45.170> grounds<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.100> always<00:02:46.459> this

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
proving grounds so this is always this

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.100 
proving grounds so this is always this
has<00:02:46.970> always<00:02:47.180> been<00:02:47.329> that's<00:02:47.690> always<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.079> to

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
has always been that's always going to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.610 
has always been that's always going to
be<00:02:48.200> there<00:02:48.440> hopefully<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:50.269> I've<00:02:50.840> 100%

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
be there hopefully and I've 100%

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.729 
be there hopefully and I've 100%
completed<00:02:52.220> easy<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.000> medium<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:54.620> if

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
completed easy and medium and so if

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.170 
completed easy and medium and so if
you're<00:02:54.860> looking<00:02:54.950> for<00:02:55.370> obviously<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.880> tier<00:02:56.150> 1

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
you're looking for obviously the tier 1

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.210 
you're looking for obviously the tier 1
canvas<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.829> go<00:02:58.040> into<00:02:58.340> easy<00:02:59.110> and<00:03:00.110> if<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:00.980> are

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
canvas you go into easy and if you are

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.860 
canvas you go into easy and if you are
looking<00:03:01.489> at<00:03:01.760> actually<00:03:02.390> I'll<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:02.510> show<00:03:02.810> you

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
looking at actually I'll just show you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.140 
looking at actually I'll just show you
so<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:04.940> just<00:03:05.060> go<00:03:05.239> into<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:06.489> bomb<00:03:09.910> if<00:03:10.910> it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
so if we just go into this bomb if it's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.220 
so if we just go into this bomb if it's
gonna<00:03:11.390> load<00:03:12.730> 31<00:03:13.730> okay<00:03:13.970> there<00:03:14.090> we<00:03:14.150> go<00:03:14.209> okay<00:03:15.200> so

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
gonna load 31 okay there we go okay so

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.710 
gonna load 31 okay there we go okay so
if<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:16.070> want<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.310> guaranteed<00:03:16.880> catalyst<00:03:17.269> or<00:03:17.510> I

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
if you want a guaranteed catalyst or I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.449 
if you want a guaranteed catalyst or I
say<00:03:18.170> wait<00:03:18.350> sometimes<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:18.950> gives<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.130> isolate

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
say wait sometimes it gives you isolate

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.979 
say wait sometimes it gives you isolate
like<00:03:19.609> water<00:03:19.760> happened<00:03:20.060> before<00:03:20.329> you're<00:03:20.840> going

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
like water happened before you're going

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.140 
like water happened before you're going
to<00:03:21.049> want<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> go<00:03:21.350> on<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.890> harder<00:03:22.579> opponent

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
to want to go on the harder opponent

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.340 
to want to go on the harder opponent
side<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.510> as<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:23.780> see<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:24.230> a

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
side so as you can see this like a

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.690 
side so as you can see this like a
there's<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.220> side<00:03:25.459> with<00:03:26.200> 100<00:03:27.200> 105<00:03:27.950> 98

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
there's like one side with 100 105 98

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.670 
there's like one side with 100 105 98
champions<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:30.019> want<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.260> go<00:03:30.350> on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.500> side

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
champions you want to go on the side

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.530 
champions you want to go on the side
with<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:30.890> spider-man<00:03:31.400> version<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.120> Black

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
with the spider-man version and Black

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.270 
with the spider-man version and Black
Bolt<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.959> all<00:03:33.049> those<00:03:33.260> because<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.010> will

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
Bolt and all those because that will

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.420 
Bolt and all those because that will
give<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.579> pretty<00:03:35.269> much<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.510> definite<00:03:36.430> catalyst

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
give you pretty much a definite catalyst

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.640 
give you pretty much a definite catalyst
so<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.820> go<00:03:38.000> on<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.180> harder<00:03:38.540> side<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.079> that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
so you go on the harder side and that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.990 
so you go on the harder side and that
will<00:03:39.799> give<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.130> catalyst<00:03:40.430> we<00:03:40.579> go<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
will give you the catalyst we go on the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.930 
will give you the catalyst we go on the
easier<00:03:41.900> side<00:03:42.169> then<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.859> probably<00:03:43.519> won't<00:03:43.760> give

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
easier side then it probably won't give

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.170 
easier side then it probably won't give
you<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.180> catalyst<00:03:45.220> unless<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.370> haven't

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
you the catalyst unless you haven't

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.569 
you the catalyst unless you haven't
been<00:03:47.269> gone<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.629> do<00:03:47.719> it<00:03:47.780> yet<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.859> am<00:03:48.920> now

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
been gone and do it yet but I am now

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.069 
been gone and do it yet but I am now
going<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.849> go<00:03:50.000> into<00:03:50.239> our<00:03:50.659> hopefully<00:03:51.019> it

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
going to go into our hopefully it

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.959 
going to go into our hopefully it
doesn't<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:53.599> have<00:03:53.689> to<00:03:53.810> quit<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:54.200> quest<00:03:54.500> I

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
doesn't can we have to quit this quest I

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.330 
doesn't can we have to quit this quest I
was<00:03:55.969> quickly<00:03:56.180> quit<00:03:56.540> it

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
was quickly quit it

was quickly quit it
um<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.900> just<00:04:00.560> quit<00:04:01.129> our<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.670> just<00:04:01.909> wasted

um so just quit our that I just wasted

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.300 
um so just quit our that I just wasted
energy<00:04:02.450> didn't<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:02.900> crap<00:04:04.840> okay<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:05.900> also<00:04:06.620> with

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
energy didn't it crap okay so also with

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.949 
energy didn't it crap okay so also with
the<00:04:07.549> medium<00:04:07.969> one<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.389> hard<00:04:08.599> one

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
the medium one and the hard one

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.069 
the medium one and the hard one
Oh<00:04:08.989> child<00:04:09.650> escoba<00:04:09.950> can<00:04:10.219> do<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:11.599> medium<00:04:11.930> one

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
Oh child escoba can do the medium one

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.890 
Oh child escoba can do the medium one
which<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.349> was<00:04:12.469> doing<00:04:12.709> before<00:04:13.450> that's<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.689> one

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
which I was doing before that's the one

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.680 
which I was doing before that's the one
that<00:04:15.139> gives<00:04:15.439> you<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.590> catalyst<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.570> then<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
that gives you the catalyst and then the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.330 
that gives you the catalyst and then the
hard<00:04:17.900> one<00:04:18.049> also<00:04:18.440> gives<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.829> catalyst<00:04:19.190> as

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
hard one also gives you the catalyst as

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.939 
hard one also gives you the catalyst as
well<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:19.759> then<00:04:20.150> if<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.570> need<00:04:20.780> specific<00:04:21.259> tier

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
well and then if you need specific tier

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.820 
well and then if you need specific tier
catalysts<00:04:22.599> you<00:04:23.599> go<00:04:23.780> into<00:04:24.020> these<00:04:24.169> daily<00:04:24.530> events

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
catalysts you go into these daily events

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.159 
catalysts you go into these daily events
if<00:04:24.979> if<00:04:25.610> your<00:04:25.910> champion<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.870> need<00:04:27.050> to

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
if if your champion that you need to

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.580 
if if your champion that you need to
upgrade<00:04:27.380> or<00:04:27.860> rank<00:04:28.099> up<00:04:28.280> is<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:29.030> science<00:04:29.590> champion

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
upgrade or rank up is a science champion

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.980 
upgrade or rank up is a science champion
then<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.669> just<00:04:31.880> wait<00:04:32.120> for<00:04:32.150> this<00:04:32.570> science

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
then you just wait for this science

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.659 
then you just wait for this science
daily<00:04:33.259> event<00:04:33.620> or<00:04:33.800> just<00:04:34.009> hope<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.310> get<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.550> in

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
daily event or just hope to get it in

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.749 
daily event or just hope to get it in
like<00:04:34.940> vs.<00:04:35.750> or<00:04:36.289> arena<00:04:36.860> or<00:04:37.160> something<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:37.639> that

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
like vs. or arena or something like that

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.939 
like vs. or arena or something like that
or<00:04:37.910> out<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:39.970> crystal<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:42.440> then<00:04:42.770> this

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
or out of a crystal and then this

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.980 
or out of a crystal and then this
obviously<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.460> special<00:04:43.820> event<00:04:44.090> no<00:04:44.690> one<00:04:44.810> can

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
obviously the special event no one can

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.300 
obviously the special event no one can
get<00:04:45.139> past<00:04:45.169> that<00:04:45.500> beyond<00:04:45.949> hope<00:04:47.440> 99.999999<00:04:48.440> okay

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
get past that beyond hope 99.999999 okay

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.040 
get past that beyond hope 99.999999 okay
so<00:04:49.370> let's<00:04:49.669> get<00:04:49.820> back<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.270> our<00:04:50.300> champions<00:04:50.900> and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
so let's get back to our champions and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.589 
so let's get back to our champions and
let's<00:04:51.349> rank<00:04:51.979> up<00:04:52.159> a<00:04:52.400> champion<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.330> you're<00:04:53.479> gonna

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
let's rank up a champion so you're gonna

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.969 
let's rank up a champion so you're gonna
need<00:04:53.659> for<00:04:53.960> ranking<00:04:54.260> up<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.440> champion<00:04:54.830> is

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
need for ranking up a champion is

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.980 
need for ranking up a champion is
obviously<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.610> ISO<00:04:55.760> eight<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.180> make<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.539> at

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
obviously the ISO eight to make it at

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.710 
obviously the ISO eight to make it at
max<00:04:57.710> out<00:04:57.889> level<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.310> can't<00:04:58.520> isolate<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.599> up

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
max out level so you can't isolate it up

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.670 
max out level so you can't isolate it up
anymore<00:05:00.639> you're<00:05:01.639> going<00:05:01.849> to<00:05:02.060> need<00:05:02.680> the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
anymore you're going to need the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.920 
anymore you're going to need the
catalyst<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.220> asked<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.610> so<00:05:04.820> I<00:05:05.030> have<00:05:05.539> now

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
catalyst that I asked you so I have now

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.689 
catalyst that I asked you so I have now
got<00:05:06.139> all<00:05:06.320> five<00:05:06.620> tier<00:05:06.949> two<00:05:07.099> back<00:05:07.310> basic

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
got all five tier two back basic

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.100 
got all five tier two back basic
catalysts<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.710> they<00:05:10.360> required<00:05:11.360> catalyst<00:05:11.900> for

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
catalysts and they required catalyst for

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.890 
catalysts and they required catalyst for
that<00:05:12.169> champions<00:05:13.419> than<00:05:14.419> what<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:14.690> called

there<00:05:59.040> we<00:05:59.130> go<00:05:59.160> that<00:05:59.460> levels<00:05:59.760> are<00:05:59.850> up<00:06:00.830> boom

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
there we go that levels are up boom

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.530 
there we go that levels are up boom
level<00:06:02.430> up<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.610> level<00:06:02.700> 30<00:06:03.090> get<00:06:03.840> those<00:06:05.180> get<00:06:06.180> those

rank<00:06:09.540> up<00:06:09.750> things<00:06:10.230> you<00:06:10.560> know<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.680> catalyst

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
rank up things you know like catalyst

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.970 
rank up things you know like catalyst
and<00:06:11.310> stuff<00:06:11.490> but<00:06:12.300> if<00:06:12.480> you<00:06:12.750> do<00:06:12.960> need<00:06:13.230> if<00:06:13.620> you<00:06:13.830> have

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
and stuff but if you do need if you have

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.160 
and stuff but if you do need if you have
a<00:06:14.010> four-star<00:06:14.700> champion<00:06:15.090> you<00:06:15.570> want<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.810> rank<00:06:15.960> up

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
a four-star champion you want to rank up

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.020 
a four-star champion you want to rank up
that<00:06:16.650> champion<00:06:17.810> then<00:06:18.810> you<00:06:19.020> are<00:06:19.140> going<00:06:19.380> to<00:06:20.030> need

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
that champion then you are going to need

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.830 
that champion then you are going to need
an<00:06:21.270> alpha<00:06:21.540> catalyst<00:06:22.170> and<00:06:22.820> so<00:06:23.820> they<00:06:24.570> are<00:06:24.630> pretty

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
an alpha catalyst and so they are pretty

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.840 
an alpha catalyst and so they are pretty
hard<00:06:25.170> to<00:06:25.320> come<00:06:25.500> by<00:06:25.710> you're<00:06:26.400> gonna<00:06:26.580> need<00:06:26.790> a

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850
