00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello let's do some watercolors 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:12.519
 easy at home you need a bucket 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.080
 and a little bit of food coloring what 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.140
 first thing we're going to do is fill it 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.910
 with water and now with a stick we're going 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 taking a little of each color and 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.060
 we just mix it up like I do not have 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.830
 so many dyes I will make some 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.359
 how many of the same color to put enough 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.560
 dye because with the water it goes to 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.810
 get very diluted here does not look good on 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.850
 color but I'll show it when I finish what 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.400
 you will see everything dark because I will not be covered 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.830
 it's white 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.750
 you can make mixtures you can place one 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.370
 yellow and mix with a blue by 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 example to green if you do not have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 green coloring and so on the blue with 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 red for violet orange you get it out 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.100
 from red and yellow too 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.160
 you can make some more clear of 3 more 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.050
 dark putting more or less coloring 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.940
 Well, here I have it finished as 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.860
 You see, I have a range of colors 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.350
 and now you can imagine what I 'm going to do 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.200
 which is to freeze but before so that it 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.910
 can you pick some chopsticks if 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.940
 you do not have sticks that I have these 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.520
 sticks with ice cream sticks to which 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.010
 you can use these I have taken them from a 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.890
 cafeteria that serve good 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.510
 you serve as a spoon 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.490
 Come on, it has taken a few 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.590
 but to hold on I have put a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.300
 double layer of aluminum foil you have 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 seen you can put three or four papers 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.110
 to make it thicker, you go palpando 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.720
 where is the ulna hole and in 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.150
 the middle you think your stick more 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.700
 vertical that you can then they will not see a 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.200
 little bit will also happen to you, I'm going to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.470
 solve so they do not move with a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.910
 little paper napkin paper 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.890
 carefully put it in the middle of the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.000
 two strips if you put them well what is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.300
 important is that when I'm in the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 freezer are well vertical they 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.990
 move a lot let it freeze half 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.410
 horita and when they are a little bit more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.840
 hard to replace the sticks 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.650
 6 do not touch my freezer are all 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.750
 straight more or less nothing we hope for then 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.750
 he placed it we wait for it to freeze 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.230
 whatever your freezer so 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 normal to freeze a couple of hours 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.140
 three or four I do not know well then here 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.250
 the ruckus with the children who have taken 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.220
 to remove the voice so you do not panic 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.110
 of the mess I have at home and good 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.640
 have been left as they come out very frozen what 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.530
 What I have done is to wet them a little 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.560
 underneath with hot water so they can 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.900
 order to give my average 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.599
 and here I have three more paint 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.470
 but remember that it is watercolor type 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.120
 daniela as always integrating the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.230
 conversion that nothing would happen because 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.920
 you know it's water with coloring 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.920
 food 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.830
 if you've seen how easy it is fast and 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.830
 economic of other means
