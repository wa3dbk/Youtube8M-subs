00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 as we have been told 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.020
 here from the residents directly the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.189
 was directly affected was a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.420
 pretty loud blow and they have 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.130
 Just notice that I myself 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 Everyone has seen that affected 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 just the parts from the bank the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.500
 sockets have been shattered and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.510
 the equipment had just failed 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
 power was gone then the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.720
 Firefighters in the city area 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 june in the city â€‹â€‹area distributed to almost 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 all reports this very violent and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 flash lightning they have all noticed and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 immediately afterwards a very strong one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 thunder strike there was almost clear that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.840
 somewhere in the city of lightning 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 we must have beaten her 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.960
 on the way to this were used 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.399
 we are the same from the control center 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.590
 been called to another use 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.899
 and not in other parts of the city 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.210
 Immediately close to there has the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.280
 lightning 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 However, the buildings smashed 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.309
 the damages are not there 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.960
 dramatically the residents had one 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.640
 smoke development and also smell in the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.440
 cellar but apparently it was 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 only by overvoltage too 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.590
 a smoldering fire in the insulation 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.149
 but then there were none 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.260
 Major action required so that 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.850
 the fire department on this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.649
 could concentrate here 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.390
 If a joke is right in a building 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.210
 of course it can happen 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.830
 be that as massive here as the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.020
 outside areas chimney roof surface and 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.820
 so further affected 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.460
 We would have been there a few years ago 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 Almost the whole house was really it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.390
 It is almost not exaggerated when I say 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.340
 in ruins because all of it wall 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.780
 This lightning has a splintered one 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.270
 eerie energy and eerie 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.259
 Power is basically so it can always be 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.470
 According to fire 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.520
 Surge damage yes that's how it is 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.509
 main damage during a lightning strike 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.610
 basically even if the blow very 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.070
 Loudly, that means first of all, keep calm 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.750
 it does not do any good if they are natural 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.550
 in panic excite like that 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.740
 staircase falling travel somehow out 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.090
 to bring or what is to keep calm 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.560
 even if it comes to a fire 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.759
 should you have enough time left? 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.829
 leaving the building 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.649
 At this moment we guess they are going out 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.909
 Check the building it if it burns 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.439
 immediately inform the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.399
 Fire Department is best immediately if you 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.020
 Remember the lightning has with me 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.000
 struck it can also be 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.960
 that it comes only later to a fire 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.299
 because one 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.530
 Insulation and electrical cables smolder 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.149
 and only then followed in sequence 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.640
 rather once too much spreading the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.970
 Fire departments call 112 emergency call too 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.970
 little
