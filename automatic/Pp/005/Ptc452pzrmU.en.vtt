00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.190

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.179
I'm Joe Weisenfelder senior editor
of cars dot com

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.190
with the 2008 Hyundai VeraCruz that's
one of our favorite crossover vehicles

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.410
with three rows of seats

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.980
we want the details on this into videos
in 2007 very little has changed so you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.050
might wanna go to those

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.110
drop down menus and take a look at the
2007 spur the

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.010
overall picture what we're talking about
here is what has changed the first

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.770
ever navigation system from Hyundai is
in the Vera Cruz

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.090
Hyundai consider not offering navigation
systems at all they haven't for a long

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.420
time partly because

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.829
they tend to get out-of-date pretty
quickly you pay for them

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.839
they'd appreciate faster than the car
itself here

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.199
going to resell it you lose some of that
money what they've done instead is

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.739
they've added one but they haven't gone
quite as far as some the other guys do

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.949
its in the dashboard if the touch screen
and very easy to use it does what you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.639
need to do

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.899
what it doesn't have his wife activation
like some have and it doesn't offer a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.229
rearview camera a backup camera that
shows he was gonna behind you in for

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.830
the transmission in reverse everything's
pretty much self contained here

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.280
I know if the angle is in great I was
getting some glare

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.160
on it from the Sun and unlike someone
systems out there you can't push any

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.600
buttons and change the angle at that and
that's a little bit unfortunate

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.860
are you do open it like you do some love
them to get out

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.050
the CD player you do give up a CD
changer

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.680
if you go for this option and that
happens on some other vehicles to but

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.030
usually they offer you

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.160
another option to put a CD changer
someplace else

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.710
the air crews doesn't to take a closer
look at the controls are pretty much

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.450
standard

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.180
it has separate Zuma buttons as opposed
to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
little spot on the touchscreen I think
that's a good thing one thing I like a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.460
lot on this is there's a very simple

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.470
to reach on mute button so to get tired
here in this lady

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.750
please mister to demand you just said it
once and you're done without going into

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.190
a menu or anything like that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.880
also you can choose about the direction
of travel or North

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200
up as your you know where looking out of
both happened did the same thing in this

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.630
case

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.720
also if you wanted go with the 3d look

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.470
it gives you two dimensions are three
dimensions we are three dimensions

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.010
and it looks like this I like to see
more strength labeled then we're seeing

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.799
here at least

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.340
in the 3d view by go back to two
dimensions

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.810
it gets a little bit better

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.859
so if you're someone like me who's lost
all the time

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.739
and if you're like most people man
especially if you don't want to ask for

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.280
directions

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.499
it does all you need to do and it cost
less than the systems another car

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.840
if you absolutely must have a backup
camera you're out a lot here

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.420
I'd rather see Hyundai put the effort
into a stand-alone option

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.060
up for back-up camera which the
Highlander offers for just a few hundred

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.680
bucks

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.989
so you don't have to pay $2000 for
navigation when all you want to do is

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:53.629
make sure

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.810
you don't back up over your wife's
petunias for additional information on

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.370
this car or any other

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.120
got a car start com and our blog kicking
tires
