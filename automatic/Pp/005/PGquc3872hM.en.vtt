over the world it started to spread into
Europe<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.439> conflict<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.040> each<00:00:32.219> area

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520

Europe but the conflict in each area
which<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.239> i<00:00:33.270> love<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:34.380> different

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
which is what i love is very different

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.410 
which is what i love is very different
because<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.219> wars<00:00:35.399> raging<00:00:35.730> very<00:00:36.030> differently

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
toward by the end of modern warfare 2

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.979 
toward by the end of modern warfare 2
but<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.340> Europe<00:00:42.030> there's<00:00:42.540> still<00:00:42.750> very

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
but in Europe there's still very

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
but in Europe there's still very
populated<00:00:43.500> cities<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.190> had<00:00:44.640> their<00:00:44.820> local

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
populated cities they had their local

are<00:00:46.920> fighting<00:00:47.129> alongside<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.450> things<00:00:48.690> like

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
are fighting alongside like things like

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.299 
are fighting alongside like things like
the<00:00:48.930> British<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> yes<00:00:49.620> trying<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the British that's a yes trying to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
the British that's a yes trying to
figure<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.780> what<00:00:51.780> how<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.230> conflict<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
figure out what how this conflict is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
figure out what how this conflict is
unfolding<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:54.030> their<00:00:54.210> countries<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
unfolding and how their countries and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.360 
unfolding and how their countries and
cities<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.559> pulled<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
cities are going to be pulled into it so

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
cities are going to be pulled into it so
we<00:00:56.789> follow<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.170> importantly

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
we follow that but but more importantly

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
we follow that but but more importantly
we<00:00:58.710> need<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.949> figure<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.219> what's<00:01:00.000> happened

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
we need to figure out what's happened

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.330 
we need to figure out what's happened
attach<00:01:00.600> force<00:01:00.870> 141<00:01:01.320> by<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> end<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> modern

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
attach force 141 by the end of modern

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.680 
attach force 141 by the end of modern
warfare<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.820> they<00:01:03.000> were<00:01:03.059> either<00:01:03.239> dead<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.539> on

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
warfare two they were either dead or on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
warfare two they were either dead or on
the<00:01:03.899> run<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.010> figure<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.339> how<00:01:05.549> these

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the run and so we figure out how these

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.600 
the run and so we figure out how these
three<00:01:06.540> stories<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:07.530> arc<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:08.159> each<00:01:08.400> other

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
three stories really arc into each other

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
three stories really arc into each other
into<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> global<00:01:09.299> conflict<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.200> gameplay

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
into the global conflict the gameplay

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.710 
into the global conflict the gameplay
the<00:01:11.220> rules<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> engagement<00:01:11.720> everything

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the rules of engagement everything

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
the rules of engagement everything
changes<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.560> these<00:01:13.650> different<00:01:14.100> environments

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
changes in these different environments

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
changes in these different environments
when<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.360> you're<00:01:15.479> dealing<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.890> know

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
when when you're dealing with a you know

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.100 
when when you're dealing with a you know
a<00:01:17.040> city<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.939> London<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.600> fighting<00:01:18.930> through

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
a city like London of fighting through

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.929 
a city like London of fighting through
the<00:01:19.200> tube<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.770> having<00:01:20.340> these<00:01:20.430> people<00:01:20.759> there

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the tube and having these people there

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.359 
the tube and having these people there
who<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.180> cross<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> crossfire<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
who are cross on the crossfire of you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.830 
who are cross on the crossfire of you
know<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.970> fight<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.659> different

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
know the way you fight is very different

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
know the way you fight is very different
and<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> spawns<00:01:25.619> things<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.250> gameplay

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and that spawns things like gameplay

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
and that spawns things like gameplay
mechanics<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> things<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.659> we've<00:01:27.810> added<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
mechanics and things that we've added to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
mechanics and things that we've added to
the<00:01:28.290> game<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> result<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.570> moving

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the game that are a result of moving

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.319 
the game that are a result of moving
from<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.590> outskirts<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.060> dense

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
from the outskirts into these more dense

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
from the outskirts into these more dense
urban<00:01:33.540> environments<00:01:34.380> things<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.100> dual

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
urban environments things like the dual

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
urban environments things like the dual
scope<00:01:35.640> system<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.659> you'll<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:37.049> when

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
scope system that that you'll see when

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.600 
scope system that that you'll see when
you're<00:01:37.350> fighting<00:01:37.650> through<00:01:37.860> Manhattan<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you're fighting through Manhattan that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.609 
you're fighting through Manhattan that
allows<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.329> change<00:01:39.750> your<00:01:39.900> scope<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.500> the
