00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 welcome friends with you again 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.589
 myth league this release will be completely in 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.570
 rf mode and as usual if you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 liked it then put your thumbs up 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.179
 we have several myths ahead so don't 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.130
 will delay the first question is possible 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 I use the ulta 2 or more times 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 in a row maybe you are worth a little 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.880
 squander video because it is lightly 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 tightened up but as you can see i use 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 first ultu for drayvena through the entire map 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.390
 and because of my third 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.969
 level to 16 level, the hero 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 recharged it pretty quickly yet 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.290
 My first ulta comes back to me 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 enemy base I jump to my base and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.930
 as you see it unfolds in my 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 the side 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.180
 My ulta recharged I throw the second 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.250
 and returning to the previous place on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.559
 minimap are clearly visible for ults which 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 stones fly and while they fly into my 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.680
 side and again jump to the base and throw 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.610
 3 ultu 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 in short yes it is possible the next 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 is it possible to fully 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.640
 control the champion until his death in 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
 In rf mode it was a bit more difficult. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 check but after many many attempts 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 we finally managed to consistently 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.920
 control it all long enough 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.470
 time i'm trying to move but just not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.229
 can i kill with full hp under 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.180
 infinite control the next question 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.790
 is it possible to block someone on 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 fountains using walls of champions this 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.869
 more dependent on the case but still 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.820
 cool before the resurrection 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.409
 enemy champion after death can 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 install it in your fountain 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.390
 Using veshku aniway and post Trundle 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.400
 and although the champion can use his 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.320
 skills to get out or use 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.799
 jump or teleport but chip anyway 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.350
 it works and now it is interesting to continue 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.960
 Fox call for rune after level 18 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.659
 for those who do not know in ult mode 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.689
 you can achieve a maximum level of 30 and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.670
 not as usual 18 you probably don't know 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.159
 but I like runes that reach 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.469
 limit at level 18 as shown in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.390
 description of the runes and so because of the fact that 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.939
 the maximum level will be increased 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 runes continue to scan and after 18 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.310
 level draven grows and drink more 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.940
 nothing but he has 110 base 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.630
 damage when getting level 19 and a p a d 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.960
 a true 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.850
 tinted above limit 18 level 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.070
 it turns out that above level 18 is scanned 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.800
 not only the runes but the effects of the skills too 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.540
 but for those who are interested in such as 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.730
 tristans who have passive 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.420
 scan a train live auto attack too 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.920
 will call up to thirtieth level 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.240
 will ulta wai work when the target passes 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.060
 through several portals 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.950
 it was verified given that bart could 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.470
 put several portals very quickly 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.870
 in ur ava mode follows the enemy with 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.790
 using my ulta I set my own 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.070
 portals qui she used ulta on 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.410
 me and i jump back and immediately into 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.350
 the second new is still haunting me and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.280
 despite the prescribed script 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.610
 using multiple quarters 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.230
 in a row do not interfere with the cult 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.580
 the next question is how long can you talk about 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.010
 keep the enemy in the air 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.990
 in a similar way we tested infinite 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.180
 control and it took too 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.370
 a lot of attempts and still 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.380
 it turned out not perfect but as you see 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.960
 all champions are constantly using 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.670
 air control again and again so 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.620
 I practically can't move 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.380
 and although there were a couple of moments where almost 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.610
 touched the ground but it's hard to say however 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.470
 if you succeed perfectly 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.320
 you can cooperate 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.540
 to crank without problems will be able to thrash 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.490
 throw two lanterns to save an ally 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 in thanks to fast recharge mode 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.870
 urs we all like thrash that can 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.330
 get an ally out of a serious situation 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.030
 throwing him a flashlight they just click on 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.370
 him and transferred to a safe place but 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.650
 it seems that thrash can throw in rv mode 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.890
 two lights at once and two different ally 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.050
 can take them simultaneously and be saved 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.260
 if you're interested, then one ally can 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.910
 take two lanterns one by one and 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.280
 last myth for today how many flags 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.870
 can put jarvan 4 at the same time and 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.360
 how to work with them . 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.670
 after pumping the flag jarvan and to the fifth 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.010
 its recharge level is minimal 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.349
 if i start with memory then how you see 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.239
 I have three at a time, and if 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.550
 I will try to put 4 then the first 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.920
 disappears it seems that the maximum can 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.569
 put three flags as regards 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.850
 interactions to a yushka with several 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.280
 flags that seems that it touches most 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.320
 far flacca jarvan and even if you 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.540
 worth 2 or 3 flags one after another and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.730
 the book hits all three flags or 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.370
 all 2 flags then it will just cling 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.180
 the most distant and here's something else for those 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.520
 who is interested 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.410
 several standing flags near jarvan a 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.720
 or another ally will not increase 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.630
 attack speed for each flag only 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.100
 one of the flags will be valid 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.139
 a small bonus that does not apply chickens 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.350
 prizhima the visible range of the 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.180
 the books are completely fuzzy that is clearly 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.160
 it can be seen that the club does not reach the flag 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.560
 however he still clings to him 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.800
 just so you know if you will play 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.169
 for jarvan a or against him on this to 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.910
 sorry everyone thanks for watching not 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.570
 forget to share with friends and 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.250
 see you in the next issue
