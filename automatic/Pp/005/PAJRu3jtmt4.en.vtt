because<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.920> love<00:02:17.340> OPI<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.210> they<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.960> very

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
because I love OPI and they have a very

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.340

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.860 
it every Sunday although recently i
haven't<00:02:26.700> mentioned<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.330> get<00:02:27.450> every<00:02:27.570> sunday

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and the reason for that is just that I

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.150 
and the reason for that is just that I
haven't<00:02:30.090> had<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.360> lot<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> time<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.080> do<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.320> so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
haven't had a lot of time to do that so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.650 
haven't had a lot of time to do that so

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.560 
it darks or brights i'm going to say i
actually<00:03:35.160> don't<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.520> because<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.090> depends

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
actually don't know because it depends

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.030 
actually don't know because it depends
on<00:03:36.750> what<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.080> would<00:03:37.170> consider<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.740> color

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
on what you would consider this color

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.430 
on what you would consider this color
because<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.820> does<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.600> like<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> bright

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
because it does have like a bright

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.500 
because it does have like a bright
reflex<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.490> it<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> little<00:03:42.150> bit<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.420> a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
reflex but it is a little bit of a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.290 
reflex but it is a little bit of a
darker<00:03:42.870> color<00:03:43.110> i<00:03:43.380> usually<00:03:44.220> tend<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.180> for

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
darker color i usually tend to go for

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.370 
darker color i usually tend to go for
more<00:03:45.810> bright<00:03:46.170> blues<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.280> brighter<00:03:47.550> colors

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
more bright blues and brighter colors

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.110 
more bright blues and brighter colors
just<00:03:49.380> because<00:03:49.709> I've<00:03:50.010> never<00:03:50.040> worn<00:03:50.520> black<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:51.030> my

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
just because I've never worn black on my

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.440 
just because I've never worn black on my
nails<00:03:51.360> ever<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> very<00:03:54.240> dark

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
nails ever and so that is a very dark

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.040 
nails ever and so that is a very dark
color<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.770> do<00:03:56.400> tends<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.270> just<00:03:57.390> mix<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.840> up<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
color but I do tends to just mix it up a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.230 
color but I do tends to just mix it up a
little<00:03:58.080> bit<00:03:58.320> but<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.280> would<00:03:59.790> definitely<00:03:59.940> say

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
little bit but I would definitely say

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.270 
little bit but I would definitely say
brights<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.170> most<00:04:01.350> part<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:02.100> are<00:04:02.190> you
