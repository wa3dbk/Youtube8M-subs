 director of the company express import in 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 last video I showed you how to do 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 our hamsters are big in the factory 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.840
 thanks for the feedback 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.120
 man flew to beijing and show you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.570
 how to make our bouquets of soft toys 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.670
 which we sell for more than three years 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 the plant operates on conveyor technology 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.939
 from the production line itself 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.160
 nevertheless every worker performs 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.960
 its task is first cut 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 metal shelf of a certain length and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.769
 if a person puts toys on her 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 other manufacturers including 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.219
 individual masters in Russia more often 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 total glue sticking toys on 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.180
 special plastic sticks 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.070
 certainly speeds up the production process 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 but when transporting toys very 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.120
 often peeled off besides the bouquet 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 made based on chopsticks and impossible 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.910
 setting up wire bouquets is easy 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.320
 cracking down and getting more lush 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.239
 after sitting on the wire toys 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 buds are clothed tightly 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.030
 secured with metal brackets with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.710
 using a special device then 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.910
 toys are tied together in such 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 amount in on whom she will not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.339
 presented in a bouquet and transmitted to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.339
 packing 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.230
 purchase begins with preparation 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.970
 The material is prepared wrapping paper 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.490
 packing tape unwound from poppies 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.930
 and cut the last few guys 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.090
 it is from this process that the tape 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.350
 It turned out crookedly cut off I got 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.600
 many negative reviews on this 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.100
 it was suggested to use 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.350
 hot scissors and we specifically bought 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.510
 alone but not less often just like 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.820
 ordinary scissors and tape edges are not 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.040
 refuel solve this question two 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.720
 ways worker now reel 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.550
 less tape they are all reel 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.050
 before pruning then all the bouquets 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.440
 additionally checked before 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.600
 Packed in the bag and then cut 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.700
 the required amount of organza you this 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.190
 the process may not really like it and they 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.630
 just chop argut but all these c 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.530
 baths and edges then in a special way 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.090
 still hiding during the last visit 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.760
 factory, we have developed a method 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.560
 packing a bouquet such that all edges 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.510
 organza were inside the bouquet 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 unfortunately you have to constantly 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.170
 control these moments so how on 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 packaging in this way takes more 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.120
 quantities of material and strength of workers 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.590
 now you are watching the perry process 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.750

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.370
 stand the whole party made by day 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.930
 previously turned out to be wrong wrapped and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.760
 bouquets are now being redone 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.330

 ask here to buy a bouquet and then what 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.209
 I do with him to put the vase so 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.580
 designers had the idea to make bouquets 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.930
 having their own stand but 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.330
