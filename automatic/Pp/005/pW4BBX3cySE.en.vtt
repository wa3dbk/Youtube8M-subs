00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.670
 hi friends today fishing 2 mail.com 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.330
 we want to teach us how to mount a zeal 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.100
 for carp 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.060
 with your mind little paraguay leo pÃ©rez 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.660
 we have chosen a curved hook 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.369
 by ring and a thread drawn for 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.650
 start let's make the bow where 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.040
 we will place the pen 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.310
 we are an extreme and we talk about the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.310
 moral 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 let's take 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.590
 and simply 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 we treat badly 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.240
 as much as possible 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.290
 now 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.450
 and we would have it then a little 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.450
 we will adjust the adjustment 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.650
 I'm OK 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.730
 perfect to what we are going to do 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.610
 is to make a safety knot so that 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.850
 do not modify this bow we just 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 to do 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.720
 is done the simple thing is not necessary 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.890
 desire 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.890
 we cut the excess 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.159
 and I would be ready for where we're going 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 ready for 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.340
 pass our needle 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.520
 and we spent all the office 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.400
 what we are going to do next 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.070
 is to mount the direct flower 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.950
 we take these only that before we doubled the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.320
 tip was much shorter for 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.899
 and just below what was a 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.159
 passionate to make a tie just below 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.909
 let's put the blue 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.659
 adjusted to the ring just below the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.659
 end of the loop 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.700
 we adjust quite 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.040
 and nothing then what we have now 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.370
 what to do 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.370
 is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
 Turning this stretch something 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.720
 then at the end and each our yellow 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 for the turns on the hook and the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.090
 loop ok let's start 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.599
 the turns are soft, it's worth not 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.099
 squeeze a lot tight but do not 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.930
 lack we press a lot the important thing is 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.739
 that is well placed so that then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.739
 when we have 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.480
 you can compress the knot well 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.690
 we follow the turns so good in 3 10 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.660
 12 depending on the size of the soil is 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.150
 teeny 8 in short 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.440
 good we have here in our lacito 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.320
 you can see here our bow 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.810
 now let's go over the long end 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.810
 we place are rolling by the lacito 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.730
 once passed by the bow 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.730
 we are going to pass it 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.220
 by the mile 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.130
 in a sense we are going to work 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.189
 and go back to 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.189
 Hello 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.280
 the tasks do not in fact after this side 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.450
 and now we only have to do a little bit 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:48.040
 tie that we have left for that we would throw 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.040
 from this end also lazaro 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.650
 then 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.090
 and we would do more let's help the tasting 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.440
 not to click, simple is very useful 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.440
 and we think 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.530
 place in knots 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.569
 and then using 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.499
 on the other side too 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.499
 It is important 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.440
 and little by little placing repeat the 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.750
 several times until it compresses well 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.960
 all the turns are tight on the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.960
 knot 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.520
 and finally you will see 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.340
 as in a compressed war 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.479
 and we put it well and we have our 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.889
 bow for our pellet model let's go 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.280
 to hang one so you can see how 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.280
 remains 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.060
 we take a boli it is worth previously 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.910
 drilled with a drill 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.790
 with the dareyes command to break it 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.220
 and do not crack it hold well then 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.220
 to introduce the needle to the single 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.330
 and later you have to take the bow 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.199
 what we did at the beginning of the whole 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.990
 with the needle 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:26.260
 after the closing simply you will spend it 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.720
 we make it happen to our return 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.090
 then we are going to put a 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.700
 a little touch in this case is going to be 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.740
 a wire I recommend that the rays well 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.990
 the wire so that it does not escape and then 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.210
 when I retrieved the hook if it has 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.340
 broken the boli you put a new one 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.430
 using the same lick and so we 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.580
 we save pollute a little 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:54.290
 but it never hurts to contaminate 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.920
 a lot and you have to try to take care 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.920
 all right 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:05.000
 we escaped many already made backwards and 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.680
 we already have the goal mounted and if 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.030
 you want to adjust a tad more then you 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.390
 you give a couple of turns around the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.900
 ground 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.900
 now 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.969
 here it will be mounted exactly 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.969
 our grandfather 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.870
 would apply and then would jump 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.999
 because it always captures and jumps is worth 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.020
 we really need 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:34.169
 Well, thank you very much later with 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.719
