00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.449 

but<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:26.189> think<00:02:26.939> that<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.269> does<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:28.049> mean<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.920> didn't

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
but I think that it does I mean I didn't

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.929 
but I think that it does I mean I didn't
buy<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> windshield<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:32.040> improve<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.760> look

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
buy the windshield to improve the look

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.330 
buy the windshield to improve the look
of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> bike<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.379> makes<00:02:34.590> any<00:02:34.680> sense<00:02:34.829> I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
of the bike if that makes any sense I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.100 
of the bike if that makes any sense I
mean<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.519> think<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.150> takes<00:02:36.390> away<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> little

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
mean I think that it takes away a little

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
mean I think that it takes away a little
bit<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> aggressiveness<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.489> them<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
bit of the aggressiveness to them you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.940 
bit of the aggressiveness to them you
know<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.480> whole<00:02:39.659> front<00:02:40.019> end<00:02:40.170> being<00:02:41.720> awesome

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
know the whole front end being awesome

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.039 
know the whole front end being awesome
but<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> doesn't<00:02:44.430> look<00:02:44.579> bad<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.180> mean<00:02:45.629> it's<00:02:45.840> got

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
but it doesn't look bad I mean it's got

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.580

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.289 
there's a little arm right there and you
just<00:03:44.040> turn<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.370> put<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.640> key<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.120> and

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
just turn it put the key in here and

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.990 
just turn it put the key in here and
turn<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.659> in<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> arm<00:03:46.079> lifts<00:03:46.709> it's<00:03:47.610> got<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> hook

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
turn it in the arm lifts it's got a hook

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.759 
turn it in the arm lifts it's got a hook
on<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.450> arm<00:03:48.599> lifts<00:03:48.989> up<00:03:49.110> off<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.650> way

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
on it and the arm lifts up off that way

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.880 
on it and the arm lifts up off that way
you<00:03:49.829> can<00:03:50.099> just<00:03:50.129> push<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.530> here's<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.620> side<00:03:52.860> view

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
you can just push it here's a side view

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.899 
you can just push it here's a side view
how<00:03:54.079> so<00:03:55.079> you<00:03:55.140> put<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:56.189> on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.519> bottom

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
how so you put this one on the bottom

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.830 
how so you put this one on the bottom
set<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.569> in<00:03:57.689> there<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.849> then<00:03:59.849> roll

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
set it in there like this and then roll

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.770 
set it in there like this and then roll
it<00:04:01.049> on<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.409> way<00:04:01.849> up<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.299> these<00:04:03.420> these

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
it on that way up on that these these

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.170 
it on that way up on that these these
are<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.980> two<00:04:05.159> mounting<00:04:05.549> points<00:04:05.909> that<00:04:06.090> are

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
are the the two mounting points that are

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.259 
are the the two mounting points that are
mounted<00:04:06.329> onto<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.870> actual<00:04:07.970> amount<00:04:08.970> that

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
mounted onto the actual amount that

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.979 
mounted onto the actual amount that
amounts<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.439> forks<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:12.239> many<00:04:12.389> mounts<00:04:12.810> and

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
amounts to the forks so many mounts and

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.840 
amounts to the forks so many mounts and
one-sentence<00:04:13.709> was<00:04:13.920> crazy<00:04:16.160> but<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:17.729> right

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
this seriously correct on the gas mount

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.730 
this seriously correct on the gas mount
look<00:05:20.280> I've<00:05:21.000> still<00:05:21.210> got<00:05:21.570> maybe<00:05:22.020> an<00:05:22.230> eighth<00:05:22.470> of<00:05:22.650> a

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
look I've still got maybe an eighth of a

look I've still got maybe an eighth of a
tank<00:05:24.080> look<00:05:25.080> how<00:05:25.200> many<00:05:25.350> miles<00:05:25.590> I've<00:05:25.860> got<00:05:26.040> on

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
tank look how many miles I've got on

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.430 
tank look how many miles I've got on
this<00:05:26.220> tank<00:05:26.430> of<00:05:26.550> gas<00:05:27.950> 163<00:05:28.950> miles<00:05:30.050> when<00:05:31.050> my<00:05:31.200> dad

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
this tank of gas 163 miles when my dad

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.129 
this tank of gas 163 miles when my dad
takes<00:05:32.340> his<00:05:32.580> VTX<00:05:33.090> over<00:05:33.419> there<00:05:33.540> out<00:05:33.750> that's<00:05:34.020> a

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
takes his VTX over there out that's a

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.370 
takes his VTX over there out that's a
1300<00:05:34.950> it's<00:05:35.460> carbureted<00:05:36.150> but<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.540> 1300

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
1300 it's carbureted but it's a 1300

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.719 
1300 it's carbureted but it's a 1300
this<00:05:37.560> is<00:05:37.790> 1900<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:40.460> fuel-injected<00:05:41.460> which

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
this is 1900 and fuel-injected which

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.070 
this is 1900 and fuel-injected which
gets<00:05:41.970> better<00:05:42.180> gas<00:05:42.389> mileage<00:05:42.450> but<00:05:42.960> the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
gets better gas mileage but the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.520 
gets better gas mileage but the
displacement<00:05:43.410> is<00:05:43.830> just<00:05:44.040> so<00:05:44.190> big<00:05:44.840> but<00:05:45.840> he<00:05:46.290> gets

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
displacement is just so big but he gets

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.909 
displacement is just so big but he gets
a<00:05:46.800> hundred<00:05:47.220> and<00:05:47.340> twenty<00:05:47.700> miles<00:05:48.620> give<00:05:49.620> or<00:05:49.650> take

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
a hundred and twenty miles give or take

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.159 
a hundred and twenty miles give or take
a<00:05:49.979> couple<00:05:50.280> of<00:05:50.550> miles<00:05:50.790> maybe<00:05:51.120> five<00:05:51.510> plus<00:05:52.020> or

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
a couple of miles maybe five plus or

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.020 
a couple of miles maybe five plus or
minus<00:05:52.530> five<00:05:52.710> depends<00:05:53.190> on<00:05:53.310> how<00:05:53.520> he<00:05:53.580> was<00:05:53.850> riding

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
minus five depends on how he was riding

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.770 
minus five depends on how he was riding
and<00:05:54.330> he's<00:05:54.900> hitting<00:05:55.139> his<00:05:55.350> reserve<00:05:56.389> my<00:05:57.389> reserve

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
and he's hitting his reserve my reserve

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.409 
and he's hitting his reserve my reserve
law<00:05:58.050> I<00:05:58.080> guess<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:59.040> I<00:05:59.550> mean<00:05:59.729> if<00:05:59.880> I<00:06:00.000> think<00:06:00.270> this

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
law I guess that I mean if I think this

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.120 
law I guess that I mean if I think this
thing<00:06:00.630> has<00:06:00.810> an<00:06:00.960> automatic<00:06:01.320> Reserve<00:06:01.800> and<00:06:02.070> I

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
thing has an automatic Reserve and I

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.890 
thing has an automatic Reserve and I
guess<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.520> that<00:06:02.760> when<00:06:03.120> that<00:06:03.240> light<00:06:03.300> comes<00:06:03.750> on

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
guess that that when that light comes on

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.180 
guess that that when that light comes on
I<00:06:03.960> think<00:06:04.139> it's<00:06:04.410> supposed<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:04.680> be<00:06:04.800> an<00:06:04.889> orange

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
I think it's supposed to be an orange

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.540 
I think it's supposed to be an orange
light<00:06:05.600> that<00:06:06.600> has<00:06:06.840> a<00:06:07.229> reserve<00:06:07.740> and<00:06:08.840> it's<00:06:10.340> not<00:06:11.340> on

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
light that has a reserve and it's not on

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.350 
light that has a reserve and it's not on
and<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.390> still<00:06:12.630> have<00:06:12.780> that<00:06:13.020> much<00:06:13.340> on<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:15.060> tank

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
and I still have that much on this tank

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.480 
and I still have that much on this tank
and<00:06:15.630> I<00:06:17.270> wonder<00:06:18.270> how<00:06:18.300> big<00:06:18.419> the<00:06:18.960> reserve<00:06:19.320> is<00:06:19.680> see

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
and I wonder how big the reserve is see

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.610 
and I wonder how big the reserve is see
for<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:20.789> longest<00:06:21.090> time<00:06:21.180> I'd<00:06:21.570> see<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.229> get<00:06:22.410> down

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
for the longest time I'd see it get down

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.920 
for the longest time I'd see it get down
so<00:06:22.950> low<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.880> I'm<00:06:24.150> thinking<00:06:24.450> well<00:06:24.600> hell<00:06:24.750> there

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
so low and I'm thinking well hell there

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.570 
so low and I'm thinking well hell there
isn't<00:06:25.080> even<00:06:25.229> a<00:06:25.440> reserve<00:06:25.770> on<00:06:25.979> this<00:06:26.010> thing<00:06:26.370> it's

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
isn't even a reserve on this thing it's

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.000 
isn't even a reserve on this thing it's
just<00:06:26.669> a<00:06:26.910> straight<00:06:27.270> tank<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.810> know<00:06:27.960> you<00:06:28.830> got<00:06:28.979> a

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
just a straight tank you know you got a

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.529 
just a straight tank you know you got a
gas<00:06:29.250> gauge<00:06:29.550> you're<00:06:29.880> stupid<00:06:30.300> if<00:06:30.390> you're

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
gas gauge you're stupid if you're

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.469 
gas gauge you're stupid if you're
running<00:06:30.660> out<00:06:30.930> you<00:06:31.260> know<00:06:31.460> but<00:06:32.460> I<00:06:32.490> read<00:06:33.300> that

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
running out you know but I read that

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.840 
running out you know but I read that
there's<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.750> reserve<00:06:34.220> but<00:06:35.220> I've<00:06:35.310> got<00:06:35.490> a<00:06:35.520> hundred

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
there's a reserve but I've got a hundred

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.370 
there's a reserve but I've got a hundred
and<00:06:35.970> sixty<00:06:36.240> two<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:36.389> bet<00:06:36.720> you<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:36.930> could<00:06:37.080> probably

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
and sixty two I bet you I could probably

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.620 
and sixty two I bet you I could probably
get<00:06:37.590> another<00:06:37.889> 10-15<00:06:38.669> miles<00:06:38.940> out<00:06:39.210> of<00:06:39.240> this<00:06:39.419> tank

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
get another 10-15 miles out of this tank

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.650 
get another 10-15 miles out of this tank
of<00:06:39.720> gas<00:06:39.900> easy<00:06:40.200> I<00:06:41.090> think<00:06:42.090> so

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
of gas easy I think so

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.800 
of gas easy I think so
plus<00:06:43.410> if<00:06:43.800> it's<00:06:44.430> got<00:06:44.610> a<00:06:44.639> reserve<00:06:45.030> on<00:06:45.360> top<00:06:45.630> of

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
plus if it's got a reserve on top of

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.750 
plus if it's got a reserve on top of
that<00:06:45.900> so<00:06:46.139> I'm<00:06:46.289> thinking<00:06:46.740> that<00:06:46.919> altogether

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
that so I'm thinking that altogether
