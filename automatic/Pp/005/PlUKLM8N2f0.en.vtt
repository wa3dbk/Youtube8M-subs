00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:13.450
 the constitution and now what it says then we remember that sleep says that 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.100
 italy is a democratic republic based on work sovereignty 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.289
 it belongs to the people who exercise furniture min 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.560
 my limits of constitution atta mind says that power has it 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.039
 constitution 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.589
 is that the people can exercise according to what the constitution is 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.770
 win us in the new article of the new constitutional charter let's say another 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.350
 thing 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.750
 we say that the state as the sole purpose is to create the conditions 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.350
 best for the individual to express himself in society according to i 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.810
 own wishes 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.570
 and that the state fish from individual personal choices and is limited 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.640
 5 basic services that are the guarantee of public health 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.630
 there is the guarantee of the public school the guarantee of transport the guarantee 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.250
 of security and defense 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.140
 after this the individual citizen is responsible for his own cavity 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.400
 late and own desires of one's actions of what one wishes for oneself 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 and for those who 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.370
 eh buys is ubulibri tied 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.430
 the new constitution provides for the article 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.420
 this here immediately after article 17 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.050
 that every citizen is obliged if he wants to enjoy citizenship 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.259
 Italian and the opportunities associated with it to pay a fixed fee 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.560
 because it cannot be increased more than 15% based on the requirement 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.749
 state history 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.849
 so if today we propose 3000 euros 23,000 euros can never be 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.680
 above a figure that is 15% more 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.640
 finally the Italian raimon more with the south more all so worse 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.980
 together with absolutely no player adherence between those who pay 3000 euros in 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.049
 calabria who pays 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.710
 the 3000 euros in a street bar 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.710
 this means that there will be the same services that will be available in Lombardy 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.650
 also in Calabria 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.750
 This is a moment of great change this is a moment 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.579
 I would say of epochal changes 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.379
 challenge the thoughts of everyone to imagine and think that 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.169
 this is the right occasion the only great opportunity for a great 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.349
 change 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.549
 and great changes are those that are certain in the future within the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.999
 advice to look at the past we will not have the opportunity 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.710
 and it will open ref. us a chasm 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.819
 insurmountable that will make us all fall 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.579
 if we will have the courage to look beyond fact as at all a christopher 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.859
 Colombo asked to look into the future we will find a new country a country 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.130
 best a country 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.689
 that worries 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.810
 d trial satisfying and contributing to the satisfaction of everyone's desires 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.289
 what in the article 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.939
 in article r22 of the constitution in this regard 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.279
 precisely because I speak of monocracy his blood to the elected head of state 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.369
 up to 75 years old 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:16.119
 encompasses all three powers of the state, that is, the executive power the 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:21.579
 legislative power the judiciary and therefore will come - all assemblies 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.849
 also because we know that two people 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.099
 two spouses fight for much less 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.930
 think about how to get people to agree 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.239
 let go to a small town and then we will have instead the article 22 contemplated 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.489
 that the popular consultations will take place every 5 years for the election 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.999
 of the national popular college 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:48.369
 the national popular college will consist of 45 members elected by the people 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:50.320
 heatran an advisory character 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.769
 for the head of state, international internal policy guidelines 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.090
 at what time the head of the people elected by the people was now governed by the people 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.189
 up to 75 years perfect 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.249
 and we must not worry about the dictatorship is not that if the fault is not 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.279
 is that if there is democracy there is no dictatorship and if there is no 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.110
 democracy is dictatorship 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.840
 these are ancient past concert concepts 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.340
 a head of state in a state that must guarantee only 5 services 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.549
 you can't be the dictator of anything 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.009
 because the constitutional charter states that individuals are free to do so 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:25.969
 who wants 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.710
 in the state 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.009
 pay 3000 euros as long as you wait for the 25 articles of the constitution 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.639
 the problem does not exist because the head of state must also respect them
