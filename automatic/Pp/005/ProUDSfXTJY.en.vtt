impressive<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:04.520> all<00:02:05.520> right<00:02:05.700> let's<00:02:05.880> try

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
impressive I think all right let's try

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.250 
impressive I think all right let's try
this<00:02:06.090> again<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.630> time<00:02:06.690> we're<00:02:07.020> gonna<00:02:07.080> do

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
this again and this time we're gonna do

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.859 
this again and this time we're gonna do
it<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.560> real<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.980> time<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.640> care<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.539> care

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it for real this time we care we care

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.720 
it for real this time we care we care
enough<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> share<00:02:10.619> our<00:02:10.950> feelings<00:02:11.390> about<00:02:12.390> unwed

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
enough to share our feelings about unwed

enough to share our feelings about unwed
dictators<00:02:16.670> all<00:02:17.670> right<00:02:17.850> jumping<00:02:18.209> right<00:02:18.420> over

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
dictators all right jumping right over

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.650

that<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:19.100> whoo<00:02:20.130> all<00:02:20.580> right<00:02:20.730> slip<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.209> here

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
that one whoo all right slip off here

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.280 
that one whoo all right slip off here
that<00:02:21.870> looks<00:02:22.080> pretty<00:02:23.930> all<00:02:24.930> right<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
that looks pretty all right so the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.110 
that looks pretty all right so the
object<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.830> course<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> attack<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> can

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
object of course is to attack what I can

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.780 
object of course is to attack what I can
only<00:02:27.240> assume<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> an<00:02:28.350> egg-laying<00:02:29.220> device

also<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.980> aware<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.160> some<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.610> platforms

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
also be aware that some of the platforms

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.810 
also be aware that some of the platforms
are<00:02:36.480> spikes<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.290> staying<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> platform's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
are spikes and staying on the platform's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.310 
are spikes and staying on the platform's
too<00:02:38.910> long<00:02:39.090> will<00:02:39.330> lead<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.570> into<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.780> wall<00:02:39.989> of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.500 
too long will lead you into a wall of
spikes<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.520> chances<00:02:41.910> are<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.150> thinking

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
spikes so chances are I'm thinking

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.699 
spikes so chances are I'm thinking

too<00:03:03.900> bad<00:03:04.049> all<00:03:04.920> right<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.130> I'm<00:03:05.190> seeing<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.459> lot<00:03:05.580> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
too bad all right so I'm seeing a lot of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.920 
too bad all right so I'm seeing a lot of
swirls<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.280> yeah<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.720> about

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
swirls here and yeah it's not about

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.150 
swirls here and yeah it's not about
actually<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.380> think<00:03:10.500> I'm<00:03:10.560> gonna<00:03:10.650> backtrack<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
actually I think I'm gonna backtrack a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.690 
actually I think I'm gonna backtrack a
little<00:03:11.250> bit

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
little bit

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.759 
little bit
because<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.720> feel<00:03:13.049> as<00:03:13.350> though<00:03:13.380> there<00:03:13.680> may<00:03:13.739> be

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
because I feel as though there may be

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.970 
because I feel as though there may be
something<00:03:14.100> ah<00:03:14.540> yes<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.140> there<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> point<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
something ah yes so there is a point to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
something ah yes so there is a point to
all<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:18.620> well<00:03:19.620> now<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.769> know<00:03:19.830> what

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
all of this well now you know what

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.229 
all of this well now you know what
happens<00:03:20.220> when<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.400> backtrack<00:03:20.730> after<00:03:21.030> seeing

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
happens when you backtrack after seeing

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.900 
happens when you backtrack after seeing
swirls<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.830> because<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.280> extra<00:03:23.580> ammo

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
swirls do that because the extra ammo

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.479 
swirls do that because the extra ammo
can<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.570> will<00:03:24.690> be<00:03:24.810> quite<00:03:24.989> helpful<00:03:25.340> for<00:03:26.340> what's

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
can and will be quite helpful for what's

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:26.920
