00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.500
 which moved forward so long continues 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.920
 us that we are just a confectioner a game 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 and who else she almost did that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:08.330
 He has no word for almost ten months 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.190
 May come myself over a few gates 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.870
 also did not know that we were in the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.950
 second half the opponent easy 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:20.000
 then it will be successful in the game 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:28.460
 can only do two choices 1 or 5 1 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.670
 play in a few benjamin piles 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.009
 suddenly we all have to watch that 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.869
 we are as strong as it is somehow possible 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.290
 i keep to folder as fast as it does 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.610
 is also coming back or was 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.500
 act on it but mechanics is today 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.490
 on it I've never seen the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.490
 action 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:08.130
 discovered that no matching from outside 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.130
 must be the next overpower of Neuhausen 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.300
 end fits right from right to ninth 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.810
 in the square the corpses came again 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.670
 go try negative is different we 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.520
 out there we just have to go from the back 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:28.330
 tenants in four years three against three 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.200
 situations on the side have this 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.690
 and only one against one situations 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 the side of the middle march you here 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.320
 from the outside position this only 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:45.160
 Just make doubt here 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.140
 haye before back before he really against 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.170
 circular and throughout her already certain 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.210
 to edit and everyone twitter trend 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.310
 to the situations capable and space lie 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.250
 right and then fall in training 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.750
 first watch the father against 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.850
 which must attract our outside left 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.209
 markus body contact against outside right 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.340
 plays a c youth related but 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.020
 No one does not recognize the body either 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.380
 shall, in the 260 but has for example 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.970
 to prevent that human making 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.260
 even by really good we judge 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.130
 our trips should close 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.290
 The coach will worry about absolute 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.570
 already at the circle he will not work 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.489
 without ball it just has to be in the mountains 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.950
 circumvent nature he has in the circle 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.040
 boxed wendecover be edited 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.230
 he should have a bed in dearborn 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.769
 and we leave behind great this 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.769
 are funny 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:04:00.410
 these are sexy as a saint 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.360
 cut off the path more offset more 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.569
 has me standing that is sympathetic and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:11.840
 he would be a first problem that we 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:15.739
 always the same as they have been since I am 3 today 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.190
 Process 1 and 5 1 up to 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.560
 to the absolute pain threshold again and again 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.430
 always back out boxing always 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.430
 to deal with again 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:36.760
 Both systems then more courage to the game 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.760
 tackle the tempo game forward 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.139
 others many very good or evil 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.710
 fourth shot probably has the hand under hast 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.169
 hand like high power motion in front of 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.570
 ball acceptance that you always the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.289
 interruption but certainly 506 substance 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.849
 Wood with you is too much monument to new 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.830
 formally still a bit what is right 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.770
 for my games where you once the 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.830
 Missing assignment and think that there 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.460
 Looking for more out there , you always travel 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.490
 to set falk back is from the outside was 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.330
 45 still has three against one against a circle 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.430
 in us by outside courage to and 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.740
 therefore the existing external constituencies 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.660
 I have to work for work 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.300
 foul without choice you have less 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.789
 it can not be that it is in the game 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.849
 home match we have a time penalty 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.680
 opponent 3 you just travel at five 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.220
 ten percent more they go more 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.220
 where it hurts 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.090
 Roleplayers of life almost do that 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.860
 Half our time, but I have to 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.169
 time again write 1 2 of you 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:56.029
 come and no more distance that because 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:06:00.400
 even more coming to travel is tactics 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:02.090
 13 10 751 and number ten minutes 3 3 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.090
 7 and 3 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.249
 where past and present on the day here really 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.460
 his best original our first order 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.460
 him
