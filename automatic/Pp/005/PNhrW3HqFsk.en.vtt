00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 basically it's done through the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.799
 browser browser by default with 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.109

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 there are other options you want to do it to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 through another browser that is the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 chrome on the street that does not work 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.210
 we are here to the browser we started to 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.470
 google booth on google 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.470
 we click on images 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.890
 we see that in images 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.350
 and being in images simply 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.600
 we write wallpapers according to 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.430
 theme we want for example we can 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.430
 write backgrounds 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.480
 wallpapers 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.570
 screen 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.850
 and cars 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.490
 let's go find 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 since several images appeared 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.229
 basically with the campus is an image 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.580
 here looking for the one we like the most 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.240
 we click on the shelves 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.490
 like for any image and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.259
 entering any image we can 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.660
 navigate through them to the 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.530
 sides 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.080
 let's find the one we like the most 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.670
 we wait for him to fully charge us 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.410
 we will realize that there will be as charged 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.480
 completely in the resolution of the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 image here below tells us that it is 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.180
 thousand two thousand 280 x 960 and to download it 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.460
 we just click here on 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.590
 image and because there appear many 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.350
 options see image copy image and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.970
 define wallpaper in this case 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.040
 we can give you immediately to define 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.450
 like when I screen with save the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.760
 image as to have it our 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.260
 collection of images and keep changing the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.820
 wallpaper every time we want 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.940
 let's download this other 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.580
 save Picture 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.580
 and we are going to use here in a fraction 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.710
 to define as wallpaper to see 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.480
 How about that here I came out after three 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.730
 options that asks me if you want that 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 be as much as home screen no more 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.880
 that a blocking screen or as a start 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.070
 See blockade beginning to see 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.569
 that the band already blocking that they do 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.600
 changes 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.750
 let's perform accept 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.890
 and let's go here he's going to come out he does not know 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.430
 any change you made about the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.430
 start screen 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.990
 to the Andeans completely as they will see 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.060
 it was already defined as the image of 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.980
 wallpaper however the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.250
 resolution of the image that you put is not 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.620
 so good did not use as the image 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.660
 original so it's better to download the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.970
 image because the screen alcohol 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.080
 a lot with the image with higher resolution 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.080
 much sharper 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.590
 more coming out of here not only that changed 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.560
 both screens what starts did not change 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.660
 only the blockade as I suggested him another 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.319
 way to download is through another 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.580
 browser either the chrome the firefox 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.310
 let's do it through firefox 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.560
 we are at firefox and in the same way 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.250
 simply what we do is use 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.250
 first google 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.600
 both google was google being in 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.500
 google google and go to 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.540
