00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
consistently and and so our brain

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.259 
consistently and and so our brain
actually<00:00:26.519> goes<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:26.970> got<00:00:27.090> these<00:00:27.210> things

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
actually goes there we got these things

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.509 
actually goes there we got these things
called<00:00:27.660> neuro<00:00:28.080> pathways<00:00:28.380> which<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.369> just

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
called neuro pathways which are just

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.780 
called neuro pathways which are just
like<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:29.849> simply<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.740> like

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
like really simply just like like

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.280 
like really simply just like like
emotional<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> thought<00:00:33.540> connections<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.170> our

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
emotional and thought connections in our

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.130 
emotional and thought connections in our
mind<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.940> physical<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.059> well<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.930> it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
mind and physical as well and and it's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.209 
mind and physical as well and and it's
like<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> more<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.800> something<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.100> more

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
like the more you do something the more

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
like the more you do something the more
that<00:00:38.430> gets<00:00:38.579> stronger<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.600> feel

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that gets stronger so the more you feel

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.450 
that gets stronger so the more you feel
a<00:00:39.809> negative<00:00:40.200> emotion<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.100> emotion

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
a negative emotion the more that emotion

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.500 
a negative emotion the more that emotion
gets<00:00:41.579> stronger<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> more<00:00:42.270> your<00:00:42.390> brain

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
gets stronger and the more your brain

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.330 
gets stronger and the more your brain
naturally<00:00:42.840> goes<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:44.219> how

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
naturally goes there because of how

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
naturally goes there because of how
strong<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.789> connection<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
strong that connection is so we want to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.420 
strong that connection is so we want to
do<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.920> create<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.489> strong<00:00:48.020> positive

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
do is create really strong positive

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.350 
do is create really strong positive
emotions<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> our<00:00:50.640> mind<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> our<00:00:51.030> brain<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
emotions in our mind in our brain and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.520 
emotions in our mind in our brain and
the<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the way you do that is you got to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
the way you do that is you got to
condition<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.969> I'm<00:00:54.300> gonna<00:00:54.449> share

do it with what you're thinking about
right<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> take<00:01:26.970> control<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
right and so we want to take control of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
right and so we want to take control of
conscious<00:01:27.900> control<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> process<00:01:28.470> instead

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
conscious control that process instead

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.670 
conscious control that process instead
of<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.490> letting<00:01:29.850> our<00:01:30.210> being<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> reaction<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of just letting our being a reaction and

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.469 
of just letting our being a reaction and
getting<00:01:32.009> controlled<00:01:32.460> by<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> events<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.360> our

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
getting controlled by the events or our

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.969 
getting controlled by the events or our
environment<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> stuff<00:01:34.229> around<00:01:34.380> us<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
environment or the stuff around us and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
environment or the stuff around us and
how<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.509> similar<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
how you do that is this is similar to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
how you do that is this is similar to
the<00:01:37.470> morning<00:01:37.740> ritual<00:01:38.100> video<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> talked

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the morning ritual video that we talked

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.510 
the morning ritual video that we talked
about<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.750> awhile<00:01:39.900> ago<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.340> how<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.400> do

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
about it like awhile ago but how you do

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.620 
about it like awhile ago but how you do
that<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> develop<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.329> bit<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that is you develop a little bit of a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.120 
that is you develop a little bit of a
daily<00:01:42.899> practice<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> same<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.920> as

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
daily practice that's the same way as

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.740 
daily practice that's the same way as
like<00:01:44.520> working<00:01:44.939> out<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.390> working<00:01:45.630> out

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
like working out but you're working out

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.679 
like working out but you're working out
your<00:01:45.899> emotions<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.299> might<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
your emotions and and you might want to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
your emotions and and you might want to
do<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.320> place<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:49.829> there's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
do this in a place where there's not a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
do this in a place where there's not a
ton<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> people<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.869> room<00:01:52.140> or
