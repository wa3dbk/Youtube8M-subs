00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.680
 mod idea of ​​me today's about 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.010
 classics of agriculture that there is a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.080
 official mod from the side so 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 actually an addon and the whole thing is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 I'll get you this in for free now 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 show this video there are each 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.210
 a lot of new times that actually a lot 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.289
 are designed in detail and also a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.150
 Nice cockpit we can now with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.350
 a self-loading wagon of course, too 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.079
 a vintage grass and straw collecting 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.260
 The loading wagon has a volume of just under ten 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260
 metric tons 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 Alternatively we can, of course 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
 baling the bales are relative 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.649
 small and have a volume of 330 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.649
 units 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.070
 We can load the bales 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.570
 use a self-loading wagon 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.379
 it can actually be done with this 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.839
 the bales work pretty fast 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.680
 we can then sell or to the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.680
 bring clean 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.340
 Alternatively, you can do it quite naturally 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.250
 even with a befitsgemäßen rolls 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.810
 do with front loader myself personally 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.670
 I do not realize that at all 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.649
 but there is a possibility as well 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.299
 can one on this front loader also one 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.280
 shovel attachment for example the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.020
 bgr to shovel even if that 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 Probably takes many many days 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.600
 there is also a 2 hit with boards 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.609
 that's fair enough 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.289
 work work pretty slow 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.659
 Of course, this is not true for Reuter Mann either 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.849
 just as important here right now 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.860
 this Schlüter is in the picture of the shoulder 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.079
 actually thus the best of the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 Old timers who drive really well 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.860
 leaves almost like a big one 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.170
 if a fly can take too long 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.629
 Alternatively, of course, to sample as well 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.479
 with a nice old device and he is 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.310
 just 25 meters wide but that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.680
 is not that bad because 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 you with reuter with not necessarily 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.400
 The goal is to work so fast 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.660
 but of course a whole piece 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.660
 faster than the flight 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.940
 a seeder is also doing that 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.130
 special about this seeder is that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.260
 Although it is relatively narrow in comparison 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.450
 to other machines but they can each 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.330
 really every type of fruit also corn 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.190
 turnip potatoes and everything the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.870
 other machines can not do so 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.050
 It's usually like that either 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.890
 a machine gives corn for potatoes 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.870
 and turnips 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.770
 because one for the other varieties no 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.770
 this one can really do everything 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.750
 besides, there is a side 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.580
 masonry with which you can also smaller 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.110
 Editing grassy areas can be so great 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.000
 fields that is probably not too 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.740
 recommend but in a small style 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.740
 not so bad at all 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:16.360
 then we can turn and 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.360
 after that swan 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 who a fan of a rake 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.810
 potato harvest was or is can now 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.930
 also harvest a rich corn and that with 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.750
 this beautiful a series model in ran 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.640
 you can hang a trailer 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.640
 and then you get the shredded material in 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.470
 Unfortunately , I was able to give you this machine 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.500
 Do not show that she is a caregiver 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.930
 the brand crown that the effort because 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.760
 just a little too big 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.280
 to show that now I hope that 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.530
 It does not matter that they are 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.810
 Two kegs once a keg that 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.690
 Made of metal and his life is one 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.769
 wooden barrel for manure of orange honest 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.120
 said already pretty much looks like the day 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.810
 I almost forgot, of course 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.640
 we can do that too 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.450
 I really like this add-on 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.150
 finally a bit 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.910
 change with the beautiful ones 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.859
 old machines and I think it has 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.650
 worth it to download the right 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.510
 I would recommend it to anyone 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.860
 does that is a nice thing link 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.729
 is in the description the whole is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.060
 free 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.370
 and if you do it all again 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.350
 then want to look somewhere in video form 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.270
 i know a let's play from that 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.430
 I have linked this caravan here 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.710
 there could even stop by the 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.490
 machine then already tested a little league 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.020
 as I did that, it was actually thank you 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.020
 for watching and bye
