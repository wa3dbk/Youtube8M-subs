it's<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.950> put<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's right you put it on like this and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.679 
it's right you put it on like this and
it<00:02:03.719> always<00:02:03.840> reminds<00:02:04.320> me<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:05.570> messing<00:02:06.570> around

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.710 
with an inner tube for a bicycle
it's<00:02:10.280> hard<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.520> do<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.910> with<00:02:11.210> one<00:02:11.390> hand<00:02:13.720> but

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it's hard to do this with one hand but

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.190 
it's hard to do this with one hand but
here<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.260> go<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:19.160> started<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.840> like

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that William bit of wiggle and this is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.570 
that William bit of wiggle and this is
what<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.680> looks<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.070> with<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:27.580> backing

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
what it looks like with just the backing

the<00:02:28.760> sleeve<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:30.050> we<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.410> this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the sleeve on and then we have this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the sleeve on and then we have this
other<00:02:30.910> piece<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:31.940> acts<00:02:32.450> as<00:02:32.630> even<00:02:32.930> more

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
other piece that acts as even more

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
other piece that acts as even more
protection<00:02:34.640> it's<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.090> hard<00:02:35.510> plastic<00:02:35.780> piece

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
any damage to my device the notes to is

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.180 
any damage to my device the notes to is

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
definitely not inexpensive and i'm not i

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.180 
definitely not inexpensive and i'm not i
don't<00:03:49.310> think<00:03:49.610> this<00:03:49.730> is<00:03:49.810> metal<00:03:50.810> fits<00:03:51.560> sounds

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
don't think this is metal fits sounds

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.920 
don't think this is metal fits sounds
like<00:03:52.280> metal<00:03:52.489> but<00:03:52.640> i<00:03:53.030> think<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:53.600> some

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
like metal but i think this is just some

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.009 
like metal but i think this is just some
kind<00:03:54.140> of<00:03:54.260> plastic<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:55.070> i<00:03:55.310> see<00:03:55.670> how<00:03:55.820> it<00:03:55.850> holds

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
kind of plastic but i see how it holds

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.380 
kind of plastic but i see how it holds
yeah<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.590> yeah<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.280> can<00:03:58.430> see<00:03:58.580> like<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:58.790> you're

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
yeah so yeah you can see like if you're

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.830 
yeah so yeah you can see like if you're
down<00:03:59.600> here<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.200> fine<00:04:00.860> but<00:04:01.790> couple<00:04:02.450> presses<00:04:02.810> up

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
down here is fine but couple presses up

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.370 
down here is fine but couple presses up
here<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.790> yeah<00:04:04.790> but<00:04:05.600> you<00:04:05.780> know<00:04:05.900> that's<00:04:06.200> not<00:04:06.320> a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
here and yeah but you know that's not a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.410 
here and yeah but you know that's not a
big<00:04:06.530> big<00:04:06.920> deal<00:04:07.130> when<00:04:07.700> i<00:04:07.760> watch<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.120> movie<00:04:08.390> or
