00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.710
 my husband 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 and therefore we seek help either 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.110
 to institutions and to the mayor 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.159
 francesco spina and citizenship of 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.070
 bisceglie 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.950
 we ask for help but not for us but 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.909
 especially for our two children who 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.680
 we have because they are suffering and 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.360
 psychologically they look good and 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.030
 let's say that more than a year than me 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 unfortunately I was fired for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:49.060
 company reasons and now I'm in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.960
 this situation is quite critical 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.110
 let's say I'm trying to find a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.110
 work 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.899
 let's hope someone could 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.920
 help we got the first one 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.320

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 unfortunately where to put the furniture 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.849
 so let's say we had others 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.459
 three days of being able to find 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.830

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.100
 it is for them they managed to find the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.709
 accommodation 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.290
 but my wife and I sleep in the car 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.569

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.970
 find space even if unsure certainties 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.340
 with the approach of darkness everything falters 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.810
 and labile certainties give way 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.410
 unknown 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.530

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:43.740
 at least to settle down for a while so that 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:47.370
 we can say how to find a 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.620
 work place whatever it is 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.660
 we are willing to do anything also a 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.850
 work whatever work this is the 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.690
 We are not looking for a solution 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.790
 we are not looking for anything else now 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.050
 silver and look for a job 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.120
 housing is a help more than anything else 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.990
 emanuela and giampiero in their 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.660
 understandable discouragement not 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.850
 they beg not to beg, if anything, they seek 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.010
 answers and it doesn't even matter from 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.200
 who will eventually reach this 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.450
 what matters is that they lead to that 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.400
 serenity that these two parents and theirs 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.400
 two children have lost about a year
