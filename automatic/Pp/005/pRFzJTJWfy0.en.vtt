00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.199 
not considered part of the block so you
can<00:02:34.230> end<00:02:34.439> up<00:02:34.590> seeing<00:02:34.829> right<00:02:35.189> through<00:02:35.639> it<00:02:35.790> see

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
if I look right here at this one part of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.190 
if I look right here at this one part of
the<00:02:39.239> block<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.599> could<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.870> right<00:02:39.900> through<00:02:40.049> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the block I could see right through it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.110 
the block I could see right through it
and<00:02:40.409> I<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:40.829> place<00:02:41.219> blocks<00:02:41.579> through

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and I can actually place blocks through

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.089 
and I can actually place blocks through
it<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.689> see<00:02:43.019> I'm<00:02:43.349> placing<00:02:43.799> blocks

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
it like this see I'm placing blocks

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.550 
it like this see I'm placing blocks
right<00:02:44.489> through<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.209> not<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:46.019> right<00:02:46.230> there

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
right through it not there right there

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.319 
right through it not there right there
there<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.859> go<00:02:46.919> so<00:02:47.549> that's<00:02:47.669> how<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:47.970> works<00:02:48.150> guys

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
there we go so that's how it works guys

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.789 
there we go so that's how it works guys
that's<00:02:48.870> why<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.049> say<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.409> best<00:02:49.560> thing

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
that's why I say it's the best thing

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.800 
that's why I say it's the best thing
ever<00:02:49.919> because<00:02:50.129> literally<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.939> that<00:02:51.359> small

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
ever because literally it's that small

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
you know let's use a different color

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.149 
you know let's use a different color
just<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.480> make<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:00.959> stand<00:03:01.290> out<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> bit<00:03:01.680> over

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
just to make it stand out a bit over

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.190

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
let's choose quartz I like using quartz

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.379 
let's choose quartz I like using quartz
so<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.519> have<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.669> do<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.849> put<00:03:08.969> one<00:03:09.090> stair<00:03:09.269> like

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
so we have to do is put one stair like

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.520 
so we have to do is put one stair like
that<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.629> then<00:03:09.719> put<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.900> other<00:03:09.930> stair<00:03:10.260> turn

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
that and then put the other stair turn

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.649 
that and then put the other stair turn
this<00:03:10.859> way<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.609> let's<00:03:11.879> say<00:03:11.969> I<00:03:12.030> want<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.269> lever<00:03:12.480> on

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
this way so let's say I want a lever on

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.849 
this way so let's say I want a lever on
this<00:03:12.810> side<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.139> like<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.319> put<00:03:13.469> I<00:03:13.500> put<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.709> block

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
this side so like I put I put a block

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.670 
this side so like I put I put a block
right<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.099> let's<00:03:14.549> take<00:03:15.030> out<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> lever<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.590> now

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
right here let's take out a lever so now

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.439 
right here let's take out a lever so now
I<00:03:16.709> got<00:03:16.889> a<00:03:16.919> lever<00:03:17.159> on<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.459> side<00:03:17.699> so<00:03:18.180> if<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.299> go

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449

over here and I look right through the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.259 
over here and I look right through the
block<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:20.250> could<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.549> with<00:03:20.699> any<00:03:20.819> stair<00:03:21.150> -

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269

room on this side so what I do is I just

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.390 
room on this side so what I do is I just
go<00:04:07.290> like<00:04:07.409> this<00:04:07.530> two<00:04:07.709> blocks<00:04:07.919> up<00:04:08.099> one<00:04:08.250> block

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
go like this two blocks up one block

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.030 
go like this two blocks up one block
down<00:04:08.430> two<00:04:09.120> blocks<00:04:09.239> up<00:04:09.569> take<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.290> rail<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.949> a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
down two blocks up take a rail and a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.659 
down two blocks up take a rail and a
minecart

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
minecart

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.240 
minecart
put<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.239> rail<00:04:12.509> here<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.930> minecart<00:04:13.739> here<00:04:13.979> and<00:04:14.129> then

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
put a rail here a minecart here and then

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.229 
put a rail here a minecart here and then
just<00:04:14.400> get<00:04:14.549> inside<00:04:14.699> the<00:04:14.819> minecart<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.120> can

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
just get inside the minecart you can

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.969 
just get inside the minecart you can
also<00:04:15.389> do<00:04:15.659> this<00:04:15.810> with<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.019> boat<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.859> don't

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
also do this with a boat so if you don't

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.229 
also do this with a boat so if you don't
want<00:04:17.099> to<00:04:17.159> waste<00:04:17.250> too<00:04:17.430> many<00:04:17.579> resources<00:04:17.909> on

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
want to waste too many resources on

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.509 
want to waste too many resources on
making<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.799> minecart<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.190> want<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.400> make<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
making a minecart and you want to make a

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.860 
making a minecart and you want to make a
boat<00:04:20.759> instead<00:04:21.000> actually<00:04:21.359> let<00:04:21.599> me<00:04:21.659> do<00:04:21.750> this

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
boat instead actually let me do this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.629 
boat instead actually let me do this
area<00:04:22.109> if<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.800> want<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.979> make<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.099> boat<00:04:23.370> instead

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
area if you want to make a boat instead

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.399 
area if you want to make a boat instead
of<00:04:24.029> a<00:04:24.330> my<00:04:24.510> card<00:04:24.779> to<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.050> waste<00:04:25.229> as<00:04:25.380> much

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
of a my card to not waste as much

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.920 
of a my card to not waste as much
resources<00:04:25.860> go<00:04:26.190> right<00:04:26.400> ahead<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.610> could

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
resources go right ahead you could

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.920 
resources go right ahead you could
with<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.169> boat<00:04:27.910> now<00:04:28.910> with<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:29.330> one<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:29.690> one's

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
with a boat now with this one this one's

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.629 
with a boat now with this one this one's
a<00:04:30.020> little<00:04:30.169> bit<00:04:30.289> different<00:04:30.740> right<00:04:30.800> here<00:04:31.130> as<00:04:31.250> you

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
a little bit different right here as you

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.610 
a little bit different right here as you
can<00:04:31.789> see<00:04:31.940> what<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.479> is<00:04:32.900> actually<00:04:33.110> it

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
can see what it is is actually it

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.200 
can see what it is is actually it
updates<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.250> piston<00:04:34.669> under<00:04:34.850> here<00:04:35.000> with<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
updates a piston under here with a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.070 
updates a piston under here with a
redstone<00:04:35.419> torch

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
redstone torch

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.080 
redstone torch
thus<00:04:36.410> activating<00:04:37.009> this<00:04:37.130> making<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.669> monostable

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
thus activating this making a monostable

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.029 
thus activating this making a monostable
circuit<00:04:38.810> so<00:04:39.199> now<00:04:39.289> let<00:04:39.440> me<00:04:39.470> show<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.680> how<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.919> do

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
circuit so now let me show you how to do

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.320 
circuit so now let me show you how to do
that<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.340> we'll<00:04:40.610> build<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.910> on<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.090> outside

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
that so we'll build it on the outside

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.360 
that so we'll build it on the outside
and<00:04:41.479> then<00:04:41.600> we'll<00:04:41.720> go<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.080> this<00:04:42.410> around<00:04:42.710> it<00:04:42.919> so

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and then we'll go the this around it so

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.300 
and then we'll go the this around it so
we<00:04:43.910> need<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.720> repeater<00:04:45.229> and<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.710> sticky<00:04:46.130> piston

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
we need a repeater and a sticky piston

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.430 
we need a repeater and a sticky piston
so<00:04:46.669> let's<00:04:47.030> take<00:04:47.210> out<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.479> repeater<00:04:47.990> we<00:04:48.139> need<00:04:48.289> one

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
so let's take out a repeater we need one

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.680 
so let's take out a repeater we need one
repeater<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.940> we're<00:04:50.150> also<00:04:50.270> going<00:04:50.509> to<00:04:50.600> need

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
repeater and we're also going to need

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.980 
repeater and we're also going to need
one<00:04:50.990> sticky<00:04:51.770> piston<00:04:52.160> like<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.360> so<00:04:53.810> what<00:04:53.900> you

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
one sticky piston like that so what you

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.969 
one sticky piston like that so what you
want<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.229> do<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.440> pretty<00:04:54.590> much<00:04:54.650> just<00:04:54.800> dig<00:04:54.949> down

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
want to do is pretty much just dig down

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.800 
want to do is pretty much just dig down
one<00:04:55.280> put<00:04:55.430> your<00:04:55.550> sticky<00:04:55.820> piston<00:04:56.120> here<00:04:56.270> put<00:04:56.780> a

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
one put your sticky piston here put a

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.540 
one put your sticky piston here put a
block<00:04:57.110> above<00:04:57.470> your<00:04:57.650> sticky<00:04:57.889> piston<00:04:58.250> two

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
block above your sticky piston two

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.730 
block above your sticky piston two
blocks<00:04:58.820> up<00:04:59.030> delete<00:04:59.509> this<00:04:59.690> block<00:04:59.840> actually<00:05:00.560> put

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
blocks up delete this block actually put

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.170 
blocks up delete this block actually put
a<00:05:00.770> block<00:05:00.919> to<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.160> left<00:05:01.310> as<00:05:01.430> well<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:02.060> it's

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
a block to the left as well so it's

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.670 
a block to the left as well so it's
right<00:05:02.360> like<00:05:02.539> this<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:02.900> now<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.139> I<00:05:03.199> put<00:05:03.349> my<00:05:03.440> torch

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
right like this so now if I put my torch

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.010 
right like this so now if I put my torch
here<00:05:03.949> it<00:05:04.250> updates<00:05:04.759> the<00:05:04.849> piston<00:05:05.270> see<00:05:05.900> it's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
here it updates the piston see it's

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.779 
here it updates the piston see it's
updating<00:05:06.349> that<00:05:06.470> piston<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.099> then<00:05:07.430> all<00:05:07.550> we<00:05:07.669> do

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
updating that piston and then all we do

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.189 
updating that piston and then all we do
is<00:05:07.880> put<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.030> repeater<00:05:08.419> coming<00:05:08.750> out<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:09.080> this

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
is put a repeater coming out of this

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.300 
is put a repeater coming out of this
blocks<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.680> want<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:09.889> put<00:05:10.009> a<00:05:10.039> torch<00:05:10.280> here

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
blocks and I want to put a torch here

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.659 
blocks and I want to put a torch here
that<00:05:11.180> repeater<00:05:11.599> gets<00:05:11.840> updated<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:12.770> it's

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
that repeater gets updated and it's

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.400 
that repeater gets updated and it's
getting<00:05:13.910> updated<00:05:14.270> by<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.389> half<00:05:14.750> a<00:05:14.870> tick<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.289> now

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
getting updated by a half a tick so now

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.749 
getting updated by a half a tick so now
since<00:05:15.620> it's<00:05:15.770> getting<00:05:15.860> updated<00:05:16.250> by<00:05:16.430> half<00:05:16.610> a

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
since it's getting updated by half a

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.279 
since it's getting updated by half a
tick<00:05:16.940> we<00:05:17.060> could<00:05:17.210> put<00:05:17.389> literally<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.810> sticky

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
tick we could put literally a sticky

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.469 
tick we could put literally a sticky
piston<00:05:18.440> right<00:05:18.740> here<00:05:18.919> with<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.520> block<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.240> we

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
piston right here with a block and we

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.689 
piston right here with a block and we
can<00:05:20.599> create<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:20.960> model<00:05:21.349> tables<00:05:21.650> it's<00:05:22.430> pretty

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
can create a model tables it's pretty

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.249 
can create a model tables it's pretty
much<00:05:22.789> just<00:05:22.849> a<00:05:23.030> model<00:05:23.270> saleable<00:05:23.509> circuit<00:05:23.840> there

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
much just a model saleable circuit there

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.200 
much just a model saleable circuit there
you<00:05:24.349> go<00:05:24.410> well<00:05:25.310> if<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.550> put<00:05:25.699> like<00:05:25.880> it<00:05:26.000> like<00:05:26.150> I

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
you go well if you put like it like I

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.999 
you go well if you put like it like I
said<00:05:26.270> if<00:05:26.449> what<00:05:26.960> I<00:05:26.990> did<00:05:27.169> over<00:05:27.349> here<00:05:27.410> was<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.860> put

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
said if what I did over here was I put

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.409 
said if what I did over here was I put
it<00:05:28.099> upside<00:05:28.310> down<00:05:28.460> right<00:05:28.490> above<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:28.940> torch<00:05:29.240> and

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
it upside down right above a torch and

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.330 
it upside down right above a torch and
it<00:05:29.720> just<00:05:29.930> activates<00:05:30.440> that<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:31.099> how<00:05:31.280> you

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
it just activates that so how you

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.920 
it just activates that so how you
activate<00:05:31.789> it<00:05:32.060> through<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.330> wall<00:05:32.510> this<00:05:32.659> is<00:05:32.720> how

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
activate it through the wall this is how

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.570 
activate it through the wall this is how
you<00:05:32.990> activate<00:05:33.320> through<00:05:33.620> wall<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:33.919> pretty<00:05:34.460> much

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
you activate through wall so pretty much

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.460 
you activate through wall so pretty much
it's<00:05:34.729> just<00:05:34.909> a<00:05:35.030> decoy<00:05:35.419> your<00:05:35.750> chest<00:05:36.080> in<00:05:36.229> here<00:05:36.260> is

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
it's just a decoy your chest in here is

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.960 
it's just a decoy your chest in here is
a<00:05:36.500> decoy<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.010> if<00:05:37.099> your<00:05:37.220> friend<00:05:37.400> knows<00:05:37.610> like

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
a decoy so if your friend knows like

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.460 
a decoy so if your friend knows like
he'll<00:05:38.180> go<00:05:38.300> through<00:05:38.330> your<00:05:38.570> wall<00:05:38.750> thinking<00:05:39.199> okay

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
he'll go through your wall thinking okay

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.170 
he'll go through your wall thinking okay
that's<00:05:39.710> what's<00:05:39.919> back<00:05:40.130> there<00:05:40.159> that<00:05:40.490> chest<00:05:40.789> but

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
that's what's back there that chest but

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.000 
that's what's back there that chest but
that's<00:05:41.330> just<00:05:41.570> your<00:05:41.780> decoy<00:05:42.289> so<00:05:42.620> like<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:42.889> know

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
that's just your decoy so like you know

you go through here you go through the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.060 
you go through here you go through the
chest<00:05:44.720> like<00:05:44.840> oh<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:44.990> found<00:05:45.320> your<00:05:45.409> secret<00:05:45.680> chest

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
chest like oh I found your secret chest

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.290 
chest like oh I found your secret chest
and<00:05:46.340> maybe<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.669> put<00:05:46.820> dirt<00:05:47.000> in<00:05:47.090> there<00:05:47.210> it's

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
and maybe you put dirt in there it's

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.370 
and maybe you put dirt in there it's
like<00:05:47.389> all<00:05:47.510> it's<00:05:47.630> also<00:05:47.750> secret<00:05:48.110> sensors

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
like all it's also secret sensors

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.350 
like all it's also secret sensors
dirtier<00:05:48.650> or<00:05:49.010> if<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.340> look<00:05:49.520> up<00:05:49.760> right<00:05:50.120> at<00:05:50.240> the

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
dirtier or if we look up right at the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.149 
dirtier or if we look up right at the
top<00:05:50.539> of<00:05:50.570> this<00:05:50.750> block<00:05:50.960> since<00:05:51.680> there's<00:05:51.830> no<00:05:51.979> other

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
top of this block since there's no other

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.980 
top of this block since there's no other
blocks<00:05:52.490> around<00:05:52.669> it<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.180> put<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.479> torch<00:05:53.690> onto

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
blocks around it to put the torch onto

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.390 
blocks around it to put the torch onto
it<00:05:54.080> it'll<00:05:54.320> automatically<00:05:54.800> stick<00:05:55.190> to<00:05:55.310> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
it it'll automatically stick to the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.680 
it it'll automatically stick to the
bottom<00:05:55.550> block<00:05:55.729> because<00:05:55.940> torches<00:05:56.300> cannot<00:05:56.599> go

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
bottom block because torches cannot go

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.490 
bottom block because torches cannot go
on<00:05:56.750> chests<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.169> torches<00:05:57.919> cannot<00:05:58.310> go<00:05:58.820> on<00:05:59.060> of

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
on chests and torches cannot go on of

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.560 
on chests and torches cannot go on of
stairs<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:00.919> it<00:06:01.250> will<00:06:01.370> automatically<00:06:02.000> stick<00:06:02.419> to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
stairs so it will automatically stick to

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.210 
stairs so it will automatically stick to
this<00:06:02.690> bottom<00:06:03.050> block<00:06:03.229> so<00:06:03.500> we<00:06:03.620> go<00:06:03.710> just<00:06:03.919> look<00:06:04.070> up

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
this bottom block so we go just look up

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.580 
this bottom block so we go just look up
like<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:05.060> then<00:06:05.720> we<00:06:05.870> put<00:06:06.259> it<00:06:06.349> in<00:06:06.440> there

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
like this and then we put it in there

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.800 
like this and then we put it in there
okay<00:06:07.570> there<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:08.690> is<00:06:08.750> safe<00:06:08.990> it<00:06:09.349> activated

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
okay there it is safe it activated

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.700 
okay there it is safe it activated
and<00:06:11.810> then<00:06:11.930> of<00:06:12.020> course<00:06:12.230> when<00:06:12.380> you<00:06:12.440> go<00:06:12.530> on<00:06:12.620> the

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
and then of course when you go on the

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.020 
and then of course when you go on the
inside<00:06:13.040> of<00:06:13.190> your<00:06:13.280> secret<00:06:13.610> door<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:13.910> can

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
inside of your secret door you can

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.310 
inside of your secret door you can
always<00:06:14.180> have<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.360> so<00:06:14.570> you<00:06:14.630> go<00:06:14.840> collect<00:06:15.140> your

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
always have it so you go collect your

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.930 
always have it so you go collect your
torches<00:06:15.710> and<00:06:15.830> everything<00:06:16.220> from<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> inside

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
torches and everything from the inside

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.580 
torches and everything from the inside
but<00:06:17.510> there<00:06:17.690> you<00:06:17.750> guys<00:06:17.840> go<00:06:17.900> that<00:06:18.200> is<00:06:18.350> that

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
but there you guys go that is that

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.950 
but there you guys go that is that
probably<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.310> best<00:06:19.340> way<00:06:19.880> to<00:06:19.910> hide<00:06:20.270> anything

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
probably the best way to hide anything

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.450 
probably the best way to hide anything
you<00:06:21.050> ever<00:06:21.320> want<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.710> hide<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:21.890> Minecraft<00:06:22.340> you
