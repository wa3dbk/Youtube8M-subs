00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
foot last step I want to do is just to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.500 
foot last step I want to do is just to
wet<00:00:58.560> this<00:00:58.740> top<00:00:58.980> edge<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> compress<00:00:59.880> it<00:01:00.060> we<00:01:00.390> can

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
wet this top edge and compress it we can

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:19.080 
wet this top edge and compress it we can
use<00:01:00.630> my<00:01:00.810> fingers<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.710> use<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.890> rubber<00:01:02.070> rib

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.719 

I<00:01:19.210> do<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.960> throne<00:01:20.289> flight<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:21.009> I<00:01:21.310> start<00:01:21.609> off<00:01:21.700> by

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
I do a throne flight is I start off by

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.749 
I do a throne flight is I start off by
trimming<00:01:22.149> a<00:01:22.299> foot<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.009> I'm<00:01:24.189> going<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.369> slip<00:01:24.609> in

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
trimming a foot and I'm going to slip in

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.639 
trimming a foot and I'm going to slip in
score<00:01:25.799> actual<00:01:26.799> foot<00:01:27.009> ring<00:01:28.289> yeah

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
score actual foot ring yeah

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.919 
score actual foot ring yeah
the<00:01:30.069> reason<00:01:30.429> I<00:01:30.549> would<00:01:30.700> want<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.939> do<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.270> one

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
the reason I would want to do this one

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.469 
the reason I would want to do this one
is<00:01:32.200> if<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:32.740> want<00:01:33.009> my<00:01:33.189> bowl<00:01:33.909> just<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.329> have<00:01:34.450> a

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
is if I want my bowl just to have a

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.809 
is if I want my bowl just to have a
little<00:01:34.840> more<00:01:35.280> elevation<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.640> has<00:01:36.789> a

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
little more elevation this has a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.669 
little more elevation this has a
pedestal<00:01:37.149> foot<00:01:37.600> which<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:38.140> can<00:01:38.350> get<00:01:38.500> pretty

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
pedestal foot which you can get pretty

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.309 
pedestal foot which you can get pretty
easily<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.179> leave<00:01:40.479> yourself<00:01:40.569> enough<00:01:40.959> clay

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
easily if you leave yourself enough clay

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.590 
easily if you leave yourself enough clay
you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.500> trim<00:01:41.829> it<00:01:41.859> out<00:01:42.039> or<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.909> can<00:01:43.149> throw<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.509> on

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
you can trim it out or I can throw it on

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.169 
you can trim it out or I can throw it on
so<00:01:44.319> one<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.709> to<00:01:44.740> really<00:01:45.100> create<00:01:45.369> more<00:01:45.939> of<00:01:46.090> an

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
so one is to really create more of an

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.590 
so one is to really create more of an
elevated<00:01:46.630> stance<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.520> other<00:01:48.670> reason<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.329> if<00:01:49.479> I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
elevated stance the other reason is if I

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.880 
elevated stance the other reason is if I
have<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:49.810> bowl<00:01:50.079> that's<00:01:50.259> heavily<00:01:50.590> altered

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
have a bowl that's heavily altered

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.859 
have a bowl that's heavily altered
perhaps<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.700> want<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.939> alter<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.360> foot<00:01:52.569> ring<00:01:52.720> so

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
perhaps I want to alter the foot ring so

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.120 
perhaps I want to alter the foot ring so
that<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.049> really<00:01:53.170> makes<00:01:53.380> sense<00:01:53.649> with<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.950> bowl

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
that it really makes sense with the bowl

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.949 
that it really makes sense with the bowl
you<00:01:54.250> can<00:01:54.399> see<00:01:54.549> right<00:01:54.700> now<00:01:54.909> it's<00:01:55.599> a<00:01:55.720> pretty

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
you can see right now it's a pretty

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.919 
you can see right now it's a pretty
ordinary<00:01:56.200> foot<00:01:56.709> ring<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.280> not<00:01:58.179> that<00:01:58.360> exciting

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
ordinary foot ring so not that exciting

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.139 
ordinary foot ring so not that exciting
and<00:01:59.140> maybe<00:01:59.979> this<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.310> bowl<00:02:00.489> wants<00:02:00.849> a<00:02:00.939> foot

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
and maybe this the bowl wants a foot

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.889 
and maybe this the bowl wants a foot
ring<00:02:01.329> that's<00:02:01.509> just<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.989> little<00:02:03.599> has<00:02:04.599> a<00:02:04.629> little

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
ring that's just a little has a little

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.400 
ring that's just a little has a little
more<00:02:05.079> motion<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.539> start<00:02:07.929> off<00:02:08.110> with<00:02:08.140> a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
more motion to it so I start off with a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.000 
more motion to it so I start off with a
coil<00:02:08.769> of<00:02:08.950> clay

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.330 

the<00:02:17.550> size<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.690> coil<00:02:19.190> determines<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
the size of my the coil determines the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
the size of my the coil determines the
height<00:02:20.519> of<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.030> foot<00:02:21.209> ring<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.750> larger<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
height of the foot ring the larger the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.750 
height of the foot ring the larger the
coil<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.709> more<00:02:22.860> height<00:02:23.040> I'll<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.340> able<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.549> get

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
coil the more height I'll be able to get

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.539 
coil the more height I'll be able to get
out<00:02:23.879> of<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.409> slip<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.560> score<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> coil<00:02:26.159> slip

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
out of it slip and score the coil slip

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.789 
out of it slip and score the coil slip
and<00:02:26.700> score<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> footing<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.659> I'm<00:02:28.379> just<00:02:28.590> going

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
and score the footing and I'm just going

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:52.180 
and score the footing and I'm just going
to<00:02:28.890> press<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> on

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.710 

it's<00:02:52.520> going<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.820> take<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> moment<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.600> to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
it's going to take a moment just to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.120 
it's going to take a moment just to
really<00:02:54.050> make<00:02:54.320> sure<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.740> nice<00:02:55.100> and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
really make sure that it's nice and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.569 
really make sure that it's nice and
attached

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.009 

now<00:03:03.579> I'm<00:03:03.670> going<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.849> throw<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.239> just<00:03:04.569> as<00:03:04.689> if<00:03:04.870> it

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
now I'm going to throw it just as if it

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.989 
now I'm going to throw it just as if it
were<00:03:05.109> a<00:03:05.170> little<00:03:05.349> pot<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:06.549> only<00:03:06.700> difference

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:06.999 
were a little pot the only difference

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.369 
were a little pot the only difference
here<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.299> I'm<00:03:07.540> going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.959> try<00:03:08.139> to<00:03:08.170> use<00:03:08.349> a

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
here is that I'm going to try to use a

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.000 
here is that I'm going to try to use a
minimum<00:03:08.889> of<00:03:09.129> water<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.120> use<00:03:10.269> too<00:03:10.420> much<00:03:10.569> water

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
minimum of water if I use too much water

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.770 
minimum of water if I use too much water
I<00:03:12.010> might<00:03:12.579> turn<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.909> bottom<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.269> my<00:03:13.420> bowl<00:03:13.599> back

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
I might turn the bottom of my bowl back

opened a little soon maybe it wasn't
quite<00:04:11.750> centered<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.360> great<00:04:14.600> way<00:04:14.720> to

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
quite centered this is a great way to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.840 
quite centered this is a great way to
even<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.200> out<00:04:15.319> so<00:04:15.920> I've<00:04:16.010> wet<00:04:16.190> fingertips<00:04:16.700> on

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
even it out so I've wet fingertips on

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.300 
even it out so I've wet fingertips on
the<00:04:16.880> inside<00:04:17.419> I'm<00:04:17.870> gonna<00:04:18.139> slowly<00:04:18.530> insert<00:04:19.130> my

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
the inside I'm gonna slowly insert my

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.250 
the inside I'm gonna slowly insert my
pin<00:04:19.549> tool<00:04:19.790> until<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> touches<00:04:20.540> my<00:04:20.690> finger<00:04:21.019> and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
pin tool until it touches my finger and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.530 
pin tool until it touches my finger and
then<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.530> lift<00:04:21.769> off<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:25.180> perfectly<00:04:26.180> even

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
then I lift off and it's perfectly even

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.629 
then I lift off and it's perfectly even
once<00:04:26.720> again

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.339 

so<00:04:31.120> I'm<00:04:31.210> just<00:04:31.360> gonna<00:04:31.479> rub<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.930> little<00:04:32.169> foot

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
so I'm just gonna rub this little foot

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:44.960 
so I'm just gonna rub this little foot
ringing<00:04:36.389> ready

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.120 

and<00:04:45.450> this<00:04:45.630> really<00:04:45.840> does<00:04:45.930> change<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.560> form<00:04:47.010> of

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
and this really does change the form of

00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:20.540 
and this really does change the form of
the<00:04:47.190> bull

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:32.939 

treatment<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.419> excess<00:05:21.810> water

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.520 

make<00:05:33.430> sure<00:05:33.610> I'm<00:05:33.729> happy<00:05:33.909> with<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:35.349> edge

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
make sure I'm happy with the edge

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:51.100 
make sure I'm happy with the edge
quality

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.350 

okay<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.920> now<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.190> biggest<00:05:53.550> perk<00:05:54.030> of<00:05:54.300> having

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
okay and now the biggest perk of having

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.440 
okay and now the biggest perk of having
a<00:05:54.720> thrown<00:05:54.960> foot<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.790> kind<00:05:56.790> of<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:56.970> reason

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
a thrown foot and kind of the reason

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.450 
a thrown foot and kind of the reason
well<00:05:58.200> I<00:05:58.290> think<00:05:58.380> it's<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.740> great<00:05:58.950> thing<00:05:58.980> to<00:05:59.160> try

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
well I think it's a great thing to try

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.030 
well I think it's a great thing to try
is<00:05:59.730> I<00:05:59.940> can<00:06:00.150> alter<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.720> foot<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.890> it

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
is I can alter the foot so that it

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.800 
is I can alter the foot so that it
really<00:06:02.400> makes<00:06:02.760> sense<00:06:03.030> with<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.420> rim<00:06:03.600> of<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
really makes sense with the rim of the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.050 
really makes sense with the rim of the
bowl<00:06:05.660> it<00:06:06.660> can<00:06:06.840> have<00:06:06.960> just<00:06:07.170> as<00:06:07.380> much<00:06:07.560> motion<00:06:08.250> and

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
bowl it can have just as much motion and

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.760 
bowl it can have just as much motion and
now<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.270> bowl<00:06:09.540> will<00:06:09.750> look<00:06:09.870> like<00:06:09.990> it's<00:06:10.200> dancing

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
now the bowl will look like it's dancing

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.590 
now the bowl will look like it's dancing
across<00:06:11.040> the<00:06:11.340> surface<00:06:11.550> kind<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.420> has<00:06:12.570> a

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
across the surface kind of has a

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.030 
across the surface kind of has a
fluttering<00:06:13.050> edge<00:06:13.350> to<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.740> and<00:06:15.440> because<00:06:16.440> the

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
fluttering edge to it and because the

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.640 
fluttering edge to it and because the
foot<00:06:17.370> is<00:06:17.400> soft<00:06:17.820> right<00:06:18.630> now<00:06:18.810> as<00:06:19.110> opposed<00:06:19.530> to

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
foot is soft right now as opposed to

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.590 
foot is soft right now as opposed to
trimming<00:06:19.890> it<00:06:20.070> when<00:06:20.190> it's<00:06:20.310> leather<00:06:20.520> hard<00:06:20.850> I<00:06:21.090> can

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
trimming it when it's leather hard I can

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.440 
trimming it when it's leather hard I can
really<00:06:21.990> move<00:06:22.170> this<00:06:22.350> around<00:06:22.530> quite<00:06:23.010> a<00:06:23.040> bit<00:06:23.450> now

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
really move this around quite a bit now

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.900 
really move this around quite a bit now
I<00:06:24.480> can<00:06:24.660> continue<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.170> go<00:06:25.260> around<00:06:25.350> here<00:06:25.730> okay

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
I can continue to go around here okay

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.480 
I can continue to go around here okay
so<00:06:27.270> trim<00:06:27.900> to<00:06:28.020> feed<00:06:28.200> on<00:06:28.350> all<00:06:28.500> your<00:06:28.680> bowls<00:06:28.890> and<00:06:29.160> I

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
about 10 or 15 minutes upside down

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.470 
about 10 or 15 minutes upside down
before<00:06:37.410> you<00:06:37.710> tip<00:06:37.920> it<00:06:37.950> over<00:06:38.180> just<00:06:39.180> so<00:06:39.270> that<00:06:39.390> it

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
before you tip it over just so that it

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.160 
before you tip it over just so that it
doesn't<00:06:39.510> squish<00:06:40.080> this<00:06:40.290> foot<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:42.780> can<00:06:42.930> see<00:06:43.080> how

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.910 
that really changes the form of the bowl
you<00:06:45.980> know<00:06:46.980> as<00:06:47.190> opposed<00:06:47.490> to<00:06:47.550> this<00:06:47.730> one
