 we find him doing what is part of his mornings 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.869
 For some reason, what seemed strange to us was that his 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.890
 most precious treasure 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.769
 in a short time he showed us why 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.769

 It's as weird as its name 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.100
 but not from the inprés producer more extravagant melodies and little 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.499

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.540

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.960
 when you need to be needed for this segment actually 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.490
 the air 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.040
 it is not so much the technique that Europe uses to breathe 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.400

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.050
 that allows you to look 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.350
 one hour of being necessary sounding the intis cut in health is a 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 wonderful instrument 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.470

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.720

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.880
