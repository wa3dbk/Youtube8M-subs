00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
have scored the first two round I think

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.509

for<00:00:59.059> one<00:00:59.239> thing<00:00:59.449> I<00:00:59.570> see<00:01:00.019> is<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:00.469> lane<00:01:00.649> is

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
for one thing I see is that the lane is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.380 
for one thing I see is that the lane is
getting<00:01:01.100> hit<00:01:01.280> with<00:01:01.399> that<00:01:01.579> right<00:01:01.820> hand<00:01:01.850> time

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
you don't like to see that because

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.950 
you don't like to see that because

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
with the fact that he didn't have that

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.300 
with the fact that he didn't have that
much<00:05:48.390> ring<00:05:48.690> experience<00:05:49.380> but<00:05:49.590> he<00:05:49.950> came<00:05:50.100> on

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
much ring experience but he came on
