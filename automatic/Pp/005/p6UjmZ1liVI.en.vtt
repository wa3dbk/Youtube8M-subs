management
well<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:06.979> think<00:01:07.159> comparing<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.329> top<00:01:08.890> coaches

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
well I think comparing to top coaches

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.179 
well I think comparing to top coaches
like<00:01:10.810> Mourinho<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.439> Guardiola<00:01:13.040> is

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
like Mourinho and and Guardiola is

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.149 
like Mourinho and and Guardiola is
always<00:01:13.970> very<00:01:14.119> very<00:01:14.570> tough<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.500> have<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
always very very tough to have the

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.410 
always very very tough to have the
chance<00:01:16.399> to<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:17.299> choose<00:01:17.570> who<00:01:17.689> is<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.990> best<00:01:18.229> I

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
chance to to choose who is the best I

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.940 
chance to to choose who is the best I
don't<00:01:20.420> have<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:22.420> can't<00:01:23.420> talk<00:01:23.630> about<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:24.409> always

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
don't have I can't talk about I always

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.460 
don't have I can't talk about I always
work<00:01:25.220> with<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.640> pet<00:01:25.939> because<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.810> just<00:01:27.259> know

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
work with the pet because I just know

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.310 
work with the pet because I just know
him<00:01:27.619> from<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:29.179> time<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.929> played

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
him from the time that we played

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.160 
him from the time that we played
together<00:01:30.470> but<00:01:31.429> in<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.119> time<00:01:32.179> we<00:01:32.570> see<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.990> he

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
together but in that time we see that he

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.450 
together but in that time we see that he
was<00:01:33.320> already<00:01:35.080> like<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.110> manager<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.280> pitch

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
was already like a manager in the pitch

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.210 
was already like a manager in the pitch
I<00:01:38.179> think<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.899> have<00:01:38.990> ideas<00:01:39.470> very<00:01:39.619> clear<00:01:40.009> about

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
I think you have ideas very clear about

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.749 
I think you have ideas very clear about
his<00:01:40.640> philosophy<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.360> game<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.640> other

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
his philosophy of game and the other

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.389 
his philosophy of game and the other
side<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.030> think<00:01:44.229> Jose<00:01:45.229> if<00:01:45.670> made<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.880> why<00:01:47.810> since

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
side I think Jose if made is why since

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.669 
side I think Jose if made is why since
he<00:01:49.399> started<00:01:51.729> being<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:53.240> coaching<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.140> Barcelona

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
he started being a coaching in Barcelona

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.230 
he started being a coaching in Barcelona
no<00:01:54.920> helping<00:01:55.459> van<00:01:55.819> Gogh<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:57.970> both<00:01:58.970> they<00:01:59.209> are

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
no helping van Gogh and both they are

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.309 
no helping van Gogh and both they are
fantastic

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
fantastic

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.570 
fantastic
I<00:02:01.600> think<00:02:02.600> I'm<00:02:03.110> not<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:04.009> person<00:02:04.220> you're<00:02:04.459> going

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
I think I'm not the person you're going

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.880 
I think I'm not the person you're going
to<00:02:04.700> discover<00:02:04.970> them<00:02:05.299> what<00:02:05.869> they<00:02:06.049> they<00:02:06.380> won<00:02:06.619> in

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
to discover them what they they won in

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.779 
to discover them what they they won in
the<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.459> past<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:10.130> very<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.549> very

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the in the past so it's very is very

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.320 
the in the past so it's very is very
tough<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.269> to<00:02:11.690> see<00:02:11.870> who<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.079> best

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
tough to to see who is the best

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.690 
tough to to see who is the best
well<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> think<00:02:15.290> Josie<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:15.920> always<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> good

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
well I think Josie is always a good

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.090 
well I think Josie is always a good
choice<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:19.690> manager<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.720> any<00:02:21.710> kind<00:02:22.010> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
opportunity and the offer to do it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.810

a year that the things are not going so

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.360 
a year that the things are not going so
positive<00:04:51.390> but<00:04:52.290> doesn't<00:04:52.680> mean<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.130> not

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370
