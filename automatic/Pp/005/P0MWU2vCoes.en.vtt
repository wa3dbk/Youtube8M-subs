00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
real close-up shot look at this this is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
real close-up shot look at this this is
simply<00:00:53.670> spectacular<00:00:53.969> stuff<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.870> pans<00:00:55.350> around

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559

simply spectacular stuff it pans around
with<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.100> maybe<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> fast<00:00:57.000> shot<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
with you maybe not the fast shot is the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.389 
with you maybe not the fast shot is the
best<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> control<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.980> sort<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.219> gives

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
best to control because it sort of gives

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
best to control because it sort of gives
off<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> skewed<00:01:00.300> image<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.469> press<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
off a skewed image but if you press I to
move<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.789> closer<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.870> see

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
move a little bit closer you can see

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.469 
move a little bit closer you can see
that<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.890> very<00:01:05.129> nice<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.299> L

that it's very nice and if you use the L

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.600 
that it's very nice and if you use the L
key<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.380> switch<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.340> side

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
key you can actually switch on what side

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
key you can actually switch on what side
is<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.030> default<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.020> somewhat<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is on default it's like this somewhat to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.560 
is on default it's like this somewhat to
the<00:01:11.130> same<00:01:11.310> coordinates<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.270> maybe<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the same coordinates as this maybe a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
the same coordinates as this maybe a
little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.229> further<00:01:13.530> back<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
little bit further back there we go and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.749 
little bit further back there we go and
maybe<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.840> more<00:01:16.170> I've<00:01:17.130> completely

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
maybe a little bit more I've completely

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.820 
maybe a little bit more I've completely
ruined<00:01:18.060> ruin<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> default<00:01:19.290> position<00:01:19.470> all

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
ruined ruin the default position all

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.410 
ruined ruin the default position all
right<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.130> size<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.700> somewhat<00:01:21.180> seems

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
right this size this somewhat seems

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.570 
right this size this somewhat seems
pretty<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.890> gives<00:01:23.130> off<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> nice

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
pretty good but it gives off a nice

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.310 
pretty good but it gives off a nice
over-the-shoulder<00:01:24.090> view<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.200> you're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
