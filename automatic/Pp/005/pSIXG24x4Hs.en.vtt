00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
price and everything and I also bought

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.490 
price and everything and I also bought
this<00:00:39.930> adapter<00:00:42.079> right<00:00:43.079> there

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this adapter right there

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.810 
this adapter right there
this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> DVID<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.600> VGA<00:00:46.200> adapter<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this is a DVID to VGA adapter but it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.500 
this is a DVID to VGA adapter but it
didn't<00:00:48.090> work

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
didn't work

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
didn't work
I<00:00:48.539> wondered<00:00:49.260> why<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> after<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> bit<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
I wondered why and after a bit of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.180 
I wondered why and after a bit of
research<00:00:51.180> although<00:00:51.719> bachelors<00:00:52.410> can't<00:00:52.680> okay

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
research although bachelors can't okay

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.970 
research although bachelors can't okay
after<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> research<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.079> found<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
after bit of research I found out that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.560 
after bit of research I found out that
DVID<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.300> digital<00:00:57.840> only<00:00:58.730> bjs<00:00:59.730> analog<00:01:00.210> only

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
DVID is digital only bjs analog only

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
DVID is digital only bjs analog only
these<00:01:01.140> two<00:01:01.379> monitors<00:01:01.649> only<00:01:02.399> take<00:01:02.640> analog

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
these two monitors only take analog

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.530 
these two monitors only take analog
which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> VGA<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.060> obviously<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
which is VGA and obviously because it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.980 
which is VGA and obviously because it's
that<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.290> trying<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> make<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> direct<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.990> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that was trying to make a direct and the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.120 
that was trying to make a direct and the
direct<00:01:10.290> connection<00:01:10.590> between<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.070> two

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
direct connection between the two

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.390 
direct connection between the two
signals<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.760> wouldn't<00:01:12.030> work<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.380> found<00:01:14.250> out

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
signals it wouldn't work so I found out

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.330 
signals it wouldn't work so I found out
that<00:01:14.700> DVR<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> was<00:01:16.110> analog<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> digital<00:01:16.740> which

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that DVR I was analog and digital which

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
that DVR I was analog and digital which
my<00:01:17.520> computer<00:01:18.080> only<00:01:19.080> has<00:01:19.320> DVID<00:01:19.770> where<00:01:20.310> has<00:01:20.460> one

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
my computer only has DVID where has one

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.469 
my computer only has DVID where has one
VGA<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.360> DVID<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.670> on<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.030> moment<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
VGA and one DVID and on this moment of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
VGA and one DVID and on this moment of
run<00:01:24.659> off<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:26.570> direct<00:01:27.570> VGA<00:01:28.170> port<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
run off the direct VGA port and that is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
run off the direct VGA port and that is
run<00:01:30.000> off<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> DVID<00:01:30.570> port<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.259> tell<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> how<00:01:31.770> got

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
run off a DVID port now tell you how got

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.440 
run off a DVID port now tell you how got
this<00:01:32.070> working<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> order<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> new<00:01:35.450> DVID

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this working and I to order a new DVID

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.370 
this working and I to order a new DVID
cable<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.590> DVID<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.759> VGA<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:40.049> box

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
cable and a DVID to VGA and what box

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.140 
cable and a DVID to VGA and what box
converter<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> behind<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> monitors

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
converter which is behind the monitors

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
converter which is behind the monitors
which<00:01:42.329> I'll<00:01:42.509> show<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> second<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.470> won't

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
which I'll show you in a second I won't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.050 
which I'll show you in a second I won't
get<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.220> I'll<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.549> show<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.700> behind<00:01:44.939> the

get it out I'll just show you behind the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.210 
get it out I'll just show you behind the
monitors<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.479> hopefully<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.560> not

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
monitors and hopefully about it if not

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
monitors and hopefully about it if not
then<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.939> literally<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> box<00:01:48.570> where<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
then it's just literally a box where you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
then it's just literally a box where you
plug<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.380> DVID<00:01:50.159> cable<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.970> plugging<00:01:51.180> them

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
plug in a DVID cable then plugging them

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.249 
plug in a DVID cable then plugging them
onto<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.869> end

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
onto the other end

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.280 
onto the other end
simples<00:01:52.770> let's<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:54.540> demonstrations<00:01:55.200> now

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
simples let's do some demonstrations now

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
simples let's do some demonstrations now
with<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.710> two<00:01:56.219> monitors<00:01:58.430> right<00:01:59.630> succeed

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
with these two monitors right succeed

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.539 
with these two monitors right succeed
when<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.869> open<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:04.280> documents<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.369> stuff

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
when you open up and documents and stuff

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.020 
when you open up and documents and stuff
you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.969> drag<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.659> between<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.469> screens<00:02:08.250> as

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
you can drag them between two screens as

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
you can drag them between two screens as
you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.450> see<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.660> wallpaper<00:02:09.869> at<00:02:10.259> moments<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you can see my wallpaper at moments a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.150 
you can see my wallpaper at moments a
dual<00:02:10.860> screen<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:12.060> basically<00:02:12.569> London

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
dual screen one it's basically London

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
with a couple of Gaiman figures I have

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.120 
with a couple of Gaiman figures I have
no<00:02:20.120> idea<00:02:20.360> what<00:02:20.630> game<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.140> or<00:02:21.440> what<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.860> figures

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
no idea what game is or what the figures

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.710 
no idea what game is or what the figures
well<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:22.820> know<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> gaming<00:02:23.570> more

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
well I just know it's a gaming more

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.080 
well I just know it's a gaming more
paper<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.890> yet<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.250> can<00:02:25.370> drag<00:02:25.580> between<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
paper so yet you can drag between the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.410 
paper so yet you can drag between the
two<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.110> which<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:28.120> standard<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.360> every<00:02:31.420> every

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
two and which is standard on every every

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.450 
two and which is standard on every every
jewel<00:02:32.780> screen<00:02:33.050> system<00:02:33.230> or<00:02:33.860> triple<00:02:34.250> screen

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
jewel screen system or triple screen

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.520 
jewel screen system or triple screen
system<00:02:34.640> whatever<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.180> have<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:36.110> if<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.380> look

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
system whatever you have and if you look

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.040 
system whatever you have and if you look
at<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.770> tasks<00:02:37.070> but<00:02:37.430> down<00:02:37.790> there<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.870> may

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
at the tasks but down there you may

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.950 
at the tasks but down there you may
notice<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.650> one<00:02:39.860> when<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.220> drag<00:02:40.460> this<00:02:40.610> over

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
notice that one when I drag this over

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.630 
notice that one when I drag this over
that<00:02:41.960> this<00:02:42.170> would<00:02:42.680> disappear<00:02:43.100> from<00:02:43.250> there<00:02:43.490> and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that this would disappear from there and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.860 
that this would disappear from there and
it<00:02:43.700> would<00:02:43.790> go<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.300> ask<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:44.630> what

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
it would go on to that to ask for what

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.130 
it would go on to that to ask for what
shift<00:02:45.400> C<00:02:46.400> if<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.910> look<00:02:47.060> right<00:02:47.240> there<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.110> can

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
shift C if you look right there so I can

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.810 
shift C if you look right there so I can
now<00:02:48.470> minimize<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> third-party

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
now minimize this is a third-party

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.400 
now minimize this is a third-party
program<00:02:50.330> by<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.540> way<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> tease<00:02:51.080> because

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
program by the way I tease because

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.310 
program by the way I tease because
obviously<00:02:52.150> Windows<00:02:53.150> some<00:02:53.540> by<00:02:53.810> standard

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
obviously Windows some by standard

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.990 
obviously Windows some by standard
wanting<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:54.890> put<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> taskbar<00:02:55.460> on<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.700> second

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
wanting to put a taskbar on the second

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.950 
wanting to put a taskbar on the second
screen<00:02:56.120> which<00:02:56.330> i<00:02:56.420> think<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.690> bit<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.840> a

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
screen which i think is a bit of a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.130 
screen which i think is a bit of a
stupid<00:02:57.500> idea<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.330> can<00:02:59.480> minimize<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.840> for

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
stupid idea but you can minimize it for

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.390 
stupid idea but you can minimize it for
some<00:03:00.260> reason<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.620> goes<00:03:00.710> down<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.160> first

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
some reason it goes down to the first

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.070 
some reason it goes down to the first
screen<00:03:01.550> but<00:03:01.910> that's<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.720> way<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.870> third

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
screen but that's just the way the third

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.530 
screen but that's just the way the third
PI<00:03:03.290> program<00:03:03.710> works<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> quite<00:03:05.270> like<00:03:05.420> this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
PI program works but I quite like this

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.010 
PI program works but I quite like this
third-party<00:03:06.080> program<00:03:06.470> because<00:03:06.770> um<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.870> can

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
third-party program because um you can

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.330 
third-party program because um you can
tell<00:03:09.230> it's<00:03:09.440> much<00:03:09.590> easier<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.040> tell<00:03:10.220> what

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
tell it's much easier to tell what

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.680 
tell it's much easier to tell what
you've<00:03:10.460> got<00:03:10.580> open<00:03:10.850> on<00:03:10.940> one<00:03:11.150> screen<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.600> what

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
you've got open on one screen and what

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.750 
you've got open on one screen and what
you<00:03:11.750> got<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.960> from<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.170> other<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.760> etcetera

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
you got it from the other and etcetera

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.090 
you got it from the other and etcetera
so<00:03:14.690> for<00:03:15.050> example<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.680> could<00:03:15.800> have<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:19.010> can

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
so for example you could have you can

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.160 
so for example you could have you can
have<00:03:19.160> Google<00:03:19.610> Chrome<00:03:19.750> open<00:03:20.750> on<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:23.270> one<00:03:23.540> or

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
have Google Chrome open on this one or

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.100 
have Google Chrome open on this one or
this<00:03:25.100> one<00:03:25.160> for<00:03:25.430> an<00:03:25.520> example<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.959> can<00:03:26.990> have

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
this one for an example you can have

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.940 
this one for an example you can have
Google<00:03:27.470> Chrome<00:03:27.500> open<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:29.950> minecraft

good friends about a dual screen system
is<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.750> improves<00:03:57.200> productivity<00:03:58.480> much<00:03:59.480> easier

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
is it improves productivity much easier

game and chapter friends you can do that

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.770 
game and chapter friends you can do that
you<00:04:24.350> can<00:04:24.710> do<00:04:24.830> it<00:04:25.250> makes<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.910> able<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.180> do<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.360> lot

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
you can do it makes you able to do a lot

now<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.440> can<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:27.710> do<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:27.950> by<00:04:28.100> splitting

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
now you can just do that by splitting

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.880 
now you can just do that by splitting
splitting<00:04:29.600> two<00:04:29.750> windows<00:04:30.080> between<00:04:30.290> one<00:04:30.590> screen

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
splitting two windows between one screen

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.650 
splitting two windows between one screen
but<00:04:31.100> let's<00:04:31.250> face<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.970> doesn't<00:04:32.120> always<00:04:32.360> fit

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
but let's face it it doesn't always fit

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.180 
but let's face it it doesn't always fit
and<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:32.960> always<00:04:33.230> up<00:04:33.380> too<00:04:33.710> much<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.040> hassle

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
and it's always up too much of a hassle

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.250 
and it's always up too much of a hassle
and<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:35.150> have<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.360> have<00:04:35.450> fins<00:04:35.690> full<00:04:35.960> screen

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
and you have to have fins full screen

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.320 
and you have to have fins full screen
and<00:04:36.380> with<00:04:36.530> your<00:04:36.950> monitor<00:04:37.280> system<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:38.090> allows

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
and with your monitor system it allows

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.270 
and with your monitor system it allows
do<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.840> basically<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.470> can<00:04:39.650> have<00:04:40.040> full

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
do that basically so you can have full

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.220 
do that basically so you can have full
experience<00:04:40.790> on<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.030> web<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.390> for<00:04:41.840> experience

day<00:05:33.590> I<00:05:33.620> got<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.860> computer<00:05:34.300> if<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:35.419> look

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
day I got the computer if you look

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.450 
day I got the computer if you look
behind<00:05:35.720> you'll<00:05:36.530> see<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.770> little<00:05:36.919> red<00:05:37.130> light<00:05:37.160> and

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
behind you'll see a little red light and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.300 
behind you'll see a little red light and
that<00:05:37.610> is<00:05:37.729> basically<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.419> converter<00:05:39.350> box<00:05:39.470> for

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
that is basically the converter box for

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.940 
that is basically the converter box for
the<00:05:40.520> DVID<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.450> VGA<00:05:41.900> so<00:05:42.229> these<00:05:42.410> signals<00:05:42.650> will

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
the DVID to VGA so these signals will

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.250 
the DVID to VGA so these signals will
work<00:05:43.180> allowing<00:05:44.180> me<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.360> peril<00:05:44.750> this<00:05:44.900> monitor

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
work allowing me to peril this monitor
