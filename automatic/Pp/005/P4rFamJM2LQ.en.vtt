00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:11.980
 Yes Hello today will be on Thursday, February juke Date 2015 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.540
 Today is here 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.540
 Well then 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 Do you understand 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.789
 Olymps om d em 5 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:32.090
 It becomes mark ii 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:34.340
 It is quite large compared to the box of Olympus so far 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.170
 Of course I bought 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:45.110
 It is in pretty youtube will seal bar model 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:48.680
 I think that the black model is already posted, but the quality car of the silver model etc. 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.250
 I think if you can introduce 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.250
 So let's go straight to the unbox 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:03.530
 This time 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.280
 Things I Tteyuu high resolution shot to or mounted 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.640
 Oh 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.640
 What Dakke 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.350
 5-axis camera shake 5 Jikute shake it normal 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 Compared with em one 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.900
 It seems that more powerful 5 axis camera shake was installed 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 In ｰｰｰwas Olympus I'm being I profusely this time the video 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.960
 Ne 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.960
 Oh, it's like this inside 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:45.340
 But maybe I think the video bit rate is not that high 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.340
 Here is the Ministry of Security of Olympus 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.229
 Because the bit rate is not high 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:03.020
 Maybe I think that gh 4 and Kano are still strong for videos 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:07.609
 For camera shake om d em 5 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.410
 mark ii I think that there may be things quite amazing 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:16.340
 Something like this a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.340
 If there are always the box of the street 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:27.530
 This is the main body This is the main body 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 Let's take out the whole thing only for a little bit, do you want to see here ? 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.489
 Medium Yes looks like this 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.380
 And the strap is a strap first 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 A Te strap Da' 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.350
 USB 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 There is 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.840
 Badderi charger do the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.090
 Battery charger yo With ac adapter 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.100
 The battery will be om d series when it comes to battery all together 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.820
 I will 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:14.640
 The cat has a flash flash and it's a flash case 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:20.220
 We enter our familiar I'm feeling goods every time 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.950
 It is Rutte feeling contains Maamu manual is in here in 1 par 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:30.099
 A manual cd and such a feeling a 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:34.239
 A little thick manual to something thin manual to Olympus setup 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:37.470
 It feels like this, yes that 's it, let's see the body 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.470
 The body looks like this 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.500
 Olympus 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.500
 Is written 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:51.010
 It feels like 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.710
 The upper part is like this 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:00.230
 Most of the buttons 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.800
 It feels like it's better than m 1 compared to em goat 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.970
 In here too, that push is attached 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.030
 It becomes to feel say to be able to lock 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.880
 In a 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.049
 The battery here is red metal is orange plastic before it is metal 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.590
 become 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.590
 There 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:29.590
 So immediately put 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:32.790
 I think that is more of the time of this I plastic was easy to put 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.100
 Of in here. Well, as usual 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:41.409
 It is feeling that st says to the side, and management 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.310
 This liquid crystal has changed a lot later 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.950
 Move in the same feeling as the Toka this say g 1-way 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.750
 Is probably the biggest part 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.750
 Isn't it a change 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.740
 Yes i feel like this 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.020
 Yes 1 Seems to be at hand 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.259
 pm 1 silver body 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.969
 Good m No mark ii and 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:10.310
 What 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:13.569
 Since the first em one is em 5 a 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:18.279
 I think that I want to see and compare 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:21.759
 Haie here is here from em left is good 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:29.199
 em no mark ii 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:32.320
 Here em 5 magnitude and here sees I superstructure will be em one 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.920
 For example, it's getting thicker 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.210
 It looks like this 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.210
 What do you think 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:53.880
 Yes it's right here it's a little, because the lens has a professional lens 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:56.760
 But I once hard to understand and it is this em thing No in the mark of the first generation 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.370
 I this somewhat ThatLookLikeThis 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.129
 The overhang is different 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.980
 Let's try two 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:07.800
 You may not understand the difference like this 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.009
 Yes this is hey 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.090
 behind 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.940
 It will be the back 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.770
 Here are m 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.040
 5's 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:22.410
 am i will be 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.410
 Just because i changed only i cup 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.040
 It is different 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.370
 Back tree and this 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.190
 Or have root December 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:40.190
 It has still become the size of em one 4 e 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:42.689
 After all, when the liquid crystal moves like a tilt, it's because it's created with an awareness of the video 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:48.460
 I understand well 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:52.810
 Yes, that's what I introduced this time 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.660
 It becomes om d em 5 mark ii 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.009
 a 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.069
 Do it this way 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.120
 I silver color itself has entered quite to the other 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.750
 em one too 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.120
 It looks like em no. 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.960
 This is em school 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.590
 em one 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:20.639
 em 5 m 2 will be actually used feeling etc. also later 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:20.639
 I would like to upload videos so everyone has a nice day
