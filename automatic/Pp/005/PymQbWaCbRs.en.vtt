00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:08.063
 We are looking for passionate people who invest so much in 

00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:13.076
 human relationships only in their own work. 

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:19.215
 It is this dynamism that defines our company and its employees. 

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:23.126
 Our corporate culture is very special; 

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:26.982
 passion is ubiquitous and quality comes first. 

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:31.919
 All these values ​​are engraved around the orc in the yard. 

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:36.965
 Every element of our products is the result of careful work. 

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:41.424
 When you are surrounded by people motivated by the love of a job well done, 

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:46.694
 we want to always do better. It is an ideal environment. 

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:51.458
 We are looking for people who are always ready to excel, 

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:57.001
 and who constantly strive for excellence. 

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:01.310
 I think Blizzard is a very special place ... 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.437
 We have the resources of a very large company 

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:08.324
 and we operate with attention to detail and commitment 

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:11.613
 characteristics of small structures. 

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.485
 Even though we have grown to become this beautiful campus, 

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:18.880
 we are here for games, to create great games. 

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.013
 Our desire to all is to provide an incredible gaming experience, 

00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:26.403
 because we seek to live this experience ourselves. 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.461
 We can consider this as an art that we appreciate, 

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.132
 but to which one can also contribute. 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.072
 It is an environment conducive to creativity. 

00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:46.767
 And this creativity is not limited to graphic artists and musicians. 

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.966
 All Blizzard staff participate in game development. 

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:53.439
 Even if I'm not involved in the development of the game, 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.236
 I have very strong links with his creative process. 

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.120
 We are all encouraged to share our ideas 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.116
 and the best do not come from developers. 

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:05.989
 And that's the beauty of the case. 

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:14.322
 It is very motivating to work in a place where you are listening. 

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:18.629
 It's written in all our credits: designed by Blizzard Entertainment. 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.127
 This is the first thing we see and it is very revealing. 

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:23.433
 We are looking for people willing to invest in a team. 

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.471
 Self-help helps our colleagues improve their work 

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:28.315
 and receive the same support in return. 

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.157
 And this teamwork helps perfect the whole game. 

00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:35.080
 We create experiences and we build human relationships. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.314
 We create a story, a gaming experience 

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:42.930
 who talk to everyone, who ignore the borders. 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.601
 This ability to bring people together through their passion is very strong. 

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.263
 It's so rewarding to create a product 

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:56.797
 shared and loved by millions of people around the world. 

00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:58.900
 This is the place where dreams are created! 

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:08.202
 Blizzard has always encouraged the development of skills 

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:12.956
 through dialogue, mutual learning ... 

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:15.918
 All employees have opportunities to learn 

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:19.129
 and can take part in trainings on various subjects, 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.780
 like using software, time management or process. 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.039
 The Blizzard Academy is one of a kind. 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:32.785
 It is our responsibility to help our employees evolve 

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.845
 in order to create the best games in the industry. 

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:39.616
 Our employees are Blizzard's main resource 

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.466
 and we want to give them all the support we can. 

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:46.865
 We take each program and we improve it. 

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:51.446
 People work in a safe and pleasant environment 

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:53.536
 where they can experiment, try new things ... 

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:58.324
 The community spirit is very strong within the company. 

00:03:58.324 --> 00:04:01.034
 We are ... a bunch of geeks after all. 

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:08.195
 I can really be myself in the office. I can have a life. 

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:12.443
 I can talk to anyone, whether we know each other or not, 

00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.836
 and start a relationship immediately. 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.979
 I lead both a social and professional life in the workplace. 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.569
 It's great to be able to work with friends and colleagues. 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.568
 It's an incredible mix of people. 

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:38.173
 Our company is huge and our products are very successful. 

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:42.644
 Our work is seen and appreciated by millions of people, 

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:46.223
 but, at the same time, seen and criticized by so many people. 

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:50.197
 When we play a game with a friend, we try to beat him 

00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:53.033
 within established rules. 

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.470
 We are fighting against other gaming studios. 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.053
 What kind of business do you want to be? In what world do we want to live? 

00:05:00.053 --> 00:05:03.073
 It's one thing to work for a society at its best, 

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:06.499
 but it's another to find a motivated company 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.319
 to take the lead with an incredible sense of ethics. 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.834
 I do not do this job just because I love it, but also 

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.160
 because I believe in what we do. 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.412
 Why Blizzard? It's like asking: why work 

00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:22.256
 about the Apollo program? Why work on Enterprise? 

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:27.468
 I sometimes wonder if we intimidate people outside. 

00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:31.090
 None of us were excellent on arrival here. 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.149
 If excellence has been achieved, it is only thanks to our 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:41.828
 mutual investment and a corporate culture that pulls us up. 

00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:47.209
 And of course ... thanks to friendship. And that's the main thing for me.
