going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.529> releasing<00:00:17.010> from<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> 4s<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
going to be releasing from the 4s now a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.590 
going to be releasing from the 4s now a
lot<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.640> people<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.970> asking<00:00:21.000> me<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> this

lot of people are asking me is this
going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> problem<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.439> Apple<00:00:22.980> because

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
going to be a problem for Apple because

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.490 
going to be a problem for Apple because
it<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.880> didn't<00:00:24.210> generate<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> buzz<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it really didn't generate the buzz that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
it really didn't generate the buzz that
Apple<00:00:25.890> typically<00:00:26.369> generates<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> new

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
Apple typically generates with the new

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.089 
Apple typically generates with the new
release<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.140> lot<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.920> has<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
release like this a lot of that has to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
release like this a lot of that has to
do<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> fact<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.179> actually<00:00:30.539> not

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
do with the fact that it's actually not

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
do with the fact that it's actually not
much<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.349> an<00:00:31.560> improvement<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.250> mean<00:00:32.399> hugely

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
much of an improvement I mean hugely

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.900 
much of an improvement I mean hugely
improvement<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.020> apple<00:00:34.500> iphone<00:00:34.620> 4s<00:00:35.340> but

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
improvement from the apple iphone 4s but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.520 
improvement from the apple iphone 4s but
that<00:00:36.030> doesn't<00:00:36.329> necessarily<00:00:36.450> mean<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> bad

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad
sign<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:37.950> Apple<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> elaborate

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
sign for Apple I'm going to elaborate

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
sign for Apple I'm going to elaborate
that<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.620> bit<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:42.000> those

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that on here a little bit now for those

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
that on here a little bit now for those
of<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.329> who<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.020> iPhone<00:00:43.379> 5<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of you who don't know the iPhone 5 is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.340 
of you who don't know the iPhone 5 is
released<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> larger<00:00:45.629> screen<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.230> it's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
released with a larger screen so it's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.450 
released with a larger screen so it's
going<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> three<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> half<00:00:47.129> inch

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
going from a three and a half inch

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
going from a three and a half inch
screen<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> four<00:00:48.239> inch<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.780> also<00:00:49.200> has<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
screen to a four inch it also has the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
screen to a four inch it also has the
new<00:00:49.710> iOS<00:00:49.890> 6<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> new<00:00:51.149> Apple

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
new iOS 6 which is the new Apple

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.080 
new iOS 6 which is the new Apple
operating<00:00:52.050> system<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.699> also<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
operating system and it's also going to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.689 
operating system and it's also going to
have<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.660> better<00:00:54.930> camera<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> better

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
have a better camera and a better

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.660 
have a better camera and a better
processor<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:58.199> result<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.949> may<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
processor as a result you may have a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
processor as a result you may have a
little<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.180> decrease<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.780> battery<00:01:01.140> life

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
little bit decrease in battery life

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.260 
little bit decrease in battery life
because<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> processor<00:01:02.280> itself<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.789> faster

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
because the processor itself is faster

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.060 
because the processor itself is faster
and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> bigger<00:01:04.650> screen

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and you also have the bigger screen

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
and you also have the bigger screen
which<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:06.030> cause<00:01:06.210> another

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
which can actually cause another

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.140 
which can actually cause another
reduction<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.260> battery<00:01:07.530> life<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.860> well<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.939> in

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
reduction in battery life as well not in

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.250 
reduction in battery life as well not in
the<00:01:09.210> box<00:01:09.390> there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> couple<00:01:09.840> things<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.200> think

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the box there's a couple things I think

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
the box there's a couple things I think
they<00:01:10.500> might<00:01:10.680> run<00:01:10.860> into<00:01:11.040> they've<00:01:12.030> already

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they might run into they've already

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
they might run into they've already
talked<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> fact<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.260> developers

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
talked about the fact that developers

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.550 
talked about the fact that developers
have<00:01:14.280> written<00:01:14.520> apps<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.240> Apple<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.320> will

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
have written apps for Apple that will

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160 
have written apps for Apple that will
only<00:01:16.890> support<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:18.180> only<00:01:18.420> supported<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
only support have only supported the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
only support have only supported the
three<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> half<00:01:19.530> inch<00:01:19.799> screen<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.280> means

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
three and a half inch screen which means

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.530 
three and a half inch screen which means
the<00:01:20.580> developers<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> go

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the developers are going to have to go

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.210 
the developers are going to have to go
in<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> rewrite<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> support<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> full

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
in and rewrite it to support the full

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.640 
in and rewrite it to support the full
4-inch<00:01:23.820> screen<00:01:23.960> which<00:01:24.960> means<00:01:25.170> run<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
4-inch screen which means run out of the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.429 
4-inch screen which means run out of the
box<00:01:26.299> unless<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> developers<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.200> ahead

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
box unless the developers are like ahead

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
box unless the developers are like ahead
of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> curve<00:01:28.860> they're<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> do

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
of the curve they're going to have to do

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
of the curve they're going to have to do
a<00:01:30.060> modification<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.990> their<00:01:31.200> app<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.680> order<00:01:31.799> to

a modification to their app in order to

support the new apple iphone which is no
big<00:01:35.130> deal<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> consideration<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
big deal but it is a consideration to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490 
big deal but it is a consideration to
take<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.750> apple's<00:01:39.750> always<00:01:39.990> been<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> closed

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
take in apple's always been a closed

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
take in apple's always been a closed
platform<00:01:40.770> business<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.180> why

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
platform business and I think that's why

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.850 
platform business and I think that's why
androids<00:01:42.869> been<00:01:43.020> able<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> break<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.710> the

couple<00:01:45.689> years<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.369> about

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
couple years see you got to think about

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
couple years see you got to think about
it<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.790> developer<00:01:48.240> standpoint<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.840> you're

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it from a developer standpoint if you're

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.499 
it from a developer standpoint if you're
writing<00:01:49.200> an<00:01:49.409> app<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:50.100> an<00:01:50.220> apple<00:01:50.579> phone<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
writing an app for an apple phone you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.960 
writing an app for an apple phone you
have<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.110> luxury<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:53.009> only<00:01:53.340> having<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.759> write

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
have the luxury of only having to write

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.389 
have the luxury of only having to write
it<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.570> couple<00:01:54.869> pieces<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.320> hardware<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it for a couple pieces of hardware so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
it for a couple pieces of hardware so
you're<00:01:56.670> writing<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.960> iphone<00:01:58.290> 4

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you're writing it for the iphone 4

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.910 
you're writing it for the iphone 4
iphone<00:01:58.649> 4s<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.909> iphone<00:02:00.390> 5<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.750> iphone<00:02:01.200> 3<00:02:01.740> you

iphone 4s and iphone 5 and iphone 3 you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
iphone 4s and iphone 5 and iphone 3 you
know<00:02:02.009> what<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.159> mean<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.000> those<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
know what I mean and so those are the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.789 
know what I mean and so those are the
only<00:02:03.659> ones<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> test<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.560> but

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
only ones you have to test it on but

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
only ones you have to test it on but
with<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> android<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> test<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> on

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
with a android you have to test it on

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
with a android you have to test it on
like<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.489> hundred<00:02:08.729> different

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
like what is it like a hundred different

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
like what is it like a hundred different
phones<00:02:09.420> now<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.140> those<00:02:10.289> phones<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
phones now and then those phones have

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.780 
phones now and then those phones have
different<00:02:11.039> versions<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> operating

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
different versions of the operating

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.150 
different versions of the operating
system<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:12.870> each

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
system and then each

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.650 
system and then each
one<00:02:13.220> has<00:02:13.370> different<00:02:13.520> battery<00:02:14.060> lives<00:02:14.360> in

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
one has different battery lives in

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.630 
one has different battery lives in
different<00:02:14.960> considerations<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.460> result

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
different considerations so as a result

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.700 
different considerations so as a result
the<00:02:17.060> apps<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.780> come<00:02:17.930> out<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.290> Apple

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
the apps that come out of the Apple

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.620 
the apps that come out of the Apple
Store<00:02:18.920> tend<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> lot<00:02:19.730> more<00:02:19.760> stable<00:02:20.270> and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
Store tend to be a lot more stable and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.410 
Store tend to be a lot more stable and
that's<00:02:20.960> because<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.320> hardware

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
that's because of the hardware

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.280 
that's because of the hardware
restrictions<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.660> put<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.110> you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
restrictions that they put on it you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.320 
restrictions that they put on it you
know<00:02:24.320> developers<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.790> know<00:02:25.880> only<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.210> to

know developers you know only have to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.480 
know developers you know only have to
write<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.570> two<00:02:26.720> pieces<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.080> hardware<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.590> the

write for two pieces of hardware on the
other<00:02:28.670> hand<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.360> don't<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.870> luxury<00:02:30.080> of

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
and that's where I'm kind of seeing this

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.470 
and that's where I'm kind of seeing this
merger<00:02:37.010> here<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.550> I'm<00:02:37.640> kind<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.970> seeing<00:02:38.120> Apple

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
merger here and I'm kind of seeing Apple

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.890 
merger here and I'm kind of seeing Apple
fall<00:02:38.810> behind<00:02:39.050> in<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.220> actual<00:02:40.510> apple<00:02:41.510> market

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
fall behind in the actual apple market

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.110 
fall behind in the actual apple market

or in the actual smartphone market and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000 
or in the actual smartphone market and
the<00:02:44.720> reason<00:02:44.990> that<00:02:45.020> causes<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> problem<00:02:45.620> for

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
the reason that causes a problem for

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.220 
the reason that causes a problem for
them<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.250> because<00:02:46.430> they've<00:02:46.730> always<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:48.110> know

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
them is because they've always you know

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.200 
them is because they've always you know
they've<00:02:48.410> always<00:02:48.530> lived<00:02:48.830> off<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:50.030> have

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
they've always lived off of the we have

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.930 
they've always lived off of the we have
the<00:02:50.390> best<00:02:50.900> latest<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.440> greatest<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the best latest and greatest and the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.120 
the best latest and greatest and the
most<00:02:53.210> technologically<00:02:53.990> savvy<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.920> know<00:02:55.010> what

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
most technologically savvy you know what

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.180 
most technologically savvy you know what
I<00:02:55.190> mean<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.390> future<00:02:56.770> well<00:02:57.770> when<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.070> got

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
I mean it's the future well when you got

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.770 
I mean it's the future well when you got
multiple<00:02:58.880> third-party<00:02:59.090> companies<00:02:59.690> like

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
multiple third-party companies like

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.690 
multiple third-party companies like
samsung<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:01.450> motorola<00:03:03.250> developing<00:03:04.250> hardware

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
samsung and motorola developing hardware

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.520 
samsung and motorola developing hardware
for<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:05.390> apple<00:03:05.750> front<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.170> google

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
for you like apple front like google

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.090 
for you like apple front like google
does<00:03:06.740> then<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.880> tend<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.900> beat<00:03:09.320> out<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
does then you tend to beat out the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.390 
does then you tend to beat out the
competition<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> that's<00:03:12.200> why<00:03:12.470> androids<00:03:13.190> come

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
competition so that's why androids come

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.460 
competition so that's why androids come
such<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.670> such<00:03:14.240> a<00:03:14.270> long<00:03:14.570> way<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.020> such<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> short

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
such a such a long way in such a short

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.560 
such a such a long way in such a short
period<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.950> time<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.490> that's<00:03:17.090> also<00:03:17.420> why

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
period of time and that's also why

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.970 
period of time and that's also why
there's<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.870> lot<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.050> immediate<00:03:18.470> concerns<00:03:18.830> for

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
there's a lot of immediate concerns for

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.370 
there's a lot of immediate concerns for
the<00:03:19.040> Apple<00:03:19.430> hardware<00:03:19.700> guys<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:21.230> also

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
the Apple hardware guys and it also

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.470 
the Apple hardware guys and it also
allows<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.980> cost<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.490> be<00:03:22.580> driven<00:03:22.790> down<00:03:22.940> for

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
allows the cost to be driven down for

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.410 
allows the cost to be driven down for
the<00:03:24.010> Android<00:03:25.010> hardware<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.850> that's<00:03:26.300> why

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
the Android hardware so that's why

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.180 
the Android hardware so that's why
google<00:03:26.780> android<00:03:27.320> phones<00:03:27.530> tend<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.070> lot

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
google android phones tend to be a lot

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.490 
google android phones tend to be a lot
cheaper<00:03:28.600> because<00:03:29.600> there's<00:03:29.990> more<00:03:30.170> competition

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
cheaper because there's more competition

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.010 
cheaper because there's more competition
for<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.250> devices<00:03:31.700> themselves<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.480> so

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
for the devices themselves and so

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.440 
for the devices themselves and so
motorola<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.760> motorolas<00:03:35.300> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
motorola and the the motorolas the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.710 
motorola and the the motorolas the
t-mobile's<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.910> htcs<00:03:37.910> they're<00:03:38.270> all<00:03:38.390> forced

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
t-mobile's the htcs they're all forced

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.270 
t-mobile's the htcs they're all forced
to<00:03:38.810> compete<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.290> each<00:03:39.320> other<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:39.800> price<00:03:40.070> and

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
to compete with each other on price and

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.970 
to compete with each other on price and
so<00:03:41.180> that's<00:03:41.390> another<00:03:41.660> another<00:03:42.230> bonus<00:03:42.709> fact

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
so that's another another bonus fact

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.860 
so that's another another bonus fact
they<00:03:43.250> have<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.090> think<00:03:44.209> it's<00:03:44.480> safe<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.690> say

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
they have so I think it's safe to say

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.220 
they have so I think it's safe to say
with<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.560> galaxy<00:03:46.250> s<00:03:46.400> Samsung<00:03:47.270> Galaxy<00:03:47.810> S<00:03:47.930> being

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
out it's the hardware is definitely

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.170 
out it's the hardware is definitely
superior<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.290> Android<00:03:51.709> side<00:03:51.950> now<00:03:52.940> just

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
superior on the Android side now just

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.729 
superior on the Android side now just
because<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> hardware<00:03:53.870> superior<00:03:54.380> doesn't

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
because the hardware superior doesn't

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.710 
because the hardware superior doesn't
mean<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.980> product<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.520> superior<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.600> does

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
mean the product is superior but it does

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.880 
mean the product is superior but it does
mean<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.020> will<00:03:57.200> be<00:03:57.380> faster<00:03:57.920> hardware<00:03:59.890> apples

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890

the<00:04:19.580> iphone<00:04:19.850> 5<00:04:20.030> i<00:04:20.060> think<00:04:20.299> is<00:04:20.390> a<00:04:20.419> great<00:04:20.600> product

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
the iphone 5 i think is a great product

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.170 
the iphone 5 i think is a great product
but<00:04:21.410> i<00:04:21.620> think<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:21.950> does<00:04:22.100> kind<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.400> stand<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:22.940> at

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
but i think it does kind of stand as at

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
but i think it does kind of stand as at
this<00:04:23.419> point<00:04:23.690> as<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> kind<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:24.770> attorney

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
this point as a kind of attorney

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.660 
this point as a kind of attorney
point<00:04:25.440> for<00:04:25.590> Apple<00:04:25.920> owning<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> hardware

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
point for Apple owning the hardware

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.280 
point for Apple owning the hardware
market<00:04:26.880> for<00:04:27.210> smartphones<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.050> think<00:04:28.200> they're

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
market for smartphones I think they're

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.570 
market for smartphones I think they're
gonna<00:04:28.410> have<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.620> really<00:04:28.950> deliver<00:04:29.130> something

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
gonna have to really deliver something

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.910 
gonna have to really deliver something
huge<00:04:30.090> next<00:04:30.450> time<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.930> think<00:04:31.320> that's<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.650> setback

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
huge next time I think that's a setback

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.800 
huge next time I think that's a setback
for<00:04:32.340> them<00:04:32.490> but<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.240> don't<00:04:33.510> think<00:04:33.570> they're<00:04:33.720> gonna

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
for them but I don't think they're gonna

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.270 
for them but I don't think they're gonna
have<00:04:33.960> any<00:04:34.110> trouble<00:04:34.290> selling<00:04:34.710> them<00:04:34.980> because

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
have any trouble selling them because

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.040 
have any trouble selling them because
they<00:04:35.430> still<00:04:35.700> offer<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.300> stability<00:04:36.690> and

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
they still offer that stability and

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.170 
they still offer that stability and
extended<00:04:37.500> battery<00:04:37.860> life<00:04:38.070> over<00:04:38.370> many<00:04:38.730> Android

2<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.600> me<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:45.990> not<00:04:46.170> really<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.530> new<00:04:47.100> iPhone

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
2 to me it's not really a new iPhone

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.650 
2 to me it's not really a new iPhone
because<00:04:48.060> there's<00:04:48.240> nothing<00:04:48.360> really

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
because there's nothing really

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.810 
because there's nothing really
significant<00:04:49.470> in<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.800> changes<00:04:50.310> between<00:04:50.490> them

you could call that a reason to call the

but<00:04:58.530> i<00:04:58.560> don't<00:04:58.770> see<00:04:58.830> much<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.460> difference

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
but i don't see much of a difference

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.150 
but i don't see much of a difference
between<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> two<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:01.440> it's<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.800> all<00:05:01.920> goes

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
between the two but it's it all goes

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.260 
between the two but it's it all goes
back<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.520> same<00:05:02.700> attitude<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.090> know<00:05:03.120> if

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
back to that same attitude you know if

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.000 
back to that same attitude you know if
it's<00:05:03.360> not<00:05:03.510> broke<00:05:03.780> broke<00:05:04.200> don't<00:05:04.440> fix<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:04.770> you

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
know people always want something new

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.510 
know people always want something new
and<00:05:06.570> fresh<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.840> in<00:05:07.530> some<00:05:07.980> crazy<00:05:08.190> awesome

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
and fresh and in some crazy awesome

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.060 
and fresh and in some crazy awesome
interface<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.300> while<00:05:10.050> that's<00:05:10.170> exciting<00:05:10.650> it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
interface and while that's exciting it

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.520 
interface and while that's exciting it
also<00:05:11.340> comes<00:05:11.610> with<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.820> lot<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.090> complexities<00:05:12.840> so

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
also comes with a lot of complexities so

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.190 
also comes with a lot of complexities so
really<00:05:14.100> i<00:05:14.310> think<00:05:14.880> apple<00:05:15.600> will<00:05:15.630> step<00:05:15.930> up<00:05:16.020> their

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200

really i think apple will step up their
game<00:05:16.230> in<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.560> next<00:05:16.770> year<00:05:17.010> i<00:05:17.040> don't<00:05:17.340> think

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
