00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
didn't have the tire and that you're

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.430 
didn't have the tire and that you're
supposed<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> use<00:00:36.449> to<00:00:38.269> let<00:00:39.269> down<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.749> winch

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
that holds the spare tire up so I looked

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.389 
that holds the spare tire up so I looked
around<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.409> little<00:00:46.440> bit<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.859> couldn't<00:00:47.159> find

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
around a little bit and I couldn't find

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.619 
around a little bit and I couldn't find
anyone<00:00:48.089> selling<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> replacement<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
anyone selling a replacement so I

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.950 
anyone selling a replacement so I
decided<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.309> experiment<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:53.960> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
decided to experiment a little bit and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.369 
decided to experiment a little bit and
this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.620> able<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> find<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.730> so

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
this is what I was able to find out so

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.950 
this is what I was able to find out so
down<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.519> have<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.569> I<00:01:00.600> got

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
down here this is what I have now I got

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
down here this is what I have now I got
a<00:01:00.989> bottle<00:01:01.199> Jack<00:01:01.589> I<00:01:02.510> got<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.910> Grinch<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.790> some

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a bottle Jack I got the Grinch and some

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
a bottle Jack I got the Grinch and some
sockets<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:14.510> this<00:01:15.510> half<00:01:16.110> inch<00:01:16.730> extender<00:01:18.860> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
sockets and this half inch extender this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.120 
sockets and this half inch extender this
thing<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.190> reach<00:01:20.370> into<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:22.080> whole<00:01:22.380> original

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
thing will reach into the whole original

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.350 
thing will reach into the whole original
originally<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:23.940> got<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:26.550> half

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
originally I got this because this half

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620 
originally I got this because this half
inch<00:01:27.630> square<00:01:28.340> looked<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.730> about<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.300> as

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
inch square looked to be about right as

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.040 
inch square looked to be about right as
far<00:01:30.870> as<00:01:31.550> being<00:01:32.550> able<00:01:32.730> to<00:01:32.880> clamp<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
far as being able to clamp on to that

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.290 
far as being able to clamp on to that
however<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:36.300> diameter<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:38.000> won't<00:01:39.000> fit

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
however the diameter of this won't fit

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.320 
however the diameter of this won't fit
through<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.600> hole<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> bumper<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.460> I'll

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
through the hole on the bumper so I'll

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.429 
through the hole on the bumper so I'll
show<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:44.460> second<00:01:46.700> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
show you that in a second so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.870 
show you that in a second so
I'll<00:01:50.439> get<00:01:50.680> down<00:01:50.890> here<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.369> later<00:01:51.670> we<00:01:51.850> can

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
I'll get down here so that later we can

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.779 
I'll get down here so that later we can
see<00:01:52.740> inside<00:01:54.359> okay<00:01:55.359> there's<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:56.460> spare<00:01:57.460> tire

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
see inside okay there's the spare tire

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.719 
see inside okay there's the spare tire
let<00:01:58.719> down<00:01:59.549> lug<00:02:00.899> whatever<00:02:01.899> it's<00:02:02.170> called<00:02:02.729> it's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
let down lug whatever it's called it's

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.350 
let down lug whatever it's called it's
square<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:05.860> really<00:02:06.610> far<00:02:06.880> back<00:02:07.090> there

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
square and it's really far back there

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.130 
square and it's really far back there
and<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:08.619> above<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.940> tire<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.810> can't

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
and it's above the tire so you can't

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.890 
and it's above the tire so you can't
really<00:02:11.319> get<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.769> from<00:02:12.010> below<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.629> pair

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
really get to it from below with a pair

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
really get to it from below with a pair
of<00:02:13.930> pliers<00:02:14.260> or<00:02:14.739> whatever<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> let<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.489> down<00:02:16.440> so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
of pliers or whatever to let it down so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.729 
of pliers or whatever to let it down so
unfortunately<00:02:19.120> there's<00:02:19.810> no<00:02:19.930> socket<00:02:20.500> sets

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
unfortunately there's no socket sets

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.030 
unfortunately there's no socket sets
that<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.040> know<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.720> they<00:02:22.720> have<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.380> half<00:02:23.799> inch

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that I know of they have a half inch

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.720 
that I know of they have a half inch
square<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.400> both<00:02:24.730> sides<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.190> initially<00:02:30.519> got

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
square on both sides so I initially got

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.309 
square on both sides so I initially got
this<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:33.040> try<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.400> go<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.640> there<00:02:33.849> but<00:02:34.319> it

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
this to try and go in there but it

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.000 
this to try and go in there but it
doesn't<00:02:36.010> fit<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.319> then<00:02:38.319> I<00:02:38.349> also<00:02:38.590> have<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
doesn't fit and then I also have the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.670 
doesn't fit and then I also have the
problem<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.549> what<00:02:39.819> what<00:02:40.810> was<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.079> going<00:02:41.319> to

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
problem of what what was I going to

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.250 
problem of what what was I going to
attach<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.489> end<00:02:42.819> anyway<00:02:43.209> maybe<00:02:43.989> some

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
attach to that end anyway maybe some

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.130 
attach to that end anyway maybe some
pliers<00:02:44.530> or<00:02:44.799> something<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.720> what<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.810> ended<00:02:47.019> up

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
pliers or something but what I ended up

00:02:47.140 --> 00:03:00.289 
pliers or something but what I ended up
doing<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:50.620> putting<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.099> on<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> end<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.579> this<00:02:51.760> I

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.940 

found<00:03:01.299> out<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.880> size<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:05.019> socket<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:06.000> 9/16

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
found out this size of socket the 9/16

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:25.410 
found out this size of socket the 9/16
fit<00:03:08.950> into<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:15.180> fits<00:03:16.620> right<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.799> there<00:03:24.420> right

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
fit into this fits right in there right

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.089 
fit into this fits right in there right
over<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> end<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.849> look<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> point

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
over the end of that look to the point
