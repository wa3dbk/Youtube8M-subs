00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
let's take up the screen from here here

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:48.550 
let's take up the screen from here here
then<00:02:42.319> here<00:02:45.549> first<00:02:46.549> I<00:02:46.670> took<00:02:46.730> out<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.560> wheel

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
then here first I took out the wheel

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.050 
then here first I took out the wheel
just<00:02:49.069> for<00:02:49.340> better<00:02:51.400> better<00:02:52.400> view<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
just for better better view and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.360 
just for better better view and
everything<00:02:53.510> there<00:02:54.139> to<00:02:54.950> reach<00:02:55.220> -<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.280> that's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
everything there to reach - so that's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.759 
everything there to reach - so that's
what<00:02:58.639> I<00:02:58.670> did<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.359> then<00:02:59.569> I<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.930> popped<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.650> out

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
what I did and then I just popped it out

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:10.509 
what I did and then I just popped it out
with<00:03:01.780> what's<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:05.440> flattens<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.470> just<00:03:09.889> like<00:03:10.100> I

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
with what's the flattens so just like I

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.699 
with what's the flattens so just like I
popped<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.060> off

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.900 

be<00:03:17.709> careful<00:03:18.160> though<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:20.379> could<00:03:20.560> break

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
be careful though because it could break

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.800 
be careful though because it could break
that's<00:03:21.910> how<00:03:22.060> Hardy

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
that's how Hardy

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.270 
that's how Hardy
you<00:03:23.500> do<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:25.120> my<00:03:25.720> dad<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.080> running<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
you do that my dad is running the the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.729 
you do that my dad is running the the
optional<00:03:30.910> gear<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.720> came<00:03:31.989> with<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.319> Russell

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
the way he took it out was very very

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.309 
the way he took it out was very very
cool<00:03:52.780> cuz<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:54.220> motor<00:03:54.630> we're<00:03:55.630> just<00:03:55.840> gonna<00:03:55.989> find

cool cuz the motor we're just gonna find

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.110 
cool cuz the motor we're just gonna find
out<00:03:56.530> how<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.769> take<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.130> out<00:03:57.370> he<00:03:57.579> just<00:03:57.819> took<00:03:57.940> off

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
out how to take it out he just took off

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.490 
out how to take it out he just took off
the<00:03:58.390> screw<00:03:58.690> in<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.930> bottom<00:03:59.170> on<00:03:59.500> that<00:04:00.569> one<00:04:01.569> and

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
the screw in the bottom on that one and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.110 
the screw in the bottom on that one and
he<00:04:03.190> couldn't<00:04:03.549> seem<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.910> take<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.540> motor<00:04:05.170> out

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
he couldn't seem to take the motor out

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.080 
he couldn't seem to take the motor out
because<00:04:07.470> well<00:04:08.470> first<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.860> all<00:04:08.950> he<00:04:09.760> had<00:04:09.910> the
