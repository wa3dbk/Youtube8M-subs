00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.080
 The people today will show that the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.820
 processor of the report that will make a 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.680
 another milk on his computer 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.689
 he had a quad core and now he's going 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.550
 put this bulldozer here in little 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.300
 doses either do not know how to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.090
 pronunciation 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.720
 the eight - core FX is the fx 8150 the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.960
 clock of 3.3.1 6 ghz 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.230
 it has 16 mega total of cash being 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 8 is what I found 2008 is from the l3 cache 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.129
 totaling 16 megawatts in the hot sun since 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.530
 to m3 plus 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.799
 so let's show the box here 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.379
 she comes in a tin box reports a 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:06.380
 other similar material 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.619
 all specs here 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 showing the processor that the black 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.110
 edition that nÃ© 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.590
 the same game is made to play these 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 here for game and open processors 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.350
 that well one his cap one 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.950
 a little different with the lid 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.179
 conventional or that it should have a 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.149
 protector comes a paper that please 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:43.759
 read the first milk first please 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.399
 read this first here nobody reads here 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.789
 Comes the processor is pretty standard from amd 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.350
 Usually, this always comes in this hood. 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.380
 plastic 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.380
 here comes the processor and comes with this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:05.210
 Here the process here is within the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.740
 box come over here the manual all 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.660
 amd processors also comes with this 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 teaching manual you are in your team 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:17.080
 also someone is hardly 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.080
 this one is bad 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.600
 not so less important not that it comes 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.060
 cooler than the standard name 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.430
 it or to conclude that such 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.790
 here copper pipes do not go well 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.580
 different should probably be 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.230
 quite the heat of the processor 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.790
 I also forgot to mention the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.900
 consumption in watts 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.780
 tpi is 125 watts 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.330
 he has the 2.0 turbo core 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.570
 and it supports ddr3 memory processor 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.590
 of 1866MHz and you can make a golzinho 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.920
 Right? 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 and got the biggest clock she had 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.790
 again 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.010
 That's it folks, because we're going to do it. 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.820
 the boxing of the motherboard also 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.739
 that he bought and then we made a 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.070
 review happen mounted 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.070
 thanks
