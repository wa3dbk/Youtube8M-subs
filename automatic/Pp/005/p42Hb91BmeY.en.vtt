00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
smart enough so that they just know on

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
smart enough so that they just know on
their<00:01:10.439> own<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.310> next<00:01:11.520> few<00:01:11.610> town<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.090> be

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
their own but the next few town will be

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.819 
their own but the next few town will be
a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.510> simplistic
