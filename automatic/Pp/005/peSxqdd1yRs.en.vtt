00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
the graphics have a lot of room for

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.300 
the graphics have a lot of room for
improvement<00:03:11.650> especially<00:03:12.650> as<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.769> PlayStation

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
repetitive and it's very challenging the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.930 
repetitive and it's very challenging the
layout<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.799> similar<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.790> poor
