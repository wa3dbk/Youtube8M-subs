00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.250
 dough I take the flour called mine 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 mother yeast inside the dough 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.989

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.690
 add salt and oil this will not be 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.539
 a classic handmade dough I will leave 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.059
 my elements together for about 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.730
 half an hour and the time will succeed to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.180
 mix this let's say compound without 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.430
 never touch it after half an hour 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.859
 I take my dough as you see it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.110
 need so much kneading to this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.170
 point I put it inside the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.810
 container which I will then place for one 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.310
 whole night in the refrigerator to rest 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 baking paper the basis for which we will put 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.910
 the ingredients resting on ours 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.660

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.660
 our focaccia 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.660

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.760

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:52.510
