00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 after the success of our 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 amazing mug cake 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.429
 We insisted a lot on Maria Braga. 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.070
 lots of photos and lots of palm trees 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.280
 discovered a very cool way to do 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.809
 a mug pie separate that side 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.340
 here the ingredients of the dough and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.510
 distilled the ingredients of the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.760
 final freshness 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 so let's first make the dough are 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.359
 ingredients you have at home then 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 I'll put it in the game cup talking the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.000
 name of each 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 Let's start with an egg I'm going to break 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.219
 first goal inside the glass for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 people decide is not spoiled 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.250
 It's good now go four tablespoons of 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.110
 milk 3 tablespoons oil 4 tablespoons 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 flour a spoonful of chemical yeast and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.590
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.390
 we already put the ingredients of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.219
 mass and I'm going to put it now are the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.940
 ingredients that will give the flavor 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.620
 pie 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 If you do not have an account showing you can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 replace with something else you have 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.329
 Tomato-type home does things like that. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 so I'll put some olive 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.909
 ham and mozzarella minced corn 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.100
 green grated cheese 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.720
 You have to mix everything very well. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.250
 mixed and now just take the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 microwave for three minutes 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:47.540
 and this one is the mug pie of the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.540
 world manual 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.979
 if you want at home 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.570
 I highly recommend you put it on 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.020
 because the ingredient that gives a flavor 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.239
 very good in microwave pie more 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.310
 recipes 2 the kids here you 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.310
 find a world manual 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.850
 whenever we make these recipes 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.680
 microwave has plenty of people who 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.209
 writes asking how to do it 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 have microwaves 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.959
 in this case here also in the case of the cake 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.030
 this recipe is the same recipe 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.650
 that goes in the oven only that it is made in a 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.239
 slightly lower proportion 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.370
 so if you want to make this recipe 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.350
 in the oven it goes right also will 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.500
 logical need on neat mugs and 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.660
 need to place a metal container and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.070
 I do not know the exact time that will not be 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.489
 so you'll have to open it from time to time. 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.989
 when you take a peek so you do not burn 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.750
 the oven, I do not know if you 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.970
 open can give a little and then you 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.220
 have to do 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.650
