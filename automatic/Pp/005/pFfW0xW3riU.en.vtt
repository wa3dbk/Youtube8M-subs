I really don't want to go all the way

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
I really don't want to go all the way
through<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.810> wood<00:01:07.020> I'd<00:01:07.530> rather<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
through to the wood I'd rather have the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
through to the wood I'd rather have the
color<00:01:08.310> show<00:01:08.670> through<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.420> um<00:01:09.740> more<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
color show through for um more with just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
color show through for um more with just
like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> wood<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
like a little bit of the wood because I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
like a little bit of the wood because I
think<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.290> kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> cool<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
think that's kind of cool but it's all a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.830 
think that's kind of cool but it's all a
personal<00:01:15.930> choice<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.470> how<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
personal choice on how you want to do it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
personal choice on how you want to do it
right<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:18.990> i'm<00:01:19.140> using<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:20.060> pointer<00:01:21.060> finger<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
right now i'm using my pointer finger to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.010 
right now i'm using my pointer finger to
kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> work<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.830> off<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.820> also

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
kind of work it off but you can also

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.480 
kind of work it off but you can also
scrunch<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.439> into<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.979> pom-pom

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
scrunch it up like into a little pom-pom

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.090 
scrunch it up like into a little pom-pom
make<00:01:27.299> sure<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.750> wet<00:01:28.320> enough<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> do

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
make sure this is wet enough when you do

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
make sure this is wet enough when you do
it<00:01:29.250> otherwise<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.509> gonna<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> whole

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it otherwise it's not gonna do a whole

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.950 
it otherwise it's not gonna do a whole
lot<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:32.310> enough<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:32.939> too<00:01:33.000> wet<00:01:33.420> because

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
lot what enough but not too wet because

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800 
lot what enough but not too wet because
then<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.500> take<00:01:34.650> too<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.540> i<00:01:36.780> know

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
then it will take too much and i know

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510 
then it will take too much and i know
you<00:01:36.990> can't<00:01:37.259> tell<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> tell<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you can't tell it how to tell what this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
you can't tell it how to tell what this
is<00:01:38.759> by<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> picture<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.140> um<00:01:42.560> let's<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.710> how

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is by the picture but um let's see how

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.300 
is by the picture but um let's see how
easy<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.869> starts

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
easy that is and it just kind of starts

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630 
easy that is and it just kind of starts
taking<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.399> off<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> part

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
taking it off and and this is the part

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
taking it off and and this is the part
that<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:52.140> fun<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.860> me<00:01:53.040> because

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.940 

I<00:01:56.010> feel<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.390> make<00:01:57.710> something<00:01:58.710> look

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I feel like I can make something look

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
I feel like I can make something look
really<00:01:59.370> unique<00:01:59.729> doing<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.080> i<00:02:01.320> will

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
really unique doing this but i will

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
really unique doing this but i will
tinker<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.450> probably<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> couple

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
tinker with this probably for a couple

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.580 
tinker with this probably for a couple
days<00:02:05.300> doing<00:02:06.300> a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.020> stepping

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
days doing a little bit of it stepping

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.090 
days doing a little bit of it stepping
back

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.970
