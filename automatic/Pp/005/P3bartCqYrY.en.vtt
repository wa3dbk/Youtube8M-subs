requirements<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.869> many<00:01:24.990> cases<00:01:25.409> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
requirements in many cases so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
requirements in many cases so
operational<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
operational we think this is the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
operational we think this is the
ultimate<00:01:27.959> fourth<00:01:28.350> gen<00:01:28.560> capability<00:01:29.249> in

and<00:02:07.850> finally<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.869> think<00:02:08.990> this<00:02:09.500> would<00:02:09.649> be<00:02:09.679> a

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
and finally I think this would be a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.460 
and finally I think this would be a
great<00:02:10.039> opportunity<00:02:10.340> for<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.720> relationship

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
great opportunity for in a relationship

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.920 
great opportunity for in a relationship
between<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.640> United<00:02:13.970> States<00:02:14.210> Air<00:02:14.390> Force<00:02:14.720> in

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090

that Air Force Air Force relationship I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.790

for the trials which they shared with us

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.900 
for the trials which they shared with us
we<00:03:03.350> identify<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.860> timeframes<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:04.760> would

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
we identify the timeframes that we would

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.640 
we identify the timeframes that we would
go<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.120> trials<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.630> then<00:03:05.720> they<00:03:05.840> executed<00:03:06.500> at

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
go to trials and then they executed at

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.920 
go to trials and then they executed at
that<00:03:06.800> plan<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.940> when<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.209> build<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.570> type<00:03:08.870> of

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
that plan so when you build that type of

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.960 
that plan so when you build that type of
relationship<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:10.070> you<00:03:10.190> know<00:03:10.370> what<00:03:10.580> your<00:03:10.700> is

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
opportunity to perform it gives you a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.880

ability in addition like I've stated

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.930 
ability in addition like I've stated
before<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.440> f16<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.280> supervisor<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.910> a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
before the f16 I and supervisor is a

and<00:03:27.650> therefore<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.400> think<00:03:28.700> from<00:03:28.850> an<00:03:29.000> Indian

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
and therefore we think from an Indian

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.240 
and therefore we think from an Indian
Air<00:03:29.360> Force<00:03:29.390> standpoint<00:03:30.110> they<00:03:30.620> were<00:03:30.680> extremely

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
impressed one of the things that we did

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.440 
impressed one of the things that we did
was<00:03:34.510> we<00:03:35.510> tried<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:36.170> demonstrate<00:03:36.739> compliance
