00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:15.320
 and most indoor plants are 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.350
 of tropical zones these areas have 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.510
 a very specific climatology like 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.210
 they can be a very hot and humid 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.310
 elevated also these plants grow in 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.960
 soto forest where they get a light 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.380
 screened by trees larger 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.640
 the rains are constant and that too 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.710
 favors the humid environment 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.059
 let's try to give us some advice 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.160
 for which the inside of you 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.990
 homes are the closest thing to these 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.579
 conditions they have in their places of 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.970
 origin with regard to heat and 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.920
 humidity 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.600
 in principle the heat is not usually 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.000
 a problem think that in spring 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.130
 Summer temperatures are already adequate 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.140
 and in winter the use of heating is 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.239
 because it also guarantees this temperature 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.340
 that our plants need the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.420
 humidity is another subject the inside of 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.130
 our homes tend to be more 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.160
 dry and what we recommend is that 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.500
 you use revitalizing products of 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.930
 very easy application simply 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.100
 we shake the container and proceed to wet 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.100
 leaves 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.070
 As you can see, a water film forms 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.049
 what it does is guarantee that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.540
 moisture that the plant needs in the 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.250
 environment of the leaves with respect to water and 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.040
 I told you before that they are original 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.740
 of areas where there are frequent rains 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.790
 besides this water the rainwater is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.560
 water of very good quality 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.780
 what we would have to do is 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.729
 try to collect this rainwater or 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.190
 use mineral waters in case 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.409
 it is not possible to use the water 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.930
 common of our tap and there are small 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.810
 tricks that allows us to improve water one 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.840
 of them is filling the shower leave 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.580
 with water one day resting and this 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.580
 way we get it going by the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.030
 cloud evaporates chlorine what will 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.679
 to contribute is that we avoid these sheets 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.470
 burned 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.659
 Also, keep in mind that in 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.069
 the periods of growth 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.560
 spring-summer these plants are going to 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.970
 need a contribution of fertilizer to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 we have products 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.520
 that indicate us the dose and very easy 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.150
 to apply we fill it up to the level 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.550
 desired and diluted in irrigation water to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.250
 from here we proceed to water 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.200
 our plants normally the contribution 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.990
 of fertilizer we will do it every 15 days 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.550
 finally let's talk about light in 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.110
 First of all we have to take into account 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.450
 that the light that we will have is not the same 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.120
 in months like February March in the light that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.690
 will come in June July August in that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.250
 sense 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.459
 we should know a little more about him 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.110
 like our plant and from there 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.880
 locate it where they give more or less light 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.490
 we can also make use of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.530
 curtains blinds that give that light 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.570
 sifted similar to the one they receive in 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.400
 the places of origin as last 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.930
 just tell you that they are plants that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.390
 they do not like currents too much 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.610
 of air ie we should try not to 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.250
 place them in areas of passage or near 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.590
 doors or windows good with these 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.870
 tips you will see how you can have some 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.150
 healthy and beautiful plants and we encourage you to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.790
 that to that cultivate and enjoy it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.630
 of the color and the beauty they bring 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.630
 inside your homes
