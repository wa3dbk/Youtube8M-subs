00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.950 
a billion dollars a while back you know
so<00:01:42.130> if<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.790> look<00:01:42.969> at<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.390> way<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.780> doesn't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
so if you look at it that way it doesn't

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.200 
so if you look at it that way it doesn't
really<00:01:44.200> weigh<00:01:44.469> down<00:01:44.740> on<00:01:45.100> your<00:01:45.399> on<00:01:45.969> your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
really weigh down on your on your

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.789 
really weigh down on your on your
mindset<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.110> doesn't<00:01:47.350> really<00:01:47.439> screw<00:01:47.680> up

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
mindset and it doesn't really screw up

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.999 
mindset and it doesn't really screw up
your<00:01:47.950> mindset<00:01:48.250> but<00:01:48.880> if<00:01:48.969> you<00:01:49.060> look<00:01:49.270> at<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.570> like

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
your mindset but if you look at it like

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.639 
your mindset but if you look at it like
this<00:01:51.009> this<00:01:51.520> debt<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:51.880> me<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.719> know<00:01:52.750> equals<00:01:53.350> me

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
this this debt is me you know equals me

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.590 
this this debt is me you know equals me
that<00:01:53.920> kind<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.219> thing<00:01:54.399> if<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.610> identify<00:01:54.759> with

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
that kind of thing if you identify with

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.120 
that kind of thing if you identify with
it<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.380> becomes<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.740> problem<00:01:56.950> because

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
it then it becomes a problem because

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.249 
it then it becomes a problem because
your<00:01:57.520> entire<00:01:57.820> state<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.210> mind<00:01:58.420> becomes

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
your entire state of mind becomes

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.560 
your entire state of mind becomes
poisoned<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.039> becomes<00:02:00.280> tainted<00:02:00.579> by<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.360> and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
poisoned it becomes tainted by this and

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.010 
poisoned it becomes tainted by this and
that's<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.350> real<00:02:02.590> issue<00:02:02.619> okay<00:02:03.579> because<00:02:04.360> your

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
that's a real issue okay because your

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.330 
that's a real issue okay because your
state<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.259> mind<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.710> know<00:02:05.770> I've<00:02:05.950> said<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.280> a

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
state of mind I know I've said this a

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.800 
state of mind I know I've said this a
million<00:02:06.640> times<00:02:06.729> but<00:02:07.149> your<00:02:07.329> state<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.600> mind<00:02:07.750> is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
million times but your state of mind is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.270 
million times but your state of mind is
the<00:02:07.869> most<00:02:08.020> valuable<00:02:08.259> thing<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:09.039> it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the most valuable thing you have it

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.070 
the most valuable thing you have it
really<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.820> it<00:02:10.390> makes<00:02:10.630> all<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.930> difference

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
really is it makes all the difference

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.200 
really is it makes all the difference
because<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:12.040> know<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> lot<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.910> people<00:02:13.120> don't

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
because I know a lot of people don't

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.120 
because I know a lot of people don't
recognize<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.080> they<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:14.410> realize<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
recognize this they don't realize it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.880 
recognize this they don't realize it
because<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:16.360> subtle<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.290> effect<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.739> your

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
mindset has is very subtle but here's

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.020

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
these little decisions of course add up

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.910 
these little decisions of course add up

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
decisions you're going to look at things

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.090 
decisions you're going to look at things
in<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.350> different<00:03:10.440> way<00:03:10.650> you're<00:03:10.890> going<00:03:11.070> to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
in a different way you're going to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.070 
in a different way you're going to
recognize<00:03:11.640> opportunities<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.660> other<00:03:12.810> things

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
recognize opportunities and other things

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.560 
recognize opportunities and other things
that<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.040> had<00:03:14.220> another<00:03:14.520> mindset<00:03:14.910> you

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
that if you had another mindset you

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.270 
that if you had another mindset you
probably<00:03:16.050> wouldn't<00:03:16.350> do<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.680> that's<00:03:17.100> why<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
probably wouldn't do and that's why I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.370 
probably wouldn't do and that's why I
always<00:03:17.610> say<00:03:17.760> your<00:03:18.450> mindset<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.080> most

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
always say your mindset is the most

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.140 
always say your mindset is the most
valuable<00:03:19.530> thing<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.130> want<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.790> to

valuable thing you want you have to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.110 
valuable thing you want you have to

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
job you can't identify with that so you

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.630 
job you can't identify with that so you
have<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.500> see<00:04:22.650> these<00:04:22.830> situations<00:04:23.430> as

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
have to see these situations as

have to see these situations as
temporary<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.360> something<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.840> everyone

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
temporary and something that everyone

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350 
temporary and something that everyone
goes<00:04:25.620> through<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.550> you're<00:04:26.700> in<00:04:26.820> any<00:04:27.060> kind<00:04:27.180> of

situation like that it sounds

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.850 
situation like that it sounds
counterintuitive<00:04:29.970> your<00:04:30.600> first<00:04:30.930> reaction<00:04:31.650> is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
counterintuitive your first reaction is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.210 
counterintuitive your first reaction is
to<00:04:32.100> panic<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.090> try<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.750> cut<00:04:34.260> back<00:04:34.289> expenses

in as you can any way possible that's

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.860 
in as you can any way possible that's
sort<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.430> panic<00:04:41.760> response<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.660> have

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
sort of the panic response but you have

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.380 
sort of the panic response but you have

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
to move past that you have to make

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.030 
to move past that you have to make
priority<00:04:45.930> number<00:04:46.170> one<00:04:46.350> your<00:04:46.650> state<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.890> mind
