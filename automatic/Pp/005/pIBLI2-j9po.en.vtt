00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.050
 so staff you do not know anyone who does not stay anything also in Peru is with 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.989
 he patrick 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.209
 who has managed to conclude 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.209
 careers 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 I wish I had another team so what we wanted 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 how come you never played played in the country 3 to 2 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.520
 next game 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.960
 was himself 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 He attended the teaching of the little monkey. The coup cut today. I'm black. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.229
 this is not stretched the attack 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.269
 this is of the opinion that it had an accent that one has to be reopened the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.590
 patric 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.540
 was the first of the group 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 as mere fun there 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.630
 and treatment 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.170
 but the problem with him was a credit because I came from the elite atalanta in bologna 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.940
 for this purpose, which is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.610
 public server 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 when the substitute after the defeat before the bay 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 because 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.960
 Why google to the public 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.920
 both your ticket 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.870
 the other game that gave the team 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.460
 credits and the sealant thousand among the products that we have reports of doubting 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 his 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.469
 the director his practices Maria Claudia who is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.939
 so the game 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.180
 which is not to be confused with the game 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.560
 he was injured 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.960
 this is the worst attack in Kabul month 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 I stayed 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.930
 why that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.470
 risk behaviors 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340
 discovered that this article 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 al qaeda 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.399
 It is important that the
