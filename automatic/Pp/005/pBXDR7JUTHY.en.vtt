show you how to make the butterfly using

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.780 
show you how to make the butterfly using
a<00:00:06.450> regular<00:00:06.810> sheet<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.350> printer<00:00:07.740> paper<00:00:07.919> if<00:00:08.280> you

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
a regular sheet of printer paper if you

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
a regular sheet of printer paper if you
have<00:00:09.000> origami<00:00:09.330> paper<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:10.019> will<00:00:10.139> work<00:00:10.290> fine

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
have origami paper that will work fine

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.129 
have origami paper that will work fine
also<00:00:11.000> what<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.090> need<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.809> need<00:00:12.929> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
also what we need to do is we need to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.039 
also what we need to do is we need to
make<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.769> printer<00:00:14.190> paper<00:00:14.340> into<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> square<00:00:15.509> so

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
make the printer paper into a square so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.519 
make the printer paper into a square so
we<00:00:16.770> take<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.340> corner<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.449> fold<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.199> down

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
we take this corner and we fold it down

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250 
we take this corner and we fold it down
onto<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.250> side<00:00:20.520> until<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.300> edge<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
onto this side until this edge here is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.820 
onto this side until this edge here is
aligned<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.490> edge<00:00:24.199> make<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> crease<00:00:25.560> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
aligned with this edge make a crease and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.359 
aligned with this edge make a crease and
you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.130> cut<00:00:26.310> off<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> excess<00:00:26.670> paper<00:00:31.369> now

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you can cut off the excess paper now

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
you can cut off the excess paper now
that<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.239> piece<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> square<00:00:34.050> paper

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that we have a piece of square paper

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
that we have a piece of square paper
that<00:00:34.649> has<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> diagonal<00:00:35.250> fold<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> going

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that has a diagonal fold in it going

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
that has a diagonal fold in it going
this<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.200> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.469> take<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.829> corner<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this way we want to take this corner and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
this way we want to take this corner and
fold<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.570> corner<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.730> try<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
fold it down to this corner and try to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.479 
fold it down to this corner and try to
be<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:42.960> neat<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.379> possible<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
be as neat as possible so now if you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790 
be as neat as possible so now if you
open<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> paper<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.480> should<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.079> an<00:00:52.410> X

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
open up the paper you should have an X

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
open up the paper you should have an X
in<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.930> take<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
in it now what we do is we take the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
in it now what we do is we take the
paper<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.829> fold<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.309> half<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
paper and we fold it in half going this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.209 
paper and we fold it in half going this
way<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.809> taking<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.289> edge<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> aligning<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
way by taking this edge and aligning it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:08.300 
way by taking this edge and aligning it
with<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.489> edge<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:03.979> you<00:01:04.979> make<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> crease<00:01:07.310> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
with this edge and you make a crease so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.000 
with this edge and you make a crease so
now<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> open<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.320> should<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:10.770> X

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
now if you open it you should have an X

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.390 
now if you open it you should have an X
and<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.909> horizontal<00:01:12.299> line<00:01:12.810> once<00:01:13.770> again<00:01:13.860> fold<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and a horizontal line once again fold it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.850 
and a horizontal line once again fold it
on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> horizontal<00:01:15.270> line<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.780> sure<00:01:16.590> it's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
on the horizontal line make sure it's

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
on the horizontal line make sure it's
nice<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> flat<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
nice and flat now what we want to do is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.399 
nice and flat now what we want to do is
we<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> lift<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.119> first<00:01:21.570> layer<00:01:22.020> here

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
we want to lift up this first layer here

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.410 
we want to lift up this first layer here
and<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> tuck<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.700> corner<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and we want to tuck this corner in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.530 
and we want to tuck this corner in
towards<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> center<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.939> model<00:01:26.939> where<00:01:27.390> my

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
towards the center of the model where my

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
towards the center of the model where my
thumb<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.040> lift<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> first<00:01:29.490> layer<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
thumb is lift up the first layer and you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.910 
thumb is lift up the first layer and you
tuck<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> corner<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
tuck the corner in just like that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.440 
tuck the corner in just like that
and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> fold<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:36.079> good<00:01:37.079> creases

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
and then you fold and make good creases

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
and then you fold and make good creases
do<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> left<00:01:40.259> side<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.740> lift<00:01:40.920> up

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
do the same for the left side so lift up

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.880 
do the same for the left side so lift up
the<00:01:41.189> first<00:01:41.430> sheet<00:01:41.670> tuck<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> corner<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.700> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the first sheet tuck the corner in and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.190 
the first sheet tuck the corner in and
then<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> make<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.220> creases<00:01:47.610> again<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:52.049> now

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
then you make the creases again so now

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810 
then you make the creases again so now
you<00:01:52.259> should<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.710> model<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> looks<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you should have a model that looks just

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
you should have a model that looks just
like<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> known<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
like this and this is known as the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.730 
like this and this is known as the
waterbomb<00:01:56.759> base<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> paper<00:01:58.020> balloon<00:01:58.439> base

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
waterbomb base or the paper balloon base

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
waterbomb base or the paper balloon base
now<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> proper<00:02:00.090> base<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> make

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
now that we have the proper base to make

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.300 
now that we have the proper base to make
the<00:02:00.840> butterfly<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.710> should<00:02:01.920> notice<00:02:02.280> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the butterfly you should notice that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
the butterfly you should notice that
there<00:02:02.640> are<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:03.180> top<00:02:03.540> flaps<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> two<00:02:04.740> bottom

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
there are two top flaps and two bottom

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.130 
there are two top flaps and two bottom
flaps<00:02:05.399> what<00:02:06.299> we're<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.990> we're

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
flaps what we're going to do is we're

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
flaps what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.350> take<00:02:07.590> both<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> top<00:02:08.429> flaps<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
going to take both of the top flaps and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.780 
going to take both of the top flaps and
as<00:02:09.750> you'll<00:02:09.989> notice<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.440> has<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> point<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.250> we

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
as you'll notice it has a point here we

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370 
as you'll notice it has a point here we
want<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> put<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.480> point<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
want to put this point on the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.100 
want to put this point on the
of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> triangle<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.840> when<00:02:15.840> we're<00:02:15.990> doing

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
of the triangle and when we're doing

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.380 
of the triangle and when we're doing
that<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.830> edge<00:02:17.220> will<00:02:17.640> align<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.030> this

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that this edge will align with this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.920 
that this edge will align with this
outer<00:02:18.630> edge<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> triangle<00:02:19.890> also<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.510> point

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
outer edge of the triangle also so point

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.520 
outer edge of the triangle also so point
it<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> top<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.350> make<00:02:25.500> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it to the top and then we can make a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.150 
it to the top and then we can make a
crease<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.530> should<00:02:28.710> have<00:02:28.740> something<00:02:29.040> that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
crease so you should have something that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.800 
crease so you should have something that
looks<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.120> we're<00:02:30.330> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.690> do

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
looks like this and we're going to do

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.750 
looks like this and we're going to do
the<00:02:30.930> same<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.770> other<00:02:31.920> top<00:02:32.190> flat<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the same with the other top flat and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.450 
the same with the other top flat and
make<00:02:38.760> another<00:02:38.970> crease<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.190> should<00:02:41.340> have

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
make another crease so you should have

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.220 
make another crease so you should have
something<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.910> looks<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.690> this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
something that looks just like this

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.470 
something that looks just like this
now<00:02:43.830> we're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.610> flip<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.030> model<00:02:45.060> over

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
now we're going to flip the model over

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
now we're going to flip the model over
and<00:02:45.810> we're<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.890> take<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.370> bottom<00:02:47.610> of

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
and we're going to take the bottom of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 
and we're going to take the bottom of
the<00:02:48.240> triangle<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.990> fold<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.440> towards<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.890> top

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the triangle and fold it towards the top

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.010 
the triangle and fold it towards the top
but<00:02:50.850> we're<00:02:51.030> not<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.390> fold<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.810> all<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
but we're not going to fold it all the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.170 
but we're not going to fold it all the
way<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.770> point<00:02:53.010> we're<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.970> leave

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
way up to the point we're going to leave

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
way up to the point we're going to leave
a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.660> bit<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.960> overhang<00:02:55.500> about<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.160> width

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
a little bit of overhang about the width

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.900 
a little bit of overhang about the width
of<00:02:56.580> your<00:02:56.670> thumb<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.440> take<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.830> bottom<00:02:59.160> fold<00:02:59.760> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
of your thumb so take the bottom fold it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.730 
of your thumb so take the bottom fold it
towards<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.330> top<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.990> like<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:06.740> leave

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
towards the top just like that and leave

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.950 
towards the top just like that and leave
about<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.430> thumb<00:03:09.390> width<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.950> overhang<00:03:11.870> once<00:03:12.870> you

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
about a thumb width of overhang once you

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.450 
about a thumb width of overhang once you
have<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.230> around<00:03:13.440> there<00:03:13.710> then<00:03:14.070> we're<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
have it around there then we're going to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.670 
have it around there then we're going to
crease<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.030> bottom<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> model<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
crease the bottom of the model all the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.410 
crease the bottom of the model all the
way<00:03:17.070> across<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.850> should<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.150> something

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
way across so you should have something

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.810 
way across so you should have something
that<00:03:21.600> looks<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.800> now<00:03:23.610> we're

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
that looks just like this now we're

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.740 
that looks just like this now we're
going<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.060> flip<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.480> model<00:03:24.510> over<00:03:24.930> again<00:03:25.380> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
going to flip the model over again and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.270 
going to flip the model over again and
now<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.780> should<00:03:28.140> see<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.920> are<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
now you should see that here are the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.040 
now you should see that here are the
tips<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.000> flaps<00:03:30.300> which<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.780> previously

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
tips of the flaps which we previously

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.650 
tips of the flaps which we previously
folded<00:03:31.620> up<00:03:31.920> towards<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> top<00:03:32.450> now<00:03:33.450> we're

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
folded up towards the top now we're

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.570 
folded up towards the top now we're
going<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.930> bring<00:03:34.320> them<00:03:34.530> down<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:35.160> by<00:03:35.310> pulling

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
going to bring them down just by pulling

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.000 
going to bring them down just by pulling
on<00:03:35.790> them<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.590> when<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.710> do<00:03:37.830> that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
on them like that when you do that

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.620 
on them like that when you do that
you'll<00:03:38.190> see<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.670> won't<00:03:38.910> go<00:03:39.090> down

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
you'll see that it won't go down

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.780 
you'll see that it won't go down
because<00:03:40.020> it<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.440> being<00:03:40.680> held<00:03:40.980> by<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.550> edge

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
because it is being held by this edge

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.720 
because it is being held by this edge
here<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:43.110> what<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.830> do<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.400> fold

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
here so what you have to do is just fold

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.600 
here so what you have to do is just fold
it<00:03:44.880> down<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:46.440> edge<00:03:46.710> should<00:03:47.040> start<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.490> go

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
it down and this edge should start to go

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.630 
it down and this edge should start to go
towards<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.060> center<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.540> model<00:03:49.610> when<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
towards the center of the model when it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.020 
towards the center of the model when it
does<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.480> push<00:03:51.810> down<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.820> then<00:03:53.820> make

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
does just push down on it and then make

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.890 
does just push down on it and then make
a<00:03:54.060> good<00:03:54.360> crease<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.930> flatten<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.350> out<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:59.900> do

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
a good crease to flatten it out and do

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.260 
a good crease to flatten it out and do
the<00:04:01.020> same<00:04:01.260> with<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> left<00:04:01.770> side<00:04:02.240> bring<00:04:03.240> it

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
the same with the left side bring it

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.150 
the same with the left side bring it
down

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.820 

and<00:04:07.450> just<00:04:08.450> flatten<00:04:08.750> out<00:04:09.020> that<00:04:09.230> hood<00:04:09.470> there

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.860 

just<00:04:15.830> like<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.300> then<00:04:17.300> we're<00:04:17.480> going<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.690> flip

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
just like that then we're going to flip

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.590 
just like that then we're going to flip
the<00:04:18.110> model<00:04:18.290> over<00:04:18.560> again<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:20.120> time<00:04:20.420> we're

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
the model over again and this time we're

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.870 
the model over again and this time we're
going<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.840> make<00:04:21.110> the<00:04:21.320> head<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.640> going

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
going to make the head so this is going

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.850 
going to make the head so this is going
to<00:04:22.970> be<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.210> head<00:04:23.390> what<00:04:24.170> we<00:04:24.260> want<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.530> do<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.770> we

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
to be the head what we want to do is we

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.950 
to be the head what we want to do is we
want<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.130> fold<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.550> all<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.790> way<00:04:26.090> down<00:04:26.600> as<00:04:26.930> far

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
want to fold it all the way down as far

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.440 
want to fold it all the way down as far
as<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.470> can<00:04:27.620> go<00:04:27.680> which<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.370> basically<00:04:28.880> on<00:04:29.120> this

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
as it can go which is basically on this

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.410 
as it can go which is basically on this
edge<00:04:29.720> here<00:04:30.220> fold<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.370> down<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:34.120> make<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.150> crease

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
edge here fold it down and make a crease

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.840 
edge here fold it down and make a crease
then<00:04:36.260> we're<00:04:36.410> going<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.650> fold<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.130> up<00:04:37.220> just<00:04:37.700> a

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
then we're going to fold it up just a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.250 
then we're going to fold it up just a
little<00:04:37.880> bit<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.720> there's<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.930> little<00:04:39.140> bit

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
little bit so that there's a little bit

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.460 
little bit so that there's a little bit
of<00:04:39.380> overhang<00:04:39.920> on<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.220> other<00:04:40.340> side<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:42.020> fold<00:04:42.350> it

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
of overhang on the other side so fold it

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.010 
of overhang on the other side so fold it
up<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:43.460> about<00:04:43.640> like<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:46.840> as<00:04:47.840> you'll

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
up just about like that and as you'll

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.600 
up just about like that and as you'll
see<00:04:48.050> there's<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.380> little<00:04:48.710> bit<00:04:48.830> overhang<00:04:49.250> on<00:04:49.520> the

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
see there's a little bit overhang on the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.140 
see there's a little bit overhang on the
other<00:04:49.730> side<00:04:51.550> so<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.640> should<00:04:52.820> have<00:04:52.940> something

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
other side so you should have something

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.490 
other side so you should have something
that<00:04:53.300> looks<00:04:53.540> just<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:53.960> this

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that looks just like this

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.470 
that looks just like this
okay<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.190> we're<00:04:55.490> pretty<00:04:55.820> much<00:04:55.970> done<00:04:56.210> with<00:04:56.390> the

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
okay so we're pretty much done with the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.060 
okay so we're pretty much done with the
butterfly<00:04:56.840> we<00:04:56.990> just<00:04:57.170> have<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.380> fold<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.830> wings

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
butterfly we just have to fold the wings

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.950 
butterfly we just have to fold the wings
and<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.760> do<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.060> what<00:04:59.270> we're<00:04:59.390> going<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.630> do<00:04:59.810> is

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
and to do that what we're going to do is

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.750 
and to do that what we're going to do is
you're<00:05:00.050> going<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.260> take<00:05:00.500> both<00:05:00.530> halves<00:05:01.220> of<00:05:01.520> the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
you're going to take both halves of the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.510 
you're going to take both halves of the
butterfly<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.450> fold<00:05:03.080> them<00:05:03.320> down<00:05:03.350> away<00:05:04.280> from

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
butterfly and fold them down away from

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.120 
butterfly and fold them down away from
us<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.110> want<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.320> fold<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.620> butterfly<00:05:06.980> in

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
us so you want to fold the butterfly in

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.100 
us so you want to fold the butterfly in
half<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.550> way<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:10.720> we're<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:11.810> going<00:05:12.020> to

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
half this way and we're just going to

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.190 
half this way and we're just going to
make<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.410> crease<00:05:12.800> along<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:13.820> edge<00:05:14.120> here<00:05:17.200> okay

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
make a crease along this edge here okay

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.460 
make a crease along this edge here okay
now<00:05:18.410> what<00:05:18.620> we<00:05:18.740> want<00:05:18.950> to<00:05:19.010> do<00:05:19.220> is<00:05:19.900> if<00:05:20.900> you'll<00:05:21.140> see

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
now what we want to do is if you'll see

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.390 
now what we want to do is if you'll see
there<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.310> an<00:05:22.670> imaginary<00:05:22.940> line<00:05:23.390> from<00:05:24.350> here<00:05:24.770> to

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
there is an imaginary line from here to

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.450 
there is an imaginary line from here to
here<00:05:26.050> let<00:05:27.050> me<00:05:27.080> draw<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.380> line<00:05:27.650> just<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:28.370> you

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
here let me draw a line just so you

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:36.330 
here let me draw a line just so you
could<00:05:28.610> see<00:05:28.760> what<00:05:28.850> I'm<00:05:28.940> talking<00:05:29.300> about<00:05:29.330> right

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.740 

along<00:05:37.340> there<00:05:37.640> where<00:05:38.120> it<00:05:38.210> leaves<00:05:38.420> from<00:05:38.600> the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
along there where it leaves from the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.140 
along there where it leaves from the
bottom<00:05:39.200> of<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.500> body<00:05:39.740> here<00:05:40.310> up<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:40.970> edge

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
bottom of the body here up to the edge

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.290 
bottom of the body here up to the edge
of<00:05:41.480> the<00:05:41.660> where<00:05:42.170> the<00:05:42.350> head<00:05:42.620> was<00:05:42.890> and<00:05:43.250> what<00:05:44.180> you

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
of the where the head was and what you

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.570 
of the where the head was and what you
want<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.510> do<00:05:44.720> is<00:05:44.930> you<00:05:45.380> want<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.620> fold<00:05:45.890> upwards

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
want to do is you want to fold upwards

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.560 
want to do is you want to fold upwards
along<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.300> line<00:05:48.790> so<00:05:49.790> fold<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.360> wings

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
along that line so fold the wings

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.210 
along that line so fold the wings
upwards<00:05:51.200> on<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:52.610> line<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:56.710> do<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.830> same<00:05:58.010> for

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
upwards on that line and do the same for

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.689 
upwards on that line and do the same for
the<00:05:58.310> other<00:05:58.430> side

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.510 

and<00:06:07.110> then<00:06:08.110> just<00:06:08.289> make<00:06:08.469> creases<00:06:08.949> along<00:06:09.340> the

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
and then just make creases along the

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.129 
and then just make creases along the
base<00:06:09.699> here<00:06:10.000> on<00:06:10.210> these<00:06:10.479> edges<00:06:10.719> and<00:06:13.050> then<00:06:14.050> all

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
base here on these edges and then all

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.490 
base here on these edges and then all
you<00:06:14.259> have<00:06:14.409> to<00:06:14.439> do<00:06:14.650> is<00:06:14.949> you<00:06:15.159> just<00:06:15.280> want<00:06:15.460> to<00:06:15.520> fold

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
you have to do is you just want to fold

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.749 
you have to do is you just want to fold
you<00:06:17.500> want<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:17.740> fold<00:06:18.009> these<00:06:18.430> wings<00:06:19.500> so<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:20.759> the

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 
you want to fold these wings so that the

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.040 
you want to fold these wings so that the
edge<00:06:21.909> of<00:06:22.210> it<00:06:22.330> when<00:06:22.509> you're<00:06:22.599> folding<00:06:22.810> it<00:06:22.990> down

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
edge of it when you're folding it down

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.439 
edge of it when you're folding it down
is<00:06:23.469> pretty<00:06:23.949> much<00:06:24.099> in<00:06:24.310> line<00:06:24.639> with<00:06:24.909> the<00:06:25.030> top<00:06:25.270> of

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
is pretty much in line with the top of

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.689 
is pretty much in line with the top of
the<00:06:25.569> body<00:06:25.780> so<00:06:26.770> if<00:06:26.919> you<00:06:27.009> look<00:06:27.159> at<00:06:27.280> it<00:06:27.400> sideways

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
the body so if you look at it sideways

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:29.640 
the body so if you look at it sideways
it<00:06:28.180> should<00:06:28.389> kind<00:06:28.539> of<00:06:28.659> be<00:06:28.780> lined<00:06:29.169> up<00:06:29.379> with<00:06:29.439> the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
it should kind of be lined up with the

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.580 
it should kind of be lined up with the
body<00:06:30.419> kind<00:06:31.419> of<00:06:31.509> fold<00:06:31.780> it<00:06:31.900> straight<00:06:32.020> down<00:06:32.349> like

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
body kind of fold it straight down like

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:40.529 
body kind of fold it straight down like
that<00:06:36.389> and<00:06:38.490> just<00:06:39.490> make<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.699> crease<00:06:40.029> along<00:06:40.389> the

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
that and just make a crease along the

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.260 
that and just make a crease along the
wings<00:06:40.750> and<00:06:41.279> then<00:06:42.279> just<00:06:42.490> pull<00:06:42.729> on<00:06:42.759> it<00:06:43.029> a<00:06:43.090> little

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
wings and then just pull on it a little

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.769 
wings and then just pull on it a little
bit<00:06:43.449> and<00:06:44.580> there<00:06:45.580> you<00:06:45.699> go<00:06:45.879> you<00:06:45.939> are<00:06:46.150> done<00:06:46.569> with

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779
