00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.299
 very good to all I'm going to put a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.969
 background gameplay of the rais in which 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 you will see what I am throwing in iron 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:13.380
 towards the beverage machines ago 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 months a subscriber told me that if you 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.280
 strips on plates of drinks te 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.030
 they will give points and I, I said, you are 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.180
 drugged and effectively works well 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.890
 well I do not know what pattern follows because there is a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 Sometimes you throw yourself and they do not give you I think 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
 goes in an order that is first you 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 you have to throw in one then in another 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 then another and you are given 25 points 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 25 points 25 points 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.070
 I think he only gives you one drink once 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.450
 and it's a little curiosity you'll see in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.629
 the gameplay that gives it to me I think you're 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.790
 pete tail and the double shot and I do not know if the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.820
 cuatri by also takes me to give you 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.640
 is giving 25 points in 25 points because no 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.019
 you will see the background gameplay and how 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 curiosity is not bad 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.650
 I suppose some of you would already have 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.210
 that you do not know, you can look at the 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.760
 first rounds if you want some 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.739
 extra points for thirÃ¡is en plancha 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.259
 towards any drink that has 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.990
 by the map in this case in the rise what 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.840
 I have done and it actually works 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.369
 you already know one thing once the same 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.369
 I leave with the gameplay and see you later 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 the correction of santis 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.880
 Y 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.290
 because this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.910
 great teacher 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.280
 maximum condition 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.799
 for all comrades 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.470
 wisely 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.040
 but 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.250
 do not fuck 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.230
 with the drunks when they return home 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.260
 time to take a break
