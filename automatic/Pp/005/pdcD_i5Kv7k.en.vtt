so<00:00:01.380> here's<00:00:01.589> print<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.159> 3ds<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.820> mention<00:00:03.179> SST

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
so here's print to 3ds to mention SST

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.610 
so here's print to 3ds to mention SST
1200<00:00:05.310> ES<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.480> have<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> one<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.319> panels

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
1200 ES and I have a one of the panels

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.049 
1200 ES and I have a one of the panels
off<00:00:07.740> right<00:00:07.950> now<00:00:08.069> for<00:00:08.309> some<00:00:08.460> maintenance<00:00:08.700> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
off right now for some maintenance I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
off right now for some maintenance I
already<00:00:09.269> got<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.599> me<00:00:09.719> it's<00:00:09.960> done<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.920> figured

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
already got to me it's done so I figured

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
already got to me it's done so I figured
I'd<00:00:11.280> make<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.400> little<00:00:11.519> video<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:12.120> how<00:00:12.960> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I'd make a little video on how this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.860 
I'd make a little video on how this
machine<00:00:13.380> works<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.210> mostly<00:00:15.480> now<00:00:15.690> right

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
machine works so as mostly now right

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.269 
machine works so as mostly now right
here<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> control<00:00:16.350> panel<00:00:16.830> which<00:00:17.010> really

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
here is the control panel which really

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.550 
here is the control panel which really
isn't<00:00:17.430> interesting<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.779> I'll<00:00:18.930> help<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> door

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
isn't interesting so I'll help the door

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.890 
isn't interesting so I'll help the door
here<00:00:20.119> that's<00:00:21.119> most<00:00:21.300> people<00:00:21.480> know<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
here that's most people know this is a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
build tray this back here is a bend to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.710 
build tray this back here is a bend to
collect<00:00:25.010> scrap<00:00:26.010> pieces<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> filament<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
collect scrap pieces of filament and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
collect scrap pieces of filament and
when<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> tip<00:00:28.380> cleans<00:00:29.160> out<00:00:30.800> up<00:00:31.800> here's<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
when the tip cleans out up here's the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.959 
when the tip cleans out up here's the
printhead<00:00:33.050> take<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> cover<00:00:34.350> off<00:00:34.500> here

let's here support extrusion tip - here

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.959 
let's here support extrusion tip - here
is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> model<00:00:39.390> fusion<00:00:40.379> tip<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
is the model fusion tip this here is the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.360 
is the model fusion tip this here is the
feed<00:00:42.239> pulley<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:43.710> feeds<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> filament<00:00:46.370> into

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
feed pulley it feeds the filament into

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.639

as<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.190> haul<00:00:50.600> head<00:00:51.600> assembly

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
as you can see this haul head assembly

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.520 
as you can see this haul head assembly
pivots<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.930> through<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.289> little

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
pivots and it's just through this little

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970 
pivots and it's just through this little
bar<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.559> model

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
bar here so right now it's in model

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.560 
bar here so right now it's in model
extrusion<00:00:59.399> mode<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:02.270> gets<00:01:03.270> head

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
extrusion mode and when this gets head

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.880 
extrusion mode and when this gets head
and<00:01:04.350> it'll<00:01:04.530> tip<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:06.330> tip<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> can

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and it'll tip this and this tip so I can

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.050 
and it'll tip this and this tip so I can
do<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> support<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
do the support because right now the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.289 
do the support because right now the
model<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.900> lower<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.250> reach<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.670> model

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
model is lower so I can reach the model

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.340 
model is lower so I can reach the model

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
little rod here I'm not sure if you can

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.270 
little rod here I'm not sure if you can
even<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:30.650> guess<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> can't<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> little

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
even see that I guess you can't a little

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
even see that I guess you can't a little
bit<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.259> here<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.500> that

down here is the cartridges this here's

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.130 
down here is the cartridges this here's
the<00:01:41.980> model<00:01:42.370> cartridge<00:01:42.760> this<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> support

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
the model cartridge this is the support

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.500 
the model cartridge this is the support
cartridge<00:01:44.590> now<00:01:45.220> how<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:45.490> works<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.120> have<00:01:46.480> a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510
