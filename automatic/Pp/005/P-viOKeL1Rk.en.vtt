 is or whether it is still only 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.909
 then we have a wine 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.110
 I am very excited about it very much 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.220
 that is peter lauer almost 31 of that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.659
 we have one in the past 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.890
 have heard a lot and 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.610
 probably much more in the future 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.190
 to hear 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.810
 very interesting and of course not last 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.640
 Someone already leases it here 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.570
 a guest was matthias 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.550
 mayer out of boxes and a man i 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.290
 very much appreciate because a very clear and 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.140
 especially in a very entertaining way 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.210
 to do that or present it 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.310
 I called him and said something 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.510
 my age i am of course in the vineyard 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.250
 So somebody really tangible 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.580
 this package works these three 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.100
 Bottles included including the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.690
 shipping in germany costs 32 90 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.190
 and therefore have a bit too 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.180
 you try to correspond to what is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.350
 many have also wanted 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.630
 maybe a package a bit 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.810
 it is cheaper that is three I cry 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.460
 think that's quite a fair price for it 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.800
 and above all things like future 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.420
 entertainment have again very short 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.980

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.840
 interactive you really have it 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.300
 required 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.160
 great questions have been there 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 great dynamics developed here in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.730
 wakfu so people it can go on 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.140
 technically I have to say we are 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.999
 yes, already quite nice step 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.859
 That's why this one again 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.140
 I prefer to wait many thanks 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.000
 for your support 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.640
 sharing is gehring so tell it 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.900
 it tells your friends if 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.430
 you're on this format 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.500
 And I think even more fun in the glass 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.430
 At the moment you can not stay here then 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.020
 buy a package 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.970
 and who does not but that does not have it 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.770
 also not bad you can wonderful 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.480
 learn a lot or even in reload 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.860

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.700

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.980

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.010
 I think weekend is coming up 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.540
 This time we do not have to go against it 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.920
 any football clubs compete 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.959
 probably only against weekend so 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.730
