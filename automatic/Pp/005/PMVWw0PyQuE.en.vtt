hi<00:00:01.140> my<00:00:01.380> Christ<00:00:01.650> Penn<00:00:01.920> brain<00:00:02.129> manager<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:02.700> to

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi my Christ Penn brain manager here to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.220 
hi my Christ Penn brain manager here to
talk<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.360> fathom<00:00:03.780> lever<00:00:03.990> drag

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
talk to you about the fathom lever drag

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.860 
talk to you about the fathom lever drag
to<00:00:04.529> speed<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> past<00:00:06.150> few<00:00:06.420> years<00:00:06.509> we've

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to speed so in the past few years we've

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.600 
to speed so in the past few years we've
launched<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.319> fathom<00:00:07.710> level<00:00:07.980> line<00:00:08.130> then<00:00:08.429> we<00:00:08.519> had

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
launched a fathom level line then we had

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.730 
launched a fathom level line then we had
the<00:00:08.700> fathom<00:00:09.030> star<00:00:09.240> drag<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:10.410> year<00:00:10.620> we're

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the fathom star drag this year we're

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.290 
the fathom star drag this year we're
bringing<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> fathom<00:00:11.700> lever<00:00:12.000> direct

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
bringing out a fathom lever direct

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.450 
bringing out a fathom lever direct
two-speed<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:13.799> look<00:00:13.889> at<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.070> sizing

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
two-speed so let's look at the sizing

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.859 
two-speed so let's look at the sizing
real<00:00:14.580> quick<00:00:14.790> we've<00:00:14.940> got<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> 15<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.870> 25<00:00:15.990> n<00:00:17.000> 30<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
real quick we've got a 15 a 25 n 30 the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.109 
real quick we've got a 15 a 25 n 30 the
40<00:00:19.140> N<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> N<00:00:19.920> stands<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.609> an<00:00:20.699> arrow<00:00:20.850> so

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
40 N and the N stands for an arrow so

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
40 N and the N stands for an arrow so
think<00:00:21.420> narrow<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.170> taller<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.160> spool<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
think narrow and taller on the spool and

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.599 
think narrow and taller on the spool and
then<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> 60<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> remember<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.189> pin

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
then we have the 60 and remember on pin

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
then we have the 60 and remember on pin
conventional<00:00:27.090> reels<00:00:27.269> model<00:00:28.260> number

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
conventional reels model number

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.830 
conventional reels model number
correlates<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> line<00:00:29.640> capacity<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> 60

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
correlates to line capacity so the 60

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
correlates to line capacity so the 60
holds<00:00:31.140> 300<00:00:31.529> yards<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> 60<00:00:32.070> pound<00:00:32.189> mono<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.149> 15

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
holds 300 yards a 60 pound mono the 15

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.370 
holds 300 yards a 60 pound mono the 15
holds<00:00:33.960> 300<00:00:34.410> yards<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.860> 15<00:00:35.219> pound<00:00:35.489> Mona<00:00:36.170> okay<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
holds 300 yards of 15 pound Mona okay so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
holds 300 yards of 15 pound Mona okay so
just<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> other<00:00:38.370> fathom<00:00:38.790> reels

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
just like all the other fathom reels

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.260 
just like all the other fathom reels
black<00:00:39.660> satin<00:00:40.230> finish<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.579> fooled<00:00:41.879> it's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
black satin finish don't be fooled it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
black satin finish don't be fooled it's
not<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:43.170> people<00:00:43.410> refer<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.829> graphite

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
not what people refer to as graphite

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.350 
not what people refer to as graphite
this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:44.910> all-metal<00:00:45.360> body<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.079> side<00:00:46.379> plate

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
this is an all-metal body and side plate

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.430 
this is an all-metal body and side plate
when<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> say<00:00:48.570> body<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:48.930> talking<00:00:49.200> about<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
when I say body I'm talking about the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.990 
when I say body I'm talking about the
frame<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:49.920> we've<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.579> metal<00:00:50.850> side

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
frame here so we've got two metal side

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
frame here so we've got two metal side
plates<00:00:51.270> metal<00:00:51.870> frame<00:00:52.079> die<00:00:52.530> cast<00:00:52.829> aluminum

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

very solid construction not machined
aluminum<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
aluminum like we use on the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
aluminum like we use on the
internationals<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> torque<00:01:00.030> rails<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
internationals and the torque rails this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.590

is die cast aluminum you can see here on
the<00:01:03.719> spool<00:01:03.989> we've<00:01:04.379> added<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> line<00:01:04.860> capacity

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the spool we've added the line capacity

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
the spool we've added the line capacity
rings<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> other<00:01:06.630> pin

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
rings like we do on all the other pin

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.260 
rings like we do on all the other pin
wheels<00:01:07.080> inside<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> reel<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> our<00:01:08.790> rack

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
wheels inside the reel we go to our rack

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 
wheels inside the reel we go to our rack
system<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.960> our<00:01:10.140> proprietary<00:01:10.439> top<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
system so this is our proprietary top of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
system so this is our proprietary top of
the<00:01:11.580> line<00:01:11.790> drag<00:01:12.360> material<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.930> use<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.260> our

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the line drag material we use it in our

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
the line drag material we use it in our
internationals<00:01:14.010> torque<00:01:14.880> lever<00:01:15.119> drags<00:01:15.450> we're

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
internationals torque lever drags we're

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
internationals torque lever drags we're
also<00:01:15.780> using<00:01:16.049> our<00:01:16.200> squall<00:01:16.560> lever<00:01:16.799> drags<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
also using our squall lever drags the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
also using our squall lever drags the
fathom<00:01:18.450> uses<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> dirt<00:01:19.049> dry<00:01:19.290> material<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
fathom uses the dirt dry material and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
fathom uses the dirt dry material and
that's<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.250> also<00:01:20.520> grease<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.150> dura<00:01:21.420> loop

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that's that's also grease with dura loop

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.859 
that's that's also grease with dura loop
so<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.930> what<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.229> call<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> wet<00:01:22.680> drag<00:01:22.979> system

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
so it's what we call a wet drag system

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
so it's what we call a wet drag system
when<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.680> guts<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> reel

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
when we go to the the guts of the reel

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.569 
when we go to the the guts of the reel
the<00:01:27.299> quick<00:01:27.810> shift<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.380> speed<00:01:28.650> system<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.250> right

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the quick shift to speed system is right

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.310 
the quick shift to speed system is right
here<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.970> that's<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.570> engages<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
here and that's what engages and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.170 
here and that's what engages and
disengages<00:01:31.350> high<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> low<00:01:32.430> gear<00:01:32.640> inside<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
disengages high and low gear inside the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.340 
disengages high and low gear inside the
reel<00:01:33.299> we'll<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> gears<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> minute

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
reel we'll look at the gears in a minute

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
reel we'll look at the gears in a minute
but<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> push<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> quick<00:01:36.240> shift<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
but you know you push the quick shift in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
but you know you push the quick shift in
to<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.900> into<00:01:37.110> low<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.920> pop<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to go into low you pop it out to go to
