00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
also a like 95 power bat so

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.779 
also a like 95 power bat so
as<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.539> nine<00:02:09.020> hitter<00:02:09.349> you<00:02:09.679> really<00:02:10.220> can't<00:02:10.520> get

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
as a nine hitter you really can't get

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
much better than that but look at this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.059 
much better than that but look at this
