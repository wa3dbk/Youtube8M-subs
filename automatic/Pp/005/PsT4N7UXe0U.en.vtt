arguments<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> form<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.889> own<00:00:14.040> point<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.519> view

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
arguments to form your own point of view

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.269 
arguments to form your own point of view
so<00:00:15.450> identifying<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.320> understanding<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
so identifying and understanding the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.400 
so identifying and understanding the
main<00:00:17.430> argument<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.090> an<00:00:18.330> important<00:00:18.869> academic

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
main argument is an important academic

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.279 
main argument is an important academic
skill<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.939> argument<00:00:21.359> although

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
skill so what is an argument although

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
skill so what is an argument although
academics<00:00:23.039> sometimes<00:00:23.430> disagree<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:24.150> argument

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
academics sometimes disagree an argument

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.259 
academics sometimes disagree an argument
is<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> fight<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:26.070> academic<00:00:26.640> literature<00:00:26.970> an

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
is not a fight in academic literature an

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
is not a fight in academic literature an
argument<00:00:27.900> involves<00:00:28.320> expressing<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.070> point<00:00:29.340> of

argument involves expressing a point of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.060 
argument involves expressing a point of
view<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> topic<00:00:30.420> or<00:00:30.539> issue<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.170> supporting

it<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.189> evidence

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it with evidence

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.880 
it with evidence
the<00:00:33.329> main<00:00:33.510> argument<00:00:33.750> consists<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> three

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the main argument consists of three

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910 
the main argument consists of three
things<00:00:35.059> firstly<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.510> main<00:00:36.690> point<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
things firstly the main point this is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.619 
things firstly the main point this is
the<00:00:37.950> writer's<00:00:38.399> point<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> view<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> topic

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the writer's point of view on the topic

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
the writer's point of view on the topic
or<00:00:39.840> issue<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> reason<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.520> have

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
or issue it is the reason they have

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.720 
or issue it is the reason they have
written<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.969> paper<00:00:42.649> secondly<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.800> series<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
written the paper secondly a series of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
written the paper secondly a series of
ideas<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.780> support<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.320> main<00:00:46.500> point<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
ideas that support the main point and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.760 
ideas that support the main point and
third<00:00:47.690> evidence<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> support<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.379> ideas

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
third evidence to support those ideas

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.939 
third evidence to support those ideas
for<00:00:50.520> example<00:00:50.610> citing<00:00:51.600> previous<00:00:51.989> research<00:00:52.410> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
for example citing previous research in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.250 
for example citing previous research in
other<00:00:53.399> words<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> reasons<00:00:55.079> why

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
other words these are the reasons why

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.439 
other words these are the reasons why
the<00:00:55.320> writer<00:00:55.800> has<00:00:56.280> taken<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> particular<00:00:57.000> point

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
