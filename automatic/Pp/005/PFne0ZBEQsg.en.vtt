that's<00:04:56.949> what<00:04:57.130> scientists<00:04:57.580> do<00:04:57.909> so<00:04:58.530> if<00:04:59.530> you've

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
that's what scientists do so if you've

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.320 
that's what scientists do so if you've
heard<00:05:00.340> alien<00:05:00.760> abduction<00:05:01.270> stories

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.219 

herpetologist<00:05:04.330> do<00:05:04.479> basically<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.080> same

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
herpetologist do basically the same

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.950 
herpetologist do basically the same
thing<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.949> to<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.880> animals<00:05:07.210> they<00:05:07.360> catch<00:05:07.630> and

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
thing to to the animals they catch and

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.430 
thing to to the animals they catch and
release<00:05:08.800> after<00:05:09.400> study<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.940> that's<00:05:13.840> my<00:05:14.050> alien

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
release after study so that's my alien

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.010 
release after study so that's my alien
abduction<00:05:14.500> story<00:05:15.340> but<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.599> was
