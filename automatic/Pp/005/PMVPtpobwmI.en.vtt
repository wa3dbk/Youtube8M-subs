00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.010
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:41.320
 first tuning review on the trucks evo 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.320
 10 16h xl so in the industry us version 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.790
 We'll catch it soon 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.489
 to the electronics then I have 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.460
 not big enough because that's fast 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:57.379
 enough is in there once the bandages 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:01.030
 lines vxl engine in the 380 size 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.699
 and just the right controller as 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.310
 longest where i once had high tech 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.490
 it's a bit hard to put in that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.070
 but it worked 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.840
 but you can also find it in 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.380
 a left of the description one 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.210
 detailed explanation like the part 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.270
 can be installed and what is there 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.659
 to pay attention 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.180
 as receiver and last electronic 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.890
 component a bit hidden in car 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.149
 this box is a loose mistakes so mr 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:44.840
 x3 thousand ddr is identical to the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:47.329
 spectrum sr 3300 next I show 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.399
 the tuned plastic parts are you 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.329
 not many, but very much 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.799
 effectively 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.829
 all the way up and down the rpm are 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.030
 Cleric from the special plastic 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.159
 this material may be 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.990
 should be unbreakable 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.190
 that says at least the manufacturer and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.990
 gives a lifetime warranty 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.120
 Let's see, you really need that 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.880
 endure or at some point 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.980
 actually break that we will 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.209
 then over time 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 still have other theories parts 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.549
 plastic not installed 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.060
 the spoiler there is system, and so 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.720
 necessary that the exchange because 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.230
 through the aggressive engine and one 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.829
 a little restless gashand that's it 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.650
 times that the player breaks down and 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.750
 rips and that naturally displaces the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.250
 Idea driving dynamics and that's why you can 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.739
 easy with my broken player 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.920
 not going ahead is not possible 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.319
 Last but not least seek nor tuning 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.660
 keep parts out 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.579
 So mainly of aluminum, the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.640
 at some point significantly more than the tuning 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.709
 Part of plastic you can see that too 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.340
 Immediately these are the once here 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.260
 the thighs are gpm 's allowed 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.530
 you do not confuse any case with 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.629
 erp mrp must have american 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.930
 Company and the processes 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:28.079
 mainly in plastic that seemingly 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.280
 should be unbreakable and GM is a 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:34.810
 Chinese supplier of 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:40.109
 mainly metal handles that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:43.109
 probably all aluminum yes 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:48.489
 We still have it here too 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:52.630
 came and only stood again 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.329
 you can see that pretty well 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.770
 your service pretty good 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.360
 the informel me though 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.800
 that's behind you then it works 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.140
 actually then they are now in 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.610
 stable and directed so fast and me 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.490
 think that's the main thing 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.170
 to share this 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:18.290
 then I have this back 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.410
 drive shafts made of metal on steel 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.680
 they are from railroads but i can 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.470
 Do not recommend why I explain that in 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.810
 another video 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.440
 everything else is I'll show you the other 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.740
 do not share that work 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.660
 or something else but like him 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.840
 mainly for the ornament or ours 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:46.130
 protection is there is once the rigi 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.330
 train trusts washers one 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:54.200
 screw and a mother who are in 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.310
 the spoiler years drilled and next to it 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.640
 screwed 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:04.880
 and then here in the bracket is still 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.050
 normally used for motors 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.159
 So it will attach to the then 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.020
 world for example is installed there, 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.310
 then you have one more here 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.310
 Threaded rods stuck through with the one 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.770
 Secured few meters 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.319
 on both sides roll on it 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.599
 backed up with a motor 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:34.979
 and with that you actually have 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:34.979
 already a wheelie bar to the bottom 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:43.750
 down here this is a commercial 2 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.440
 mm aluminum plate and have been there 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.270
 I picked out the measures for you 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.560
 partly measured even from and 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.979
 then I just cut it 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:03.370
 bent and mounted that was no 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:06.759
 witchcraft back also that the same 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:10.750
 play here and there then I have that here 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:14.580
 mounted with two screws and that was 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:18.210
 it then from the front still the 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:24.009
 aluminum or name day 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.330
 the steel bumper that got me 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.389
 friend milled 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.909
 I can not say much about that 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.830
 Anyway nikolaus and that's enough 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:34.449
 actually already 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.060
 yes that 's it so far from my side 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.259
 I hope you have my little tuning 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.860
 review 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.139
 If so then let me just 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.750
 by clicking on the like button 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:50.219
 or commented on an abo I would 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:56.060
 I am also very happy if more 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:58.949
 have questions or tips or have any 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.539
 Video wishes then has the synonymous 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:03.330
 like to communicate 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:06.120
 I'm completely open to take that 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.259
 I also implement it in a timely manner 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.259
 Thank you for watching
