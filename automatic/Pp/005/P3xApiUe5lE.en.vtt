00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 I think the football market of the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.960
 phases the first phase to arrive 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.760
 to the primary goals that each club 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040
 target surface was a target 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.410
 primary rossettini was a goal 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.080
 primary is 16 and a primary goal 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 his was a primary goal of the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.460
 alternatives that we have always taken 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 they could be alternatives too 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.830
 the primary but then in the first phase not 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 all primary goals come 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.720
 reached and therefore there is another phase that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.270
 the football market must arrive that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.610
 arrives where it must reach the goals 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.940
 you have to go to achieve the goals 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.480
 those side secondary targets them 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.350
 you can reach and then there is the last one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.020
 third phase where then go to aa 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 learn if the market has left you 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 those primary goals you are 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.110
 escaped that not for many reasons in 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 virtue of an economic situation or that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 is a player thought to go to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 great club and instead did not go e 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.010
 therefore also together with the objectives 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.140
 secondary than even if we call them 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.270
 secondary in a manner of speaking but I also have 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.369
 asked with dario in a context of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.340
 team is important when how much 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.320
 the first one that balotelli has a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.380
 net salary of 5 6 million euros 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 so we say that we are far from 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.210
 profiles and economic situations of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.820
 this bologna today can do knowing that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.360
 must do so much and can not do just for 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.850
 1 2 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.520
 and I think some players have 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.770
 referred to balotelli and not only 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 exploiting their motivations from a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 hard time they passed 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.070
 relying on their faults could 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.899
 have the reasons to prove to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.790
 who can afford it certain 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.079
 soccer players that would not be one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.189
 wrong choice 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.950
 I'm not one I like to do 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.409
 little program I try to work for 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.049
 achieve goals to stay 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.300
 our fan 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.330
 our fan when 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.690
 the market will know to finish football 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 that we have worked so hard we are 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 strive to do so and we have striven for 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.110
 try to do it our way 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.850
 in my own way I emphasize those things 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.160
 in the interest of the bologna to give to the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.180
 bologna to put for bologna the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.840
 foundations of the strong bases why 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.650
 this phase is a very phase 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.560
 important 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:44.250
 I'm trying to do it my way 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.520
 he has a way of joey known on behalf of the way 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.950
 of society and to do it with ours 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.770
 culture with the way we do 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.770
 knowing that this will bring benefits 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.120
 to the building we are building 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.640
 we are the bologna and who comes to 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.940
 bologna must be motivated to come 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.400
 to come to bologna us 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.190
 we are trying to leave 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.620
 meanwhile from those that are 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.750
 important potential we have are 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.720
 but always as potential from those 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.480
 that we have not seen at home or with 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.920
 homo you see masina you see ferrari not 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.310
 have ever made the series a but we are 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.950
 we thought we focus 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.770
 on our potential can be 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.770
 tomorrow a fruit of our work
