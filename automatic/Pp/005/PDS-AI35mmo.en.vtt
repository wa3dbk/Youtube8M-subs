of the league and the blades

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.110 
of the league and the blades
organization<00:00:59.110> so<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.790> thought<00:01:00.790> that's

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
organization so I thought that's

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.340 
organization so I thought that's
probably<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.540> biggest<00:01:01.750> thing<00:01:01.930> that<00:01:02.080> it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
probably the biggest thing that it's

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.940 
probably the biggest thing that it's
helpful<00:01:02.589> for<00:01:02.739> I'd<00:01:03.370> say<00:01:03.699> tell<00:01:04.269> me<00:01:04.390> about<00:01:04.479> the

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
helpful for I'd say tell me about the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.500 
helpful for I'd say tell me about the
experience<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.010> you<00:01:06.130> had<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.909> past<00:01:07.210> year

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
experience that you had this past year

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.149 
experience that you had this past year
being<00:01:07.990> around<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.500> hockey<00:01:08.650> club<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.010> little

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
being around the hockey club a little

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.950 
being around the hockey club a little
bit<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.299> make<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.659> little<00:01:10.810> easier

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
bit is it make it a little easier

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.539 
bit is it make it a little easier
getting<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.590> transition<00:01:12.159> in<00:01:12.280> for<00:01:12.430> your

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
getting the transition in for your

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.969 
getting the transition in for your
rookie<00:01:12.880> season<00:01:13.180> coming<00:01:13.360> up<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.530> makes<00:01:14.770> the

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
rookie season coming up so it makes the

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.520 
rookie season coming up so it makes the
biggest<00:01:15.880> difference<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.659> know<00:01:16.690> they<00:01:16.960> they

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
biggest difference you know they they

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.230 
biggest difference you know they they

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
said earlier it's just a great

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.520 
said earlier it's just a great
organization<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:25.600> far<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.080> best<00:01:26.290> I've<00:01:26.500> ever

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
organization by far the best I've ever

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.210 
organization by far the best I've ever
heard<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.750> just<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.470> be<00:01:29.590> accepted<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.730 
heard of and it just to be accepted the
way<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.370> was<00:01:30.700> made<00:01:31.090> all<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.600> more<00:01:32.170> difference

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
and it makes it a lot easier coming here

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.860 
and it makes it a lot easier coming here
as<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.570> rookie<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:36.430> just<00:01:36.870> undescribable

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
as a rookie so it's just undescribable

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.430 
as a rookie so it's just undescribable

you know just doing things faster than
they<00:02:03.939> had<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.270> be<00:02:04.390> done<00:02:04.569> even<00:02:04.810> though<00:02:04.990> maybe

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
they had to be done even though maybe

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.139 
they had to be done even though maybe
you're<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.009> step<00:02:06.219> ahead<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.670> lot<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.880> guys

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
you're a step ahead of a lot of guys

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.969 
you're a step ahead of a lot of guys
it's<00:02:07.810> better<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.259> step<00:02:08.530> ahead<00:02:08.560> than

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
it's better to be a step ahead than

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.789 
it's better to be a step ahead than
behind<00:02:09.009> right<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.239> just<00:02:10.899> tried<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.650> apply

that<00:02:12.069> as<00:02:12.250> much<00:02:12.430> as<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.700> could<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:14.170> physical

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that as much as I could and the physical

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.500 
that as much as I could and the physical
part<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.549> bigger<00:02:15.760> bodies<00:02:16.269> more

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
part of it is just bigger bodies more

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.970 
part of it is just bigger bodies more
mature<00:02:16.810> all<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.170> kind<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.440> stuff<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.830> that's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
mature all that kind of stuff and that's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.320 
mature all that kind of stuff and that's
just<00:02:18.069> going<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.310> come<00:02:18.459> with<00:02:18.610> experience<00:02:18.849> and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
just going to come with experience and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.770 
just going to come with experience and
me<00:02:20.110> maturing<00:02:20.620> as<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.799> as<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.370> player<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
me maturing as a as a player and as a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.839 
me maturing as a as a player and as a
person<00:02:23.049> just<00:02:23.470> getting<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.430> weight<00:02:24.640> behind

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
person just getting that weight behind

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.789 
person just getting that weight behind
me<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.360> that's<00:02:26.079> nothing<00:02:26.530> i<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.769> really

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
me and that's nothing i can really

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.670 
me and that's nothing i can really
control<00:02:27.310> at<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.610> point<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.209> i<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
control at this point but i think the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.039 
control at this point but i think the
biggest<00:02:29.890> thing<00:02:30.069> was<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.430> speed<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.599> what<00:02:31.840> does

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
biggest thing was the speed so what does

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.479 
biggest thing was the speed so what does
the<00:02:32.170> rest<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> summer<00:02:32.680> entail<00:02:33.099> then<00:02:33.340> for
