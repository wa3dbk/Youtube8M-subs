00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
winter any plant is a bulb so they are

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.639 
winter any plant is a bulb so they are
definitely<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.550> bulb<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
definitely a bulb and so you want to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.939 
definitely a bulb and so you want to
plant<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.039> about<00:00:59.160> 3<00:00:59.640> inches<00:01:00.149> above<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.649> bulb

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
plant them about 3 inches above the bulb

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
plant them about 3 inches above the bulb
in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.460> ground<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.690> they've

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in the ground now you can see they've

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800 
in the ground now you can see they've
got<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.470> eyes<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.640> send<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.090> shoots<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
got to have eyes to send up shoots and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.890 
got to have eyes to send up shoots and
so<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.250> parts<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> bottom<00:01:09.540> don't

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so the little parts on the bottom don't

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
so the little parts on the bottom don't
seem<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> matter<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.740> much<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.369> about

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
seem to matter as much it's all about

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
seem to matter as much it's all about
the<00:01:11.880> eyes<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.110> one's<00:01:13.409> got<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> couple

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the eyes now this one's got a couple

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.580 
the eyes now this one's got a couple
eyes<00:01:14.280> coming<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.970> too<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.470> you're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
eyes coming up too and so when you're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
eyes coming up too and so when you're
trying<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> figure<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.189> which<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.970> let

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
trying to figure out which way is up let

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.690 
trying to figure out which way is up let
the<00:01:18.750> eyes<00:01:18.900> tell<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.130> whatever<00:01:20.460> direction

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the eyes tell you so whatever direction

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
the eyes tell you so whatever direction
they're<00:01:21.299> pointing<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.590> plan<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
they're pointing then you plan them that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
they're pointing then you plan them that
direction<00:01:23.430> sometimes<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.689> early<00:01:24.960> spring

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
direction sometimes if it's early spring

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
direction sometimes if it's early spring
you<00:01:25.290> cannot<00:01:25.590> even<00:01:25.799> see<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> eyes<00:01:26.369> yet<00:01:26.759> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you cannot even see the eyes yet so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810 
you cannot even see the eyes yet so
wherever<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.960> meet<00:01:28.229> together<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:29.009> where<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
wherever they meet together is where the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.179 
wherever they meet together is where the
stalk<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.270> from<00:01:30.509> last<00:01:30.750> year<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.680> usually

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
stalk was from last year that's usually

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
stalk was from last year that's usually
a<00:01:32.220> good<00:01:32.280> indication<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.509> way<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.840> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a good indication on which way is that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
a good indication on which way is that
but<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.040> eyes<00:01:35.250> were<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
but because these eyes were kind of to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
but because these eyes were kind of to
this<00:01:35.939> direction<00:01:36.450> I'll<00:01:36.689> plant<00:01:36.990> them<00:01:37.079> right

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
this direction I'll plant them right

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.190 
this direction I'll plant them right
this<00:01:38.040> direction<00:01:38.700> now<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.299> key<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.630> three

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this direction now the key is three

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
this direction now the key is three
inches<00:01:40.530> deep<00:01:40.710> even<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> eye<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.520> coming<00:01:42.030> up

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
inches deep even if the eye is coming up

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.609 
inches deep even if the eye is coming up
you<00:01:42.360> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> plant<00:01:42.840> them<00:01:42.930> deep<00:01:42.960> enough<00:01:43.409> so

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
you want to plant them deep enough so

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
you want to plant them deep enough so
that<00:01:44.220> they're<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.790> fall<00:01:44.970> over<00:01:45.390> for

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that they're not going to fall over for

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.630 
that they're not going to fall over for
one<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.770> stay<00:01:46.950> moist<00:01:47.250> enough

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
one and that they can stay moist enough

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
one and that they can stay moist enough
when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.509> water<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.470> they'll

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
when you do water them and then they'll

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.719 
when you do water them and then they'll
have<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> extra<00:01:50.579> protection

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
have a little bit of extra protection

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
have a little bit of extra protection
for<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.360> winter<00:01:51.600> time<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
for the winter time so you just want to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.620 
for the winter time so you just want to
fill<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> pot<00:01:54.149> maybe<00:01:54.509> halfway<00:01:54.810> full<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
fill the pot maybe halfway full and a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
fill the pot maybe halfway full and a
lot<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> times<00:01:57.869> I'll<00:01:58.020> mix<00:01:58.170> gravel<00:01:58.740> even<00:01:59.100> in

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
lot of times I'll mix gravel even in

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.039 
lot of times I'll mix gravel even in
with<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.700> soil<00:02:00.030> because<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.570> gives<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
with my soil because it gives it a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.620 
with my soil because it gives it a
little<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.290> drainage<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:02.130> sand<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.420> like

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
little more drainage or sand and I like

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.090 
little more drainage or sand and I like
gravel<00:02:04.020> too<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.799> gives<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.070> lot

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
gravel too because it really gives a lot

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
gravel too because it really gives a lot
of<00:02:05.250> drainage<00:02:05.729> especially<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.450> warm<00:02:07.020> or

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
of drainage especially to warm or

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
of drainage especially to warm or
climate<00:02:07.710> or<00:02:07.860> plants<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.849> don't<00:02:09.090> want

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
climate or plants that really don't want

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.410 
climate or plants that really don't want
to<00:02:09.509> sit<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.750> muck<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.209> kind<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
to sit in muck so then I just kind of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.520 
to sit in muck so then I just kind of
set<00:02:12.660> them<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> pot

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
set them in the pot

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
set them in the pot
and<00:02:13.740> dahlias<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:14.820> very<00:02:15.030> social<00:02:15.570> they<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:15.960> to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and dahlias are very social they like to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.480 
and dahlias are very social they like to
be<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.320> grooves<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:16.980> don't<00:02:17.130> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.370> put

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
be in grooves so you don't want to put

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.860 
be in grooves so you don't want to put
them<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.640> timeout<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.240> don't<00:02:18.360> put<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.660> one

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
them in timeout you don't put just one

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.330 
them in timeout you don't put just one
in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.110> corner<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.440> want<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:19.800> groups<00:02:20.130> of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
in the corner you want to put groups of

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.070 
in the corner you want to put groups of
dahlias<00:02:21.090> together<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.600> they'll<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.870> much

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
dahlias together and they'll do much

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.750 
dahlias together and they'll do much
better<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.650> be<00:02:22.860> different<00:02:23.160> varieties

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
better they can be different varieties

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580 
better they can be different varieties
together<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.330> long<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:24.540> they're<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.410> same

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
together as long as they're the same

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.980 
together as long as they're the same
plant<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:27.000> I'm<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.750> cover

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
plant and then I'm just going to cover

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.020 
plant and then I'm just going to cover
all<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.370> kind<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> mix

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
all of that up and I kind of have a mix

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.620 
all of that up and I kind of have a mix
of<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.570> lot<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.080> gravel<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.980> soil<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
of a lot of gravel in here in soil and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.820 
of a lot of gravel in here in soil and
I've<00:02:36.630> got<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.050> chute<00:02:37.350> that's<00:02:37.620> already

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
I've got the chute that's already

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.330 
I've got the chute that's already
growing<00:02:38.220> coming<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.690> soil<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:41.310> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
growing coming out of the soil now I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.670 
growing coming out of the soil now I
want<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> water<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.120> well<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.500> don't

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
want to water that well but you don't

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680 
want to water that well but you don't
want<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.100> sit<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.640> water<00:02:44.850> too<00:02:45.209> much<00:02:45.390> either

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
want it to sit in water too much either

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.180 
want it to sit in water too much either
because<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.080> going<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> start<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.680> rot<00:02:46.890> so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
because it's going to start to rot so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.070 
because it's going to start to rot so
you<00:02:47.640> want<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.940> kind<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.150> check<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.570> if<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.930> in

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
you want to kind of check it if it is in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.380 
you want to kind of check it if it is in
a<00:02:49.140> pot<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.950> want<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.190> saucer<00:02:50.580> underneath<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.330> it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
a pot you want a saucer underneath so it

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.729 
a pot you want a saucer underneath so it
at<00:02:51.570> least<00:02:51.720> holds<00:02:52.110> some<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.410> water<00:02:52.650> and

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
at least holds some of the water and

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.770 
at least holds some of the water and
soaks<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.220> back<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.640> at<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> same<00:02:54.420> time<00:02:54.480> you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
soaks it back in at the same time you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.690 
soaks it back in at the same time you
don't<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.260> sit<00:02:55.560> sitting<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.370> water

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
don't want to just sit sitting in water

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.190 
don't want to just sit sitting in water
all<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> time<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.870> lose<00:02:58.050> them

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
all the time because you can lose them

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.440 
all the time because you can lose them
that<00:02:58.380> way<00:02:58.590> dahlias<00:02:59.550> can<00:02:59.700> handle<00:03:00.000> warm<00:03:00.209> shade

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that way dahlias can handle warm shade
