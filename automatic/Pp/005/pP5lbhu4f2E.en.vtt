00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that at all the steering on this is

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
power systems given the choice I think I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.750 
power systems given the choice I think I
go<00:03:51.210> about<00:03:51.510> power<00:03:51.780> assistance<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.460> doesn't

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
go about power assistance but it doesn't

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.200 
go about power assistance but it doesn't
really<00:03:53.910> intrude<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.510> driving<00:03:54.780> experience

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
really intrude on the driving experience

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.550 
really intrude on the driving experience
later<00:03:57.210> the<00:03:57.450> engine<00:03:57.720> at<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.840> back<00:03:57.960> really

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
later the engine at the back really

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.750 
later the engine at the back really
isn't<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:58.980> problem<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.430> think<00:03:59.640> you'd<00:03:59.730> have

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
isn't the problem I think you'd have

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.280 
isn't the problem I think you'd have
been<00:04:00.030> pushing<00:04:00.330> quite<00:04:00.540> hard<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.080> all<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
been pushing quite hard and all the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.390 
been pushing quite hard and all the
conditions<00:04:01.710> would<00:04:01.830> have<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.100> be<00:04:02.190> quite

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
conditions would have to be quite

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.690 
conditions would have to be quite
slippery<00:04:02.700> before<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.330> took<00:04:03.510> effect<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.430> I

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
slippery before that took effect so I

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.160 
slippery before that took effect so I
wouldn't<00:04:06.060> be<00:04:06.150> too<00:04:06.300> concerned<00:04:06.450> about<00:04:06.750> doing

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
wouldn't be too concerned about doing

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.810 
wouldn't be too concerned about doing
that<00:04:07.320> if<00:04:07.440> you're<00:04:07.530> in<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.680> market<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.190> buy<00:04:08.370> or

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
the nice thing about this car is the way
