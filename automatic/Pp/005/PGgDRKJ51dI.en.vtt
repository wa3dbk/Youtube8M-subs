00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello to all and sky pink here is a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.300
 little part in general scrum so on 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.330
 mission on mw3 of course it will be at 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.820
 sniper with the bar is and the bar is in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 and yes it's nice I had the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.090
 parent is an honor I managed well 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 I struggled a little bit because it's 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.810
 it's not that easy to see it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 play a little with the bar is and for 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.529
 develop the experience by 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.640
 report to senators but that's 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.590
 precisely an innovation that is 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.590
 really great ie 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 develops tears because we play with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.640
 is not because we have to develop the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.620
 others and so that's where we got the sniper 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.450
 in gold because we use this sniper there 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.040
 and that's a big innovation by 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.800
 compared to other games whatsoever 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.570
 it is t4 or blackops cod4 it was necessary 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 do all the snipers to have 1 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.980
 only gold and black ops needed 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.180
 reach the prestige 14 I believe I 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090
 I'm not sure I did not go that far 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.880
 I do not know you but forget 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.540
 so there we really aim where plays 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.970
 with a weapon 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 the more you developed it and found that 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.860
 it's really the best formula 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.300
 because ben we are we like a 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.770
 weapon so we like well developed this 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.060
 weapon there and we clean obliged to play 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.560
 with two frames to be able to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.750
 develop 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.700
 so it's very very good formula so 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.560
 here I am in general scrum on 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.760
 mission is the first time I 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.240
 am on this map there because I have 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.920
 played in cup and at war at war and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.700
 so we can not play on this map the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 in war apparently 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.910
 finally I never fall on it so good 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.140
 I played a day you will tell me 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.060
 it's not huge 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.570
 I would see well for the rest so I have 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 taken for killstreaks of plants 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.220
 support so I have the parcels trapped very 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.020
 practice frankly that makes it 1 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.000
 who insured him every time or two 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.630
 plus the parcel bomb and that's it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.570
 really great 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.430
 after I have the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.460
 what is the name of the bomber 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.910
 Stealth French in French and ump 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.160
 so that's so I played scop hockey 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.410
 so the clubs are really good 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.810
 danger here and there I believe they have a 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.700
 can ease the anger of people who do not 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.530
 you under the toque and who street struggles to 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.060
 shopping tape there this time 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.360
 i mean if you love the king's 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.610
 cup 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.720
 you are royally served because the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.280
 balls this awesome top 100 but even some 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 times a little too easy what makes 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.300
 disturbing the thing because we have 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.310
 so much there when you play you say ah that's it 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.270
 get home well it fits well you have 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.580
 so much the impression that it fits 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.480
 easily who ultimately will you like it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.250
 not with a little bit of a treatment a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.270
 little usual it makes cnikel so that's it 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.190
 really there I played on a 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.080
 day I did mainly the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.980
 virgin and evolution not yet of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.220
 search and destroy 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.900
 this is my second part 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.000
 the general I think the first one was 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.540
 a part in progress so for me it's 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.019
 no 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.909
 super good a first part I can 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.040
 I already win and I'm sniper 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.040
 good I think the others set up 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.690
 although this double-edged because 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.710
 that there are people who is a little bit 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.170
 relook but hey I mean that's a 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.370
 game people play in the middle 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.290
 the advantage is that tickle 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.560
 more is that hellip are 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.080
 still pretty much reduced 1 compared 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 compared to previous episodes for 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.600
 the still exists that I mean you 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 can not prevent on the building sites 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.870
 news 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.950
 my guys there again a little bit it's 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.140
 before the game still a lot 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.940
 much more comfortable compared to 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.310
 before playing at war I have the example 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.820
 of mw2 always say well no it's 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.700
 the horror the potato hunters danger 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.220
 bring closer or war machine and that's 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.880
 there all that has disappeared finally except that 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.890
 launches potatoes 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.620
 he had said robert bowling like 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.390
 it's really part of the war there 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.070
 do not remove them but still 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.570
 they were pretty much reduced we send 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.750
 some or launches potatoes and 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.310
 really it's not embarrassing in the game 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.530
 so that's it so I think this game there 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.590
 is really a very very good game to by 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.000
 compared to the episodes of call of duty which 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.410
 looks like it's true it's a good 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.780
 combination has yielded 4 mw 2 blow 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.470
 it really works great so having to 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.500
 the long 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.090
 what happens if the game at the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.470
 the other call of duty good for 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.500
 the moment I see nothing opposing it 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.260
 but we never know huh 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.120
 and then two months after the people especially 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.920
 to turn on others except the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.030
 brave people who have remained or 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.100
 people who fell in love with this game 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.340
 that's also for me it's not the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.580
 case 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.400
 So that's good but so good bah 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.500
 first part 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.060
 in general melee sniper I hope that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 you like it touched at the end 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.969
 soon 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.929
 but 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.759
 so I will try to do more 

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:43.649
 parties tell me if there are modes that 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.709
 you would like to see weapons that you 

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:49.349
 have to see what gameplay all in fact 

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:51.149
 the duty and I'll do that that's good ben 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.990
 I give you a big thank you to all of you 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:52.790
 know that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.400
 between you 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.250
 so enjoy well have fun and 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.820
 I tell you next time for for a 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.860
 new video 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.240
 so here's a little I like about the video 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.849
 it's really fun 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 a lot of work behind that thank you 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.240
 to you
