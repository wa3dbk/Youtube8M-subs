fight<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.210> thought<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.289> both<00:00:26.130> men<00:00:26.369> came<00:00:26.730> out

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
fight I thought that both men came out

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
fight I thought that both men came out
hard<00:00:27.269> both<00:00:27.539> men<00:00:27.840> came<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:29.010> something<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
hard both men came out with something to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.200 
hard both men came out with something to
prove<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.660> more<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.669> Danny<00:00:32.669> Garcia

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
prove I think more so Danny Garcia

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
prove I think more so Danny Garcia
because<00:00:33.660> fight<00:00:33.960> after<00:00:34.320> fight<00:00:34.350> he's<00:00:34.920> been

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
because fight after fight he's been

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
because fight after fight he's been
overlooked<00:00:35.640> fight<00:00:35.969> after<00:00:36.329> fight<00:00:36.360> he's<00:00:36.750> been

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
overlooked fight after fight he's been

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
overlooked fight after fight he's been
disrespected<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.210> giving<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.600> chance

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.979

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that you know danny swift Garcia did

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020 
that you know danny swift Garcia did
what<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> said<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> he<00:01:10.020> needed<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
what I said that he needed to do in that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
what I said that he needed to do in that
fight<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.900> was<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.260> had<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.130> ring

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
fight which was he had to use the ring

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340 
fight which was he had to use the ring
which<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:14.880> something<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.600> haven't<00:01:16.080> seen

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
which was something that we haven't seen

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740 
which was something that we haven't seen
from<00:01:16.710> him<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.130> his<00:01:17.490> fights<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:17.909> he<00:01:18.240> he's

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
from him in his fights because he he's

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510 
from him in his fights because he he's
uh<00:01:18.780> he's<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.619> used<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.009> standing<00:01:20.400> his

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
uh he's so used to just standing his

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.580 
uh he's so used to just standing his
ground<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.200> implanting<00:01:22.200> his<00:01:22.290> feet<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
ground and implanting his feet and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.950 
ground and implanting his feet and
landing<00:01:22.920> big<00:01:23.340> left<00:01:23.640> hooks<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.630> fight

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
landing big left hooks but in this fight

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.710 
landing big left hooks but in this fight
I'm<00:01:25.290> he<00:01:25.530> moved<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.460> mobile<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> he<00:01:27.180> boxed

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
I'm he moved he was mobile and he boxed

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
I'm he moved he was mobile and he boxed
and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.650> he<00:01:28.799> showed<00:01:29.299> not<00:01:30.299> only

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and I think he showed not only

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
and I think he showed not only
tremendous<00:01:31.079> heart<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.530> he<00:01:31.619> showed<00:01:31.829> talent

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
tremendous heart but he showed talent

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.330 
tremendous heart but he showed talent
and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.110> when<00:01:34.530> you're<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and I think that you know when you're to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.710 
and I think that you know when you're to
be<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> great<00:01:35.729> boxer<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> show

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
be a great boxer you have to show

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
be a great boxer you have to show
versatility<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.430> Matisse<00:01:39.329> say<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
versatility I think that Matisse say I

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749 
versatility I think that Matisse say I
won't<00:01:39.780> say<00:01:39.900> he<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.140> exposed<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.189> think

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
won't say he was exposed but I think

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389 
won't say he was exposed but I think
that<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.090> his<00:01:42.240> fight<00:01:42.649> he<00:01:43.649> didn't<00:01:43.950> show<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> he

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that in his fight he didn't show that he

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
that in his fight he didn't show that he
was<00:01:44.520> able<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.909> adapt<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> change<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
was able to adapt to a change in the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.460 
was able to adapt to a change in the
situation<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.299> his<00:01:48.509> eye<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
situation and I know his eye was was

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
situation and I know his eye was was
closed<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.250> thought<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.759> corner<00:01:51.119> did<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
than that I thought that he did show

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.590 
than that I thought that he did show
poise<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.920> thought<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:26.790> having<00:02:27.210> his<00:02:27.330> dad

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.030 
poise I thought you know having his dad
in<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.870> corner<00:02:28.200> makes<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.500> huge<00:02:28.710> difference

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
in this corner makes a huge difference

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040 
in this corner makes a huge difference
because<00:02:29.280> his<00:02:30.090> dad<00:02:30.360> gives<00:02:30.660> him<00:02:30.780> his<00:02:30.840> confidence

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
because his dad gives him his confidence

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.810 
because his dad gives him his confidence
even<00:02:31.500> stopping<00:02:31.860> them<00:02:32.040> around<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.490> corner

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
even stopping them around in the corner

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.670 
even stopping them around in the corner
telling<00:02:33.060> him<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.270> wake<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.380> think

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
telling him to wake up and I think

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.000 
telling him to wake up and I think
that's<00:02:34.920> what<00:02:35.160> makes<00:02:35.430> danny<00:02:36.210> swift<00:02:36.480> garcia<00:02:37.080> a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that's what makes danny swift garcia a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.400 
that's what makes danny swift garcia a
fun<00:02:38.910> boxer<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.360> watch<00:02:39.510> because<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.260> never

fun boxer to watch because you never

other than you know as far as maybe Tim
Bradley<00:02:55.410> who's<00:02:55.890> undefeated<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.180> fights

not going to happen cuz he's with
top-ranked<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.130> think<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.880> he's<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.270> only

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420

sort of challenge to Mayweather as far

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.980 
sort of challenge to Mayweather as far
as<00:03:04.980> boxing<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.550> forcing<00:03:05.940> Mayweather<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> have

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
to change things up and of course his

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.740 
to change things up and of course his
dad<00:03:09.470> would<00:03:10.470> definitely<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:11.660> probably<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
dad would definitely have probably a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.290 
dad would definitely have probably a
pretty<00:03:12.900> good<00:03:13.140> game<00:03:13.320> plan<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.950> I'm<00:03:14.160> sure<00:03:14.400> that

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
pretty good game plan and I'm sure that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.740 
pretty good game plan and I'm sure that
you<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.930> he<00:03:16.320> would<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.860> able<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.750> force

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you know he would be able to force

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.300 
you know he would be able to force
Mayweather<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.230> have<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.620> change<00:03:19.890> his<00:03:20.070> looks

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
Mayweather to have to change his looks

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.530 
Mayweather to have to change his looks
and<00:03:20.430> adjust<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> different<00:03:20.970> things<00:03:21.360> because

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and adjust to different things because

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.500 
and adjust to different things because
you<00:03:22.500> know<00:03:22.880> Mayweather<00:03:23.880> wouldn't<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.210> able<00:03:24.270> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
you know Mayweather wouldn't be able to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.200 
you know Mayweather wouldn't be able to
sit<00:03:24.720> there<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.110> pot<00:03:25.530> shot<00:03:25.860> Danny<00:03:26.760> Garcia<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
sit there and pot shot Danny Garcia the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.490 
sit there and pot shot Danny Garcia the
same<00:03:27.510> way<00:03:27.660> he's<00:03:27.870> done<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> other

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
same way he's done with the other

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.440 
same way he's done with the other
fighters<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.400> would<00:03:29.940> definitely<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.390> a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
fighters so it would definitely be a

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.100 
fighters so it would definitely be a
good<00:03:30.510> fight<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.930> thought<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.940> knowing<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
good fight I thought I knowing of in the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.800 
good fight I thought I knowing of in the
original<00:03:34.580> analysis<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.790> predicted<00:03:36.360> this

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
original analysis that I predicted this

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.500 
original analysis that I predicted this
fight<00:03:37.050> wouldn't<00:03:37.320> go<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.440> distance<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.510> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
fight wouldn't go to distance so you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.300 
fight wouldn't go to distance so you
know<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.530> everybody<00:03:40.950> was<00:03:41.100> wrong

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
know I think I think everybody was wrong

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.880 
know I think I think everybody was wrong
on<00:03:41.460> that<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.670> think<00:03:42.000> too<00:03:42.120> many<00:03:42.210> people

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
on that I think too many people

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.260 
on that I think too many people
predicted<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.190> fight<00:03:44.430> would<00:03:45.030> go<00:03:45.210> to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
predicted that the fight would go to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.260 
predicted that the fight would go to
distance<00:03:45.780> but<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.790> truth<00:03:48.090> be<00:03:48.120> known

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
distance but you know truth be known

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.060 
distance but you know truth be known
because<00:03:48.810> ever<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.410> did<00:03:49.650> say<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:49.860> I

Garcia<00:03:58.680> winning<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.070> fight<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.550> didn't<00:04:00.330> you

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
Garcia winning the fight I didn't you

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.230 
Garcia winning the fight I didn't you
know<00:04:01.290> say<00:04:01.590> whether<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.950> be<00:04:02.100> a<00:04:02.130> by<00:04:02.760> knockout<00:04:03.210> or

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
know say whether it be a by knockout or

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.400 
know say whether it be a by knockout or
decision<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.990> he<00:04:04.080> would<00:04:04.200> win<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
decision just that he would win the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.500 
decision just that he would win the
fight<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:05.520> was<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.790> based<00:04:06.030> off<00:04:06.210> of<00:04:06.270> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
fight and I was just based off of the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.860 
fight and I was just based off of the
fact<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:07.290> think<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:07.950> if<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:09.360> fight<00:04:09.570> came

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
fact that I think that if the fight came

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.810 
fact that I think that if the fight came
down<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.260> having<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.680> adjust<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.520> things

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
down to having to adjust and do things

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.150 
down to having to adjust and do things
to<00:04:12.000> survive<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:13.140> Garcia<00:04:13.620> could<00:04:13.830> do<00:04:14.010> it

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
to survive that Garcia could do it

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.270 
to survive that Garcia could do it
better<00:04:14.400> than<00:04:14.520> Matisse

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
better than Matisse

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.490 
better than Matisse
they<00:04:15.370> could<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:15.850> that's<00:04:16.389> because<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.350> know

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
they could and that's because I you know

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.229 
they could and that's because I you know
just<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:17.829> people<00:04:18.160> say<00:04:18.340> Garcia<00:04:18.880> hasn't<00:04:19.060> been

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
just like people say Garcia hasn't been

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.840 
just like people say Garcia hasn't been
in<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.450> with<00:04:19.690> anyone<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:21.340> know<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.639> same

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
in it with anyone you know the same

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.150 
in it with anyone you know the same
could<00:04:22.060> be<00:04:22.090> said<00:04:22.210> with<00:04:22.660> Matisse<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
could be said with Matisse a and the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.190 
could be said with Matisse a and the
times<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.490> he<00:04:24.700> did<00:04:24.880> have<00:04:24.910> problems<00:04:25.270> with<00:04:25.630> was

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
times that he did have problems with was

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.820 
times that he did have problems with was
with<00:04:26.410> boxers<00:04:26.889> who<00:04:27.010> can<00:04:27.190> move<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.639> I<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:28.090> I

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
with boxers who can move and I and I

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.530 
with boxers who can move and I and I
basted<00:04:29.830> my<00:04:30.040> bet<00:04:30.400> based<00:04:30.760> on<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> fact<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:31.450> I

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
basted my bet based on the fact that I

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.200 
basted my bet based on the fact that I
thought<00:04:31.870> that<00:04:32.139> Garcia<00:04:33.130> would<00:04:33.400> be<00:04:33.460> able<00:04:33.940> to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
thought that Garcia would be able to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.020 
thought that Garcia would be able to
move<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.780> when<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:35.770> are<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:36.280> there<00:04:36.580> with<00:04:36.910> the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
move and when you are in there with the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.670 
move and when you are in there with the
knockout<00:04:37.419> puncher<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.169> know<00:04:38.350> there's<00:04:38.590> a
