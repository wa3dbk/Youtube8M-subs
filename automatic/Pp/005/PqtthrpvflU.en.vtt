00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
Soviets I should say actually the really

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.100 
Soviets I should say actually the really
interesting<00:00:42.059> thing<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.780> game<00:00:42.930> though

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
interesting thing about this game though

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.450 
interesting thing about this game though
one<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> reasons<00:00:43.710> why<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> probably

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
one of the reasons why I probably

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.560 
one of the reasons why I probably
remember<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.420> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
remember it so well is it's in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.310 
remember it so well is it's in
first-person<00:00:46.230> shooter<00:00:46.739> RTS

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
first-person shooter RTS

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.520 
first-person shooter RTS
yeah<00:00:50.130> so<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.480> surprisingly<00:00:52.290> well

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
yeah so it's actually surprisingly well

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.690 
yeah so it's actually surprisingly well
