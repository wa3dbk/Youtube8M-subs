00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
little like that

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.820 
little like that
/<00:04:35.729> that<00:04:36.300> was<00:04:36.479> probably<00:04:37.080> actually<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.500> fourth

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
/ that was probably actually a fourth

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.030 
/ that was probably actually a fourth
but<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.729> is<00:04:38.970> really<00:04:39.720> really<00:04:39.900> strong<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.740> start

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
but it is really really strong so start

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.800 
but it is really really strong so start
with<00:04:41.160> less<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.699> add<00:04:41.820> more<00:04:42.120> if<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.449> want<00:04:42.660> more
