00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.470
 first half and he really put 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.200
 against the ropes in the article of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.720
 over the goal with that last 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.480
 opportunity concluded the first act and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 radically different was the script of 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.350
 this second part began to arrive 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.170
 the opportunities of the athletic club of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.760
 bilbao and was close to taking the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.540

 with the entrance of muniain and frames 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.680

 andoni iraola in this case the goalkeeper 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.170
 I preferred 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.140
 of clearing the ball over the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.820
 goal and we see there a replica also 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.820
 by the eibar with that shot 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.629
