00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
attack we're not going to be passing

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
attack we're not going to be passing
quite<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.160> uh<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
quite as much as we would with uh say a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.250 
quite as much as we would with uh say a
different<00:00:57.360> team<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> better

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
different team with the better

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
quarterback or something like that so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
quarterback or something like that so
that's<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> adjustment<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.840> made<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.320> are

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that's the adjustment we made now we are

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.470 
that's the adjustment we made now we are
still<00:01:01.859> running<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.609> San<00:01:03.000> Francisco

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
playbook and whatnot but at the same

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
playbook and whatnot but at the same
time<00:01:05.670> we've<00:01:05.909> made<00:01:06.119> adjustments<00:01:06.619> likewise<00:01:07.619> we

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
time we've made adjustments likewise we

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
time we've made adjustments likewise we
have<00:01:07.920> Marcel<00:01:08.280> recent<00:01:08.700> game<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.540> he's<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
have Marcel recent game because he's a

have Marcel recent game because he's a
really<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.170> player<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.650> Raiders

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
really good player for the Raiders

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.310 
really good player for the Raiders
whereas<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.360> most<00:01:12.540> teams<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
whereas you know most teams don't have a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
whereas you know most teams don't have a
fullback<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.430> 90<00:01:14.790> speed<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
fullback that's you know 90 speed can

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690 
fullback that's you know 90 speed can
catch<00:01:15.720> basically<00:01:16.619> play<00:01:16.799> any<00:01:17.040> position<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
catch basically play any position on the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
catch basically play any position on the
field<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> take<00:01:19.409> advantage<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
field so you have to take advantage of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
field so you have to take advantage of
that<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.540> sure<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.020> those<00:01:22.200> good

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that and make sure you get those good

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710 
that and make sure you get those good
players<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.100> teams<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.420> instance

you<00:04:29.520> use<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.640> Raiders<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.300> you're<00:04:30.390> using

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
you use the Raiders and you're using

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.840 
you use the Raiders and you're using
prior<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.500> gotta<00:04:31.740> kind<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.400> get<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.640> guys<00:04:32.820> a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
prior you gotta kind of get the guys a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.880 
prior you gotta kind of get the guys a
little<00:04:33.150> bit<00:04:33.270> more<00:04:33.510> open<00:04:33.930> because<00:04:34.110> he's<00:04:34.560> not

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
little bit more open because he's not

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.110 
little bit more open because he's not
going<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.190> be<00:04:35.280> able<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.490> fit<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.730> into<00:04:35.880> that

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
going to be able to fit it into that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.420 
going to be able to fit it into that
small<00:04:36.390> little<00:04:37.200> area<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.100> ball<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.310> going

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
small little area that the ball is going

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.130 
small little area that the ball is going
to<00:04:38.550> need<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.730> go<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.300> get<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.510> pass<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:39.930> there

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
to need to go to get the pass in there

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.550 
to need to go to get the pass in there
so<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.650> is<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.930> as<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:43.050> can<00:04:43.170> see<00:04:43.290> we<00:04:43.410> got<00:04:43.530> a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
so that is that as you can see we got a

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.370 
so that is that as you can see we got a
nice<00:04:43.770> lead<00:04:44.040> right<00:04:44.280> here<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.790> think<00:04:45.750> prior<00:04:46.050> went

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
nice lead right here I think prior went

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.680 
nice lead right here I think prior went
perfect<00:04:46.890> passing<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.550> game<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.330> again<00:04:48.540> it's

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
perfect passing this game but again it's

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.360 
perfect passing this game but again it's
a<00:04:48.750> lot<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:49.050> check<00:04:49.290> downs<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.800> lot<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:50.100> short

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
a lot of check downs a lot of short

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.100 
a lot of check downs a lot of short
stuff<00:04:50.760> there's<00:04:51.270> nothing<00:04:51.450> wrong<00:04:51.750> with<00:04:51.810> that

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
stuff there's nothing wrong with that

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.440 
stuff there's nothing wrong with that
depending<00:04:53.040> on<00:04:53.040> again<00:04:53.880> what<00:04:54.060> type<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.300> team

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
depending on again what type of team

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.910

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
offensive for this offense I definitely

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.270 
offensive for this offense I definitely
try<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.720> get<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:06.960> lot<00:05:07.200> more<00:05:07.230> shorter<00:05:07.800> yards<00:05:08.190> a

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
try to get a lot more shorter yards a

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.040 
try to get a lot more shorter yards a
lot<00:05:08.490> more<00:05:08.670> check<00:05:08.970> downs<00:05:09.240> because<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> know

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
lot more check downs because I know

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.690 
lot more check downs because I know
prior<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:10.620> make<00:05:10.770> those<00:05:10.950> passes<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:11.610> then

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
prior can make those passes and then

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.670 
prior can make those passes and then
another<00:05:11.970> thing<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.510> once<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.140> get<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.320> QB

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
another thing is once you get a QB

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.050 
another thing is once you get a QB
warmed<00:05:14.040> up<00:05:14.190> he<00:05:14.220> can<00:05:14.430> start<00:05:14.670> making<00:05:14.820> those

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
warmed up he can start making those

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.090 
warmed up he can start making those
passes<00:05:15.510> deeper<00:05:15.840> down<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.110> field<00:05:16.380> which<00:05:16.860> was

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
passes deeper down the field which was

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.800 
passes deeper down the field which was
the<00:05:17.340> case<00:05:17.580> in<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.910> game<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.390> actually

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810
