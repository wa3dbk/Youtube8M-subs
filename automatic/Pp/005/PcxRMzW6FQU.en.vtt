00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
and I just wanted to get a second video

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.690 
and I just wanted to get a second video
with<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:15.750> peppers<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.289> year

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.060 

before<00:00:19.330> they<00:00:19.420> dine<00:00:19.740> everything's<00:00:20.740> about<00:00:21.010> to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
before they dine everything's about to

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.609 
before they dine everything's about to
be<00:00:21.340> dead<00:00:21.580> here<00:00:22.030> as<00:00:22.360> soon<00:00:22.570> as<00:00:22.780> we<00:00:22.930> get<00:00:23.110> a<00:00:23.170> solid

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
be dead here as soon as we get a solid

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.880 
be dead here as soon as we get a solid
freeze<00:00:26.700> so<00:00:27.700> so<00:00:28.420> far<00:00:28.660> we've<00:00:28.960> had<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.619> think<00:00:29.680> three

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
freeze so so far we've had I think three

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.470 
freeze so so far we've had I think three
or<00:00:30.930> more<00:00:31.930> Frost's<00:00:32.650> I<00:00:33.300> haven't<00:00:34.300> covered

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
or more Frost's I haven't covered

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.270 
or more Frost's I haven't covered
anything<00:00:34.809> up<00:00:35.050> because<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.379> hasn't<00:00:35.590> really

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
anything up because it hasn't really

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.450 
anything up because it hasn't really
gotten<00:00:36.610> cold<00:00:36.910> enough<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.180> kill<00:00:37.510> stuff<00:00:38.460> I've

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
gotten cold enough to kill stuff I've

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.020 
gotten cold enough to kill stuff I've
found<00:00:40.270> that<00:00:40.480> happy<00:00:41.400> organic<00:00:42.400> peppers<00:00:42.760> can

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
found that happy organic peppers can

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.410 
found that happy organic peppers can
handle<00:00:43.390> lot<00:00:44.790> probably<00:00:45.790> about<00:00:45.970> thirty<00:00:46.269> degrees

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
handle lot probably about thirty degrees

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.229 
handle lot probably about thirty degrees
or<00:00:46.870> so<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:48.340> being<00:00:48.489> on<00:00:48.519> this<00:00:48.640> patio<00:00:49.059> they

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
or so your being on this patio they

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.759 
or so your being on this patio they
might<00:00:49.420> get<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.629> little<00:00:49.900> bit<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:51.420> warmer

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
might get a little bit little warmer

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.530 
might get a little bit little warmer
microclimate<00:00:53.769> here<00:00:54.010> I've<00:00:54.970> been<00:00:55.089> really<00:00:55.300> lazy

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
microclimate here I've been really lazy

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.410 
microclimate here I've been really lazy
a<00:00:55.750> lot<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:55.960> these<00:00:56.050> peppers<00:00:56.530> are<00:00:57.420> probably

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
a lot of these peppers are probably

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
a lot of these peppers are probably
spoiled<00:00:59.019> yeah<00:00:59.589> on<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.339> plant<00:01:00.989> many<00:01:01.989> more<00:01:02.260> of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
spoiled yeah on the plant many more of

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.730 
spoiled yeah on the plant many more of
them<00:01:02.559> need<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.309> be<00:01:03.460> frozen

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
them need to be frozen

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.980 
them need to be frozen
I've<00:01:05.740> probably<00:01:05.950> frozen<00:01:06.340> 40<00:01:06.850> jalapenos<00:01:07.540> I've

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
I've probably frozen 40 jalapenos I've

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.430 
I've probably frozen 40 jalapenos I've
probably<00:01:08.200> dried<00:01:08.620> 60<00:01:09.250> or<00:01:09.340> 70<00:01:10.000> 60<00:01:10.720> or<00:01:10.810> 70<00:01:11.140> cayenne

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
probably dried 60 or 70 60 or 70 cayenne

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.070 
probably dried 60 or 70 60 or 70 cayenne
so<00:01:11.710> far<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:12.159> got<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.850> lot<00:01:12.970> more<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.180> dry<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.960> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
so far I got a lot more to dry it's the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.100 
so far I got a lot more to dry it's the
topsy-turvy<00:01:17.470> it<00:01:17.920> was<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.040> waste<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.460> time<00:01:19.110> this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
topsy-turvy it was a waste of time this

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.830 
topsy-turvy it was a waste of time this
tomato<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.860> clone<00:01:21.460> off<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.299> topsy<00:01:22.810> turvy

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
tomato is a clone off the topsy turvy

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.279 
tomato is a clone off the topsy turvy
that's<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.530> 15<00:01:23.920> gallon<00:01:24.130> smart<00:01:24.579> plant<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:26.049> did

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
that's a 15 gallon smart plant it did

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.080 
that's a 15 gallon smart plant it did
all<00:01:26.380> right<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:26.740> think<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.130> variety<00:01:27.609> will<00:01:27.700> do<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
all right I think that variety will do a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.770 
all right I think that variety will do a
lot<00:01:28.299> better<00:01:28.509> than<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.659> 30<00:01:28.899> gallon<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:31.420> for<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
lot better than a 30 gallon as for the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.590 
lot better than a 30 gallon as for the
potatoes<00:01:32.170> Oh<00:01:32.590> horn<00:01:33.549> raccoons<00:01:33.969> ate<00:01:34.210> every<00:01:34.450> bit

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
potatoes Oh horn raccoons ate every bit

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.419 
potatoes Oh horn raccoons ate every bit
of<00:01:34.719> corn<00:01:34.899> ahead<00:01:35.200> raccoons<00:01:35.890> got<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.159> all<00:01:36.250> and
