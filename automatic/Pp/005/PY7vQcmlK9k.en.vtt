well<00:00:12.559> of<00:00:12.650> course<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:12.950> office<00:00:13.250> has<00:00:13.400> a<00:00:13.429> lot<00:00:13.670> of

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
well of course this office has a lot of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.249 
well of course this office has a lot of
running<00:00:14.089> players<00:00:14.269> for<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.570> quarterback<00:00:14.990> and

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
running players for the quarterback and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.260 
running players for the quarterback and
that's<00:00:15.740> why<00:00:15.889> we<00:00:15.920> trained<00:00:16.759> so<00:00:16.910> hard<00:00:16.939> in<00:00:17.210> the

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
that's why we trained so hard in the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.179 
that's why we trained so hard in the
offseason<00:00:17.419> conditioning<00:00:17.810> wise<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.680> that's

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
offseason conditioning wise and that's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.519 
offseason conditioning wise and that's
why<00:00:19.279> I<00:00:19.310> often<00:00:19.550> see<00:00:19.820> such<00:00:20.060> a<00:00:20.090> fast<00:00:21.080> pace<00:00:21.199> because

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
why I often see such a fast pace because

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.900 
why I often see such a fast pace because
once<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:21.890> go<00:00:22.010> down<00:00:22.039> till<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.550> next<00:00:22.730> plate

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
once you go down till the next plate

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.099 
once you go down till the next plate
he's<00:00:23.000> coming<00:00:23.240> back<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:23.539> you<00:00:23.630> gotta<00:00:23.779> build<00:00:23.990> up

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
he's coming back so you gotta build up

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.300 
he's coming back so you gotta build up
conditioning<00:00:24.650> because<00:00:25.010> he's<00:00:25.279> the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
conditioning because he's the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.740 
conditioning because he's the
quarterback<00:00:25.699> is<00:00:25.849> going<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.090> run<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.240> lot<00:00:26.420> he's

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
quarterback is going to run a lot he's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.560
