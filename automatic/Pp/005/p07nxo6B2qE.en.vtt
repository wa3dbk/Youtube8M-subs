costumes I have to go up a size because

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.529 
costumes I have to go up a size because
I<00:04:15.260> have<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.709> long<00:04:16.070> body<00:04:16.459> but<00:04:16.849> I<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.090> short<00:04:17.359> legs

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.569 
I have a long body but I have short legs
so<00:04:18.320> obviously<00:04:18.829> if<00:04:18.949> i'm<00:04:19.039> getting<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.340> swimming

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
so obviously if i'm getting a swimming

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.610 
so obviously if i'm getting a swimming
costume<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:20.120> need<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.419> go<00:04:20.570> up<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.930> size<00:04:20.959> because

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
costume I need to go up a size because

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.050 
costume I need to go up a size because
it<00:04:21.919> doesn't<00:04:22.250> quite<00:04:23.120> cover

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
it doesn't quite cover

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.470 
it doesn't quite cover
so<00:04:24.660> it's<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.020> 14<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.340> tummy<00:04:27.030> support

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
so it's in a 14 so the tummy support

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.200 
so it's in a 14 so the tummy support
isn't<00:04:27.740> doesn't<00:04:28.740> do<00:04:29.010> much<00:04:29.190> for<00:04:29.250> me<00:04:29.700> because

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
isn't doesn't do much for me because

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.390 
isn't doesn't do much for me because
it's<00:04:30.540> for<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.080> bigger<00:04:31.290> time<00:04:31.530> if<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.220> makes

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
it's for a bigger time if that makes

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.200 
it's for a bigger time if that makes
sense<00:04:32.580> um<00:04:33.470> but<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:35.310> haven't<00:04:35.730> tried<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.000> on<00:04:36.150> yet

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
sense um but I haven't tried it on yet

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.600
