just<00:00:35.410> got<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.769> fucking<00:00:36.489> faded<00:00:37.180> basically<00:00:37.660> faded

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
just got a fucking faded basically faded

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.479 
just got a fucking faded basically faded
quadfeed<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:38.500> wasn't<00:00:38.739> really<00:00:38.829> faded<00:00:39.129> it<00:00:39.339> was

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
quadfeed it wasn't really faded it was

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.069 
quadfeed it wasn't really faded it was
still<00:00:39.699> like<00:00:39.910> pretty<00:00:40.300> far<00:00:40.570> out<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.870> feed

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
still like pretty far out of the feed

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.869 
still like pretty far out of the feed
but<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.620> was<00:00:41.860> just<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.070> triple<00:00:42.430> kill<00:00:42.550> cam<00:00:42.760> and

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
but it was just a triple kill cam and

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.549 
but it was just a triple kill cam and
free<00:00:43.000> throw<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.449> it's<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.050> leftover

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
free throw and it's the leftover

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.290 
free throw and it's the leftover
obviously<00:00:45.070> but<00:00:45.309> I<00:00:45.519> thought<00:00:45.850> it<00:00:45.970> was<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.089> pretty

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
obviously but I thought it was a pretty

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.670 
obviously but I thought it was a pretty
awesome<00:00:46.510> clip<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:46.989> show<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.320> beginning<00:00:47.589> of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.670 
of enjoyment out of it so it's something
that<00:05:37.300> we<00:05:37.390> must<00:05:37.600> rather<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:38.020> doing<00:05:38.170> than<00:05:38.350> like

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
that we must rather be doing than like

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.920 
that we must rather be doing than like
just<00:05:39.100> having<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.670> regular<00:05:40.000> team<00:05:40.240> routine<00:05:40.630> and

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
what obey does that's different the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.490 
what obey does that's different the
other<00:05:43.210> clans<00:05:43.510> is<00:05:43.750> that<00:05:43.870> we<00:05:43.960> actually<00:05:44.110> play
