00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
future presidents so the question has

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.680 
future presidents so the question has
always<00:00:45.090> been<00:00:46.129> is<00:00:47.129> he<00:00:47.340> ready<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.390> kind<00:00:48.600> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
confidence I have a great confidence

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
confidence I have a great confidence
that<00:00:55.710> he's<00:00:55.920> sort<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.760> us<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that he's sort of gonna take us out of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
that he's sort of gonna take us out of
the<00:00:57.239> last<00:00:57.600> eight<00:00:57.780> years<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:59.309> we've<00:00:59.399> been

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the last eight years of what we've been

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
the last eight years of what we've been
experiencing<00:00:59.879> under<00:01:00.090> Bush<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:00.960> he'll

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
experiencing under Bush so I think he'll

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.360 
experiencing under Bush so I think he'll
really<00:01:01.289> follow<00:01:01.559> through<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.920> those<00:01:02.039> ideas
