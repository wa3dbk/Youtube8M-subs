like this this is my impression of like

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.100 
like this this is my impression of like
he's<00:02:21.000> being<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.330> smug<00:02:21.599> asshole<00:02:21.989> or

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
he's being like a smug asshole or

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.990 
he's being like a smug asshole or
something<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.519> they<00:02:23.610> go<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.760> commercial

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
