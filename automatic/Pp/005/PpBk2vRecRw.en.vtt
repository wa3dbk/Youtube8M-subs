00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you think about it everything on the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
you think about it everything on the
computer<00:01:56.579> has<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.060> displayed<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.630> some

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
computer has to be displayed at some

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
computer has to be displayed at some
point<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.890> going<00:01:59.070> through<00:01:59.310> your

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
point and that's all going through your

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.459 
point and that's all going through your
video<00:01:59.610> card<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.450> much<00:02:00.630> processing<00:02:01.140> speed

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
video card so as much processing speed

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.130 
video card so as much processing speed
as<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.700> end<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:03.540> video<00:02:03.840> card

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
as you have in the end your video card

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
as you have in the end your video card
is<00:02:04.320> what's<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.799> making<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.369> speed

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
is what's really making the speed

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.850 
is what's really making the speed
possible<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:06.600> accelerating<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> system<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
possible by accelerating the system and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.800 
possible by accelerating the system and
allowing<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> display<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> monitor<00:02:09.360> if

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
allowing it to display on the monitor if

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.290 
allowing it to display on the monitor if
you<00:02:10.470> increase<00:02:10.800> your<00:02:10.920> video<00:02:11.160> card<00:02:11.340> size<00:02:11.610> for

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
you increase your video card size for

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490 
you increase your video card size for
instance<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> 200

Sekhmet<00:02:13.890> video<00:02:14.100> card<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.000> go<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.450> 512

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
Sekhmet video card and you go to a 512

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.230 
Sekhmet video card and you go to a 512
megabyte<00:02:16.680> video<00:02:16.920> card<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:17.850> going<00:02:18.060> to
