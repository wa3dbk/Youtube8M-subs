axis movement and gave me precise

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.330 
axis movement and gave me precise
control<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.469> cameras<00:01:32.740> position<00:01:32.920> and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
control of the cameras position and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.889 
control of the cameras position and
angle<00:01:33.729> which<00:01:33.909> was<00:01:34.060> great<00:01:34.240> for<00:01:34.389> still<00:01:34.630> video

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
angle which was great for still video

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.840 
angle which was great for still video
but<00:01:35.409> although<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.619> could<00:01:35.920> attempt<00:01:36.219> pan<00:01:36.579> and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
but although I could attempt pan and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.520 
but although I could attempt pan and
tilt<00:01:37.090> shots<00:01:37.389> with<00:01:37.569> it<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.810> problem<00:01:38.170> was<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
tilt shots with it the problem was the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.410 
tilt shots with it the problem was the
footage<00:01:38.829> just<00:01:39.039> wasn't<00:01:39.399> particularly<00:01:39.670> smooth

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
footage just wasn't particularly smooth

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.330 
footage just wasn't particularly smooth
it<00:01:40.689> was<00:01:40.810> jittery<00:01:41.289> I<00:01:41.530> would<00:01:41.770> have<00:01:41.889> to<00:01:42.009> cut<00:01:42.189> large

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
it was jittery I would have to cut large

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.010 
it was jittery I would have to cut large
chunks<00:01:42.759> at<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.939> start<00:01:43.209> and<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.780> end<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.959> the

chunks at the start and the end of the
clip<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.409> post<00:01:44.709> to<00:01:45.069> hide<00:01:45.219> some<00:01:45.429> of<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.579> jerky

movement as I would apply pressure to
the<00:01:47.530> camera<00:01:47.829> basically<00:01:48.130> what<00:01:48.490> I<00:01:48.549> was<00:01:48.609> doing

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
the camera basically what I was doing

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.209 
the camera basically what I was doing
was<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.270> was<00:01:49.299> trying<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.899> videography<00:01:50.740> with

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
was I was trying to do videography with

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.699 
was I was trying to do videography with
a<00:01:51.270> photography<00:01:52.270> head<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:53.289> let<00:01:53.409> me<00:01:53.499> show<00:01:53.649> you

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
a photography head so let me show you

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.349 
a photography head so let me show you
the<00:01:53.979> difference<00:01:54.279> between<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.639> pan<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.209> tilt

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
the difference between a pan and tilt

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.840 
the difference between a pan and tilt
head<00:01:55.569> which<00:01:55.749> I<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:55.990> using<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.469> a<00:01:57.069> fluid<00:01:57.520> head

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
head which I was using and a fluid head

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.849 
head which I was using and a fluid head
as<00:01:57.999> you<00:01:58.479> can<00:01:58.569> see<00:01:58.749> panning<00:01:59.170> with<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.469> pan<00:01:59.709> and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
as you can see panning with the pan and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.949 
as you can see panning with the pan and
tilt<00:01:59.979> head<00:02:00.189> is<00:02:00.369> fine<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.209> serviceable<00:02:01.689> but

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
tilt head is fine it's serviceable but

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.899 
tilt head is fine it's serviceable but
it's<00:02:02.079> not<00:02:02.200> particularly<00:02:02.770> smooth<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:03.399> doesn't

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
it's not particularly smooth and doesn't

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.129 
it's not particularly smooth and doesn't
exactly<00:02:04.149> shout<00:02:04.509> quality

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
exactly shout quality

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.629 
exactly shout quality
there's<00:02:05.499> also<00:02:05.619> pretty<00:02:05.950> obvious<00:02:06.249> jitter<00:02:06.520> at

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
there's also pretty obvious jitter at

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.520 
there's also pretty obvious jitter at
the<00:02:06.700> start<00:02:06.969> and<00:02:07.149> stop<00:02:07.389> as<00:02:07.569> I<00:02:07.990> apply<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:08.349> and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
the start and stop as I apply it and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.529 
the start and stop as I apply it and
release<00:02:08.740> pressure<00:02:09.009> on<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.759> camera<00:02:10.090> now<00:02:10.330> for

release pressure on the camera now for

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.750 
release pressure on the camera now for
the<00:02:10.599> fluid<00:02:10.840> head<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.500> me<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.130> lot<00:02:12.340> smoother

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
the fluid head to me it's a lot smoother

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.160 
the fluid head to me it's a lot smoother
as<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.270> push<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.599> handle<00:02:13.930> there's<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
as I push the handle there's a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.570 
as I push the handle there's a
noticeable<00:02:14.470> resistance<00:02:15.069> which<00:02:15.280> gives<00:02:15.490> me

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
noticeable resistance which gives me

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.460 
noticeable resistance which gives me
greater<00:02:15.819> control<00:02:16.180> over<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.599> precise<00:02:16.930> speed

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
of the pan on the whole it's much nicer

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.060

in all my future videos so what's the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.240 
in all my future videos so what's the
difference<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.740> how

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
difference and how

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
tilt and fluid head and also add extra

someone who from makes videos everyday I
would<00:03:35.890> highly<00:03:36.190> recommend<00:03:36.220> investing<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:37.180> a

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
would highly recommend investing in a

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.850 
would highly recommend investing in a
fluid<00:03:37.660> head<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:37.900> your<00:03:38.019> tripod<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.680> don't

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
fluid head for your tripod if you don't

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.590 
fluid head for your tripod if you don't
already<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.160> one<00:03:39.370> obviously<00:03:40.269> this<00:03:40.390> is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
already have one obviously this is

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.630 
already have one obviously this is
easier<00:03:40.989> because<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.470> stationary<00:03:42.130> but<00:03:42.519> to

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
easier because this stationary but to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.180 
easier because this stationary but to
get<00:03:42.760> those<00:03:42.910> fancy<00:03:43.150> shots<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.660> get<00:03:43.750> those<00:03:43.900> nice

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
get those fancy shots to get those nice

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.350 
get those fancy shots to get those nice
panning<00:03:45.190> tilting<00:03:45.370> shots<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.880> your<00:03:45.970> subjects

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
panning tilting shots of your subjects

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.910 
panning tilting shots of your subjects
then<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.780> definitely<00:03:47.200> highly<00:03:47.320> recommend<00:03:47.410> one

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
then I definitely highly recommend one

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.350 
then I definitely highly recommend one
and<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.459> can<00:03:48.580> find<00:03:48.760> them<00:03:48.880> for<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.090> little<00:03:49.180> as

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
and you can find them for as little as

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.750 
and you can find them for as little as
50<00:03:49.780> pounds<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.410> as<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.010> try<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.250> improve<00:03:51.519> my
