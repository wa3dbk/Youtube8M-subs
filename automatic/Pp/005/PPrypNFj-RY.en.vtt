which way to go and you both do this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.660 
which way to go and you both do this
sort<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.960> awkward<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:23.830> dance<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.400> try<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
sort of awkward we all dance to try and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.880 
sort of awkward we all dance to try and
get<00:02:24.760> out<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.940> each<00:02:25.030> other's<00:02:25.300> way<00:02:25.480> well<00:02:26.200> never

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
get out of each other's way well never

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.920 
get out of each other's way well never
again<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.550> happen<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:28.090> found<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> best

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
again will this happen I found the best

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.960 
again will this happen I found the best
method<00:02:29.470> ever<00:02:29.680> been<00:02:30.100> using<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.400> months<00:02:30.670> it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
method ever been using it for months it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.600 
method ever been using it for months it
works<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.600> amazingly<00:02:32.110> all<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.800> have<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.160> is

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
works so amazingly all you have to do is

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.400 
works so amazingly all you have to do is
if<00:02:33.820> I'm<00:02:33.970> walking<00:02:34.180> towards<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.810> instead<00:02:35.350> of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
if I'm walking towards you instead of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.560 
if I'm walking towards you instead of
actually<00:02:35.830> making<00:02:35.950> eye<00:02:36.280> contact<00:02:36.310> just<00:02:37.120> look

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
actually making eye contact just look

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.030 
actually making eye contact just look
above<00:02:37.840> their<00:02:38.020> heads<00:02:38.230> you're<00:02:38.740> still<00:02:38.920> keeping

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
above their heads you're still keeping

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.130 
above their heads you're still keeping
everything<00:02:39.550> in<00:02:39.790> view<00:02:40.030> peripherally<00:02:40.750> but

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
everything in view peripherally but

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.570 
everything in view peripherally but
because<00:02:41.380> they<00:02:41.500> don't<00:02:41.709> see<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.070> looking<00:02:42.430> at

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
because they don't see you looking at

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.760 
because they don't see you looking at
then<00:02:42.970> they're<00:02:43.810> gonna<00:02:43.990> be<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.320> ones<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.650> move

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
then they're gonna be the ones to move

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.290 
then they're gonna be the ones to move
so<00:02:45.070> all<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.520> do<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.700> keep<00:02:45.910> walking

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
so all you have to do is keep walking

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.240 
so all you have to do is keep walking
and<00:02:46.420> then<00:02:46.600> move<00:02:46.750> out<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.050> way<00:02:47.170> might<00:02:47.980> seem<00:02:48.220> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and then move out that way might seem a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.040 
and then move out that way might seem a
little<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.580> rude<00:02:48.910> but<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.390> just<00:02:49.570> works<00:02:49.780> so

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
little bit rude but it just works so

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.110 
little bit rude but it just works so
well<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.440> both<00:02:50.590> parties<00:02:50.950> will<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.790> happy

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
well that both parties will be so happy

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.610 
well that both parties will be so happy
they<00:02:52.270> pointed<00:02:52.750> their<00:02:52.870> awkward<00:02:53.170> darkness<00:02:53.500> at

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
they pointed their awkward darkness at

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.300 
they pointed their awkward darkness at
it's<00:02:53.769> fine

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
it's fine

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.860 
it's fine
give<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> go<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:54.970> see<00:02:55.060> if<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.269> works<00:02:55.450> for<00:02:55.510> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.750 

the<00:02:58.870> cooler<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.290> banana<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.100> slower<00:03:00.430> it'll

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the cooler a banana is the slower it'll

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.820 
the cooler a banana is the slower it'll
ripen<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.690> like<00:03:01.870> your<00:03:02.080> bananas<00:03:02.620> and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
ripen so if you like your bananas and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.470 
ripen so if you like your bananas and
not<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.130> ripe<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.910> just<00:03:04.120> keeping<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
not that ripe and just keeping in the
