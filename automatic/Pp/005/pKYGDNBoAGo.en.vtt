00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.920 

yeah<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.530> did<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.309> did<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.520> did<00:00:41.700> war<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.270> years<00:00:42.570> ago

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
yeah I did I did I did war one years ago

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
yeah I did I did I did war one years ago
yeah<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.370> there's<00:00:44.489> any

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
yeah I don't think there's any

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.279 
yeah I don't think there's any
comparison<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:45.780> he's<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:45.960> do

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
comparison but for what he's gonna do

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.830 
comparison but for what he's gonna do
with<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.610> cuz<00:00:48.000> he's<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.510> he<00:00:48.660> wants

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
with it you know cuz he's gonna he wants

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
with it you know cuz he's gonna he wants
go<00:00:48.930> back<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> Hollis<00:00:52.820> everybody<00:00:53.820> wants<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
go back to the Hollis everybody wants to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.459 
go back to the Hollis everybody wants to
go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> small<00:00:54.629> enough<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.079> trailer

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
go to small enough that he can trailer

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.400 
go to small enough that he can trailer
so<00:00:55.680> he<00:00:55.770> doesn't<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.960> sail<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> way

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so he doesn't have to sail all the way

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.450 
so he doesn't have to sail all the way
there<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.070> know<00:01:00.620> well<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.859> understand<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
there you know well as I understand it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
there you know well as I understand it
there's<00:01:02.609> oniy<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:03.270> too<00:01:03.629> capricious<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
there's oniy like too capricious that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.750 
there's oniy like too capricious that
and<00:01:04.530> rocks<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.189> ever<00:01:05.339> been<00:01:05.430> built

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and rocks that have ever been built

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.270 
and rocks that have ever been built
right<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.590> correct<00:01:10.280> because

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
right so I think that's correct because

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
right so I think that's correct because
well<00:01:11.909> McCulloch<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.780> stopped<00:01:13.080> offering

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
