 poblano stuffed with mushrooms and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 that is a slight input to a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.870
 easier entry because then it comes 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.760
 the main course that is a little bit more 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 heavy is a monkey from today to aro but 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.650
 that is great but that is more 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.199
 heavy on the issue of chilies the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.329
 meat and all that then a ticket 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.999
 Well ligerita is these chilitos 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.909
 Pueblan filled mushrooms 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.859
 they are great excellent input or 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.870
 well if you want also for the snack 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.610
 to a snack a little lighter between 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.420
 week that many times we do not know that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.280
 prepare 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 Well these poblano chilitos 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.940
 Stuffed mushrooms are fabulous 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 what do you think if we go straight with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.520
 the ingredients so that you in 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.380
 home take note 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.810
 for these stuffed chilies we are going to 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.350
 need two tablespoons of oil 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.690
 taste 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.369
 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.720
 250 grams of oaxaca cheese in pieces 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.420

 half a tablespoons of chicken bouillon in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 powder and a little oil to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.730
 sauté our sauce we are already there what 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.340
 first thing we're going to do is I'm going to put 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.160
 who this pot chilies to be 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.920
 brown lightly with the onion 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.660
 the garlic the green tomatoes so 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.200
 let's put the best the extended 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.990
 now we get another one so we can see 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.360
 well and so that they are well browned here 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.460
 green tomatoes can be here in a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.240
 pot as I am doing 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.250
 in any comalito to burn 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.710
 we are going to lightly use them 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.450
 a few minutes to get them 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 that known as quemadito that also 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.920
 It gives a lot of flavor to our sauces 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.509
 so we're going to leave it out there and for 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.510
 another side let's start doing 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.610
 our filling for the filling is something 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.110
 super simple here in this pot we're going to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.000
 put a little oil of oil 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.920
 olive and let's sauté first the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.630
 onion water I know that always first of 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 the onion after the garlic because to 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.070
 because garlic burns very quickly 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.530
 and we can get to embitter our 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.410
 our saucer so we have here 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.780
 the finely chopped onion we are going to 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.190
 add garlic now 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.300
 the garlic that we have here also 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.640
 finely chopped 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:47.340
 and we add it and we are going to add 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.380
 now the mushrooms that can be 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.190
 filleted as I have them here or 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.470
 They may be 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.680
 finely chopped if they want to fill a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.510
 little bit more finite then 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.600
 only the mushrooms have 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.210
 finely chopped and ready now eye the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.820
 mushrooms to clean them in this 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.070
 occasion only with a damp cloth 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.110
 let's scrape is the top part and 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.120
 that way we're going to leave no 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.100
 let's put in water because it 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.620
 they moisten a lot and I do not want it to 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.450
 moisten so much is that we go here to 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.069
 add the mushrooms 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.700
 to be leaving also suffering 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.780
 together with the onion and the garlic 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.300
 let's give more to integrate everything 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.240
 so that they go cooking 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.470
 and let's now add a little bit of the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.600
 epazote and cheese oaxaca cheese or 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.530
 quesillo if you do not have to have more 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360
 quesillo can also work 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.580
 perfectly with chihuahua cheese with 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.280
 Manchego cheese also gives very good 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.780
 flavor and they are melting cheeses that 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.000
 they melt perfectly well and they 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.010
 They combine very well to be able to fill 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.350
 our poblanos peppers can 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
 stuff poblano chilies or they can 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.960
 be wide chiles either of the two 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.130
 the truth is also quite good and 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.300
 They combine very well with the sauce we're going 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.980
 to prepare let's feed lightly 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.390
 add the epazote we have here 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.540
 chopped 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.340
 and let's now add the cheese that 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.320
 I have cut into squares only 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.989
 to make it much easier to be 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.660
 integrate and melt here with the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.690
 preparation of the mushrooms so is 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.920
 that we give here to integrate cheese let's 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.930
 to leave here to melt 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.129
 that everything is perfectly integrated 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.360
 to then fill our peppers 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.069
 now the chilies that I am here I 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.919
 using today are the chilies 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.349
 poblanos poblano peppers remember 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.499
 that to use them you always have to 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.869
 peel them and unveil them and take away the 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.909
 little seeds inside and for this the most 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.830
 easy is to put them directly here in 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.449
 the burner in the fire so that it 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.519
 burn them to see that they burn down 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.339
 all sides after putting a bag 

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:01.439
 those with help and with the citadels 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.999
 go peeling the skin excites and goes to 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.119
 be much easier to remove the skin 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:07.830
 and now we are going to prepare 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:11.729
 our salsa sauce since we have 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.030
 the roasted tomatoes let's put the water 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:20.409
 the chicken powder consommé 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:23.050
 or whatever you want is right and let's go 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.239
 put our tomatoes in the blender 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.169
 green with onion young children 

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:31.330
 morita that we have here ready we are going to 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.069
 put the whole blender together first 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.599
 the liquids then the solid so that 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.249
 liquefies the blender a lot easier 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.539
 although let me tell you that truth is 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.159
 that with green tomatoes almost never 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.979
 have a problem because they have a lot of water 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.229
 It has a lot of humidity and usually the 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.449
 release then then live the blender 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.879
 it works perfectly well very 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.550
 easily here we have the garlic that 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.739
 also already burned a little bit took a 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.679
 golden color that you do not have much 

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:58.899
 the juve really suddenly the garlic 

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.579
 it can become very bitter 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:02.079
 saucers and we say that it is extra nice 

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:05.139
 and you can get the garlic that suddenly 

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:07.149
 we were burned then nothing more careful 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.679
 with that practically this dish already 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:12.069
 is ready the only thing we are going to do is 

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:14.439
 liquefy the sauce sauté the stuffed 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.169
 mints and serve them take them to the table 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:19.629
 accompanied by this rich sauce so 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.810
 we are practically ready, we are going to 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.620
 liquefy 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.060
 all this when it's hot on account 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.280
 that the steam can blow the lid off and 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.220
 you can burn like that is that nothing else a 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.600
 cloth that helps us sustain and we go 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.600
 to liquefy 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.930
 and heating a little bit of oil 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.760
 in our pot to fry 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.610
 our sauce 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.680
 and have it ready now let's see if here 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.830
 the cheese has already melted and has been integrated 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.630
 see how rich this little chick is 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.070
 filling many times we do not know from 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.200
 that fill the chilies and you can 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.150
 fill with countless things and can 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.920
 be as I tell you this post 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.470
 or also strong plate suddenly when 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.170
 we do not know that being of meat we can be 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.510
 Mushroom or flower stuffed peppers 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.130
 Pumpkin that also looks great 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.160
 the spirit of this dish a dish 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.160
 strong 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.830
 and variable 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.170
 protein of animal origin in meals 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.850
 it does not always have to be this way with 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.920
 protein of animal origin we are going to 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.420
 preaching the quotes can leave it here 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.000
 a few minutes and what do you think 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.230
 we go straight to a commercial court and 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.780
 we come back to finish these rich 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.880
 chiles and of course that monitoring already 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.960
 no but that's great, let's go for a 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.960
 cut we go back 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.570
 step by step of chilli stuffed with 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.190
 mushrooms for hot stuffing 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.020
 oil fry the onion with the garlic add 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.420
 the 8,000,000 kitchen for three minutes 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.100
 and seasoning to taste add the chopped epazote 

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.480
 and the cheese I cook a few more minutes 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.370
 fill the chiles with the mixture 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.960
 previous and reserve for the sauce 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.610
 tomato with garlic onion and chili 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.380
 morita liquefies with water and broth 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.330
 heat the oil fry the sauce and leave 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.490
 cook until lightly thickened 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.490
 offers the chiles bathed with the sauce
