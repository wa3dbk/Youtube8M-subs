right<00:04:58.070> i'm<00:04:58.100> hoping<00:04:58.460> i<00:04:58.550> don't<00:04:58.610> have<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:58.880> restore

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
right i'm hoping i don't have to restore

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.100 
right i'm hoping i don't have to restore
them<00:04:59.330> out<00:04:59.390> because<00:04:59.480> there's<00:04:59.690> so<00:04:59.840> much<00:04:59.930> effort

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
them out because there's so much effort

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.780 
them out because there's so much effort
to<00:05:00.260> do<00:05:00.410> that<00:05:00.440> ah<00:05:06.520> probably<00:05:07.520> should<00:05:07.700> have

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
to do that ah probably should have

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.070 
to do that ah probably should have
guessed<00:05:07.940> this<00:05:08.120> would<00:05:08.180> be<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.510> starting<00:05:08.810> area

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
guessed this would be the starting area

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.620 
guessed this would be the starting area
