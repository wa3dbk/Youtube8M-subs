00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
wax up for the first time of use I

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.990 
wax up for the first time of use I
didn't<00:03:21.160> believe<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.340> -<00:03:21.670> or<00:03:21.790> any

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
didn't believe that - or any

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.759 
didn't believe that - or any
instructions<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:22.630> yeah<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.900> did<00:03:23.049> take<00:03:23.500> pretty

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
instructions but yeah it did take pretty

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.800 
instructions but yeah it did take pretty
much<00:03:23.920> four<00:03:24.160> hours<00:03:24.400> for<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.569> able<00:03:25.660> to

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
much four hours for it to be able to

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.319 
much four hours for it to be able to
move<00:03:25.989> around<00:03:26.139> like<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.239> also

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
move around like this and but it also

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.920 
move around like this and but it also
says<00:03:28.720> after<00:03:28.989> 20<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.040> think<00:03:30.069> it's<00:03:30.340> 20<00:03:30.930> somewhat

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
says after 20 I think it's 20 somewhat

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.830 
says after 20 I think it's 20 somewhat
hours<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.530> use<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.609> wax<00:03:33.910> starts<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.450> lose<00:03:34.630> its

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
hours of use the wax starts to lose its

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.920 
hours of use the wax starts to lose its
colour<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.170> fade<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:36.220> um<00:03:36.639> at<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.599> moment<00:03:37.660> on

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
colour and fade so um at the moment on

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.330 
colour and fade so um at the moment on
the<00:03:37.959> camera<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:39.010> looks<00:03:39.370> pretty<00:03:40.269> washed<00:03:40.690> out

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340

the camera it looks pretty washed out
but<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.459> real<00:03:42.669> life<00:03:42.849> it's<00:03:43.120> actually<00:03:43.269> very<00:03:43.599> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
but in real life it's actually very a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.640 
but in real life it's actually very a
very<00:03:43.989> bright<00:03:44.739> vibrant<00:03:45.130> red<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:46.989> an<00:03:47.290> only
