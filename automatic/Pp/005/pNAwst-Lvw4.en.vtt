00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi everyone with you i mihail site 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.839
 reviewers yu.a. 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.059
 I remind you that this lesson comes out at 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.300
 support of scientific and production 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.730
 combining the harmony of the leader in vacuum 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 on plasma technology them separate 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.130
 thank you and we are in today's lesson 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 continue sculpturing review 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.359
 and consider a few brushes in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.689
 particular it will be grub or offset 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 smog brush or smoothing and and ralf &amp; 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.840
 lilas 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.719
 Know a little thought. I thought that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.420
 on the example of the teeth, we will not consider all 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.180
 the delights of sculpting since here until 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.660
 finished model already in principle by hand 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 to file 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.570
 so let's fantasize and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 think of something more interesting 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.820
 create a new document combination 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.180
 keys kontrol m 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.920
 add to our scene in the scope of settings 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.070
 spheres choose defffy hex and change drone 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.559
 view like this our sphere looks like it 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.479
 consists of a quad polygon that 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.210
 in general, we need to make it 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.930
 editable key 7 and add 3 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 division 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.350
 select the grab brush and tab 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.660
 symmetry activate the parameter xii-xv 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.380
 slightly increased our brush and draw out 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.380
 geometry 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 somewhere so let's see what happened 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.990
 well reduce our brush where so 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.990
 draw the geometry somewhere there 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 enough 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 that's what we got back area 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 it's something like cloaks like lizards 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.490
 the front area is like fangs but also in 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.100
 general it's like some kind of head 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.720
 incomprehensible alien creature 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.080
 actually this preparation and will 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.289
 blank for our subsequent work 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.680
 now let's change our look back 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:17.040
 Brush on the tab 7 3 activated x 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 stiffness 40 unwrap hey new object and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:27.080
 circus improvised eyes so 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.080
 let's add our own eyes 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.660
 something like this add a day and 3 to 6 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.560
 brush will do 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.560
 to max out 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.070
 and circle our lacoste 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.990
 So 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:59.390
 a little more will deploy action 20 here 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.780
 this section add division here 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.780
 That something like this 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.739
 that's what we have 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.859
 magician river 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.639
 and back to the crab brush players and here's 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.639
 such settings 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.079
 the size of the brush changes 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.359
 in the usual way but here unlike 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.120
 dota scan essence pressure element with 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.549
 using this brush we can enhance 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.709
 or shift do not forget that our 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.310
 the model must have sufficient 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.139
 by quantity 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.569
 polygons for full work 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.459
 Tool as in this case for 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.210
 this area will be very visible 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.850
 and convenient for editing 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.550
 if we go over for example first 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.130
 separation level we can do 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.950
 highlighting is not so pronounced but just 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.430
 slightly convex with no clear border 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.890
 it's more like a soft modification 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.780
 comparison for example with the imprint in 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.330
 depending on the goals works like this 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.730
 sometimes even better at low 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.490
 bureau their line with our size 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.140
 brushes we can either squeeze either 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.140
 squeeze the example like this 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:18.549
 go back and go back to level 6 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:23.110
 view changed 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.430
 and try to make strokes increase as 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.000
 brush 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.000
 will be kind 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.720
 and that's what we get with this example 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.390
 the differences in comparison with 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.420
 usual model we can change 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.490
 the form and such action is ordinary 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.110
 ways modeling would conclude 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.270
 yourself a whole chain of modification of polygons 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.200
 so this process has become more 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.440
 more comfortable and more comfortable if you can 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.440
 so to speak 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:16.129
 berger back let's expand our object 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.649
 activate q and add some relief 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.899
 somehow and even now some 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:23.270
 moments can be smoothed with a brush 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.470
 could she has similar settings with 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.750
 stamp 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.180
 and among other things very interesting 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.680
 flag option if its 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.250
 activate then the whole surface 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.410
 object some smoothing will occur 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.530
 proper name to brush says 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.570
 for itself well their example if we 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.210
 have done something and we need it 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.360
 will remove we can use the brush 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.720
 you so again activate symmetry and 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.540
 if we use plastic then this 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.930
 the brush will remove all actions to the very 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.230
 the base of the original object here we can 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.230
 remove 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.890
 this 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.530
 that's how it happens power is very 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.380
 very comfortable you should also remember that 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.270
 It works with the impression you can do 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.290
 prints or strokes across and along 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.210
 object lighting makes it possible as 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.580
 to pull out part of the surface 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.800
 both tools are somewhat similar but 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.110
 they need to be applied for various purposes 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.000
 For example work with a stamp in Odessa 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.150
 offset gives different results 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.430
 let's activate 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:36.860
 take symmetry 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:39.670
 activate the stamp this one too 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.670
 will do 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.490
 in displacement 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.390
 here is a vice we can operate with rotation 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:55.150
 and the size of our stamp for example to 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.110
 example , so here I take back 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.860
 and in displacement 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:06.080
 if we do like this we can only 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.080
 pull or press 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.590
 I think everything is clear with these moments 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:14.270
 so on this i will finish 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.120
 the next lesson we will proceed to 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.350
 considering other brushes for now let me remind you 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.050
 what is this lesson 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.130
 walks with support 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.710
 scientific production association fret 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.710
 leader in vacuum on plasma 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.080
 technology them special thanks to you 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.060
 I wish you all good luck with your own projects 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.800
 follow our updates and 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.800
 stay reviewers it
