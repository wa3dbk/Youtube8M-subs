00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 So now we know like a future like that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.980
 but basically it works 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.020
 interesting question is actually 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 another, namely, how to earn 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.650
 me money with such a part or where 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 are the ridden that under 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.940
 circumstances can lose money a future 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 is often as a contract 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.420
 designated and such a contract 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.920
 I can buy one, for example 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.779
 a bank or an investment 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.180
 society or a trader and one 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.430
 the easiest thing i can do is what is there 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 happens to be like a kind of thing 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.910
 money box yes i have one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 money box and this money box 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 is either filled with money or it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.329
 money is taken out and for ours 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.920
 For example, let us introduce ourselves 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.160
 have a contract on the dax 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.170
 bought the dax as a German stock index 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.510
 here serves as in this example 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.750
 underlying that is as a base value for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.980
 our future and in reality 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 it also so if i have one 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 dax-future think that's for every point 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.360
 I make amends in this dax-future 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 So that means when the dax rises 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.350
 I get 25 euros in mine 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.280
 money box so you can pay 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 imagine that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.560
 The problem is of course if I am now 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.619
 a point - I do that here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 red one point - it goes after 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.729
 below 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.619
 then also here 25 euro mine 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.450
 debited account that means that is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.580
 what made my money casket out 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 is pulled so if we are so 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.930
 Imagine that at the beginning of the day 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.610
 his money box is emptied or you 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 says so to speak at the end of the day 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 the smoothed out so I every day 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.280
 start again from the beginning and me 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.070
 consider the dax would have now 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 for example, so I draw this one 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.680
 one time 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.850
 that would have a very enjoyable turn 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.540
 behind him and at the end of the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.430
 day he would have made 50 points plus 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:54.360
 what would that mean 50 points plus na 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.920
 yes it would mean that I am here 1250 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.450
 would have done well 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.759
 that means my casket will be at the end 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 of the day with 1250 euro 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 to my favor nice thing filled 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.200
 profits are always nice but the thing 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.789
 Of course it can also be in the other one 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.349
 direction in which I am now 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.120
 for example, assume that I am here 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.650
 not 50 points plus but that makes 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.129
 me me 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.810
 50 points would mean yes 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.299
 just as we did this here 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.670
 this 1250 euro from me to the bank too 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.590
 would pay and if we assume 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.510
 that we had at the beginning of the day here 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 starting with zero euro is of course one 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.090
 quite an exciting question how come the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.329
 Bank to your money and the question becomes 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.739
 solved over a so-called margin the 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.049
 margin that is a so-called 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.670
 Safety performance the bank of me 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.739
 demands that I trade at all 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.769
 can drive it in this form, the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.659
 margin always has a specific one 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.849
 order of magnitude of capital and that is 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.099
 capital what I have to insert first 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.590
 before I can buy a future 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.810
 how is such a margin calculated well? 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.989
 So we have to imagine that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.269
 this future constructs what we have 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.159
 here would have a total value of 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.650
 For example, we take the dax 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.189
 would now have a value of 8000 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.680
 points 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.519
 in addition to 8000 points that in now 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.030
 we are not quite there yet 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.910
 then of course our future would have one 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.540
 total value of most will be fine 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.569
 have counted from 200,000 euro 8000 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.329
 25 times gives 200,000 euros and this 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.560
 200,000 euros would be the theoretical 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.359
 total risk of completely loss that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.159
 So if I now the dax-future 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.560
 Buy at the stand of 8,000 points 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.090
 who would rush down says began 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.680
 a day most likely not 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 but can happen this time for 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.239
 our example , I would have 200,000 euros 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.579
 afford to 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.870
 now 200,000 euros would be for the 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.909
 most probably a financial one 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.040
 Excessive demand therefore becomes the 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.139
 calculating such a margin something 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.109
 I calculated differently here 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:02.329
 again a dax curve and explain 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.489
 like such a margin of the 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.180
 bank is calculated the dax fluctuates 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.040
 and down 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.849
 also nina and the bank calculates about 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.430
 a certain period of time the so-called 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.560
 fluctuation range so imagine that 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.780
 in the dax most likely 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 will move within a day 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.409
 and let us assume for our example 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.330
 that would be a fluctuation of 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:27.220
 maybe a maximum of 400 points 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.830
 one expects to be in bank 400 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.030
 points that's the maximum up 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.870
 and can go down in one day 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.070
 and therefore the margin would be mine too 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.419
 calculated are the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.210
 safety performance I bring 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.360
 would be so in this example 425th 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.250
 that would be 10,000 euros which I as 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.950
 margin must deposit by one 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.380
 to act future one sees of course 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.020
 I can move capital in one 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.120
 but order of 200,000 euro must 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.130
 only 10,000 euros in this example as 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.780
 bring safety performance and in 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.910
 Reality is the margins too much 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.580
 much lower and that shows of course 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.020
 also that the danger in these 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.419
 Things are quite significant 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.070
 is and now it is in our example 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.110
 here still quite manageable 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.910
 but let's imagine there is 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.800
 quite definitely the own banks 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.290
 operate or for example also 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.960
 private investors do not have one now 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.090
 but keep contract, for example 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.760
 Holding 1,000 contracts then it is 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.800
 quite so that here every point in the dax 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.780
 25,000 euros and if now one 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.240
 Bank Eigenhandel operates its own 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.100
 traders and also with their own 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.690
 capital must finally be held 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.100
 so it can be quite 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.020
 be that such a trader with 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.820
 several thousand such contracts 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.350
 works and then when a scene 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.060
 Maybe they are totally involved 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.200
 was unforeseen as this flash 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.620
 we crashed not too long ago 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.240
 could see time on dow jones index 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.220
 then it can be quite so 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.979
 that here billions of damages arise 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.450
 within a short time 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.150
 especially if these people do not stop 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.490
 Otherwise, it is the same way 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.830
 that if so it is determined that 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.360
 the margin is no longer sufficient because 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.330
 maybe a situation occurred 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.610
 is the one the dealer or the one 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.470
 who did not buy the futures 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.300
 that means one has foreseen 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.440
 brand is no longer sufficient then the 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.169
 bank and that's the so-called 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.479
 margin call some then the fear 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.510
 sweaty beads on the head and drives 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.990
 makes you pale that means 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.300
 and if I have the 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.160
 can not fulfill the obligation of 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.220
 then the account is closed and 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.840
 I'm broke scenario what you look at 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.220
 does not wish, I hope that this has 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.930
 contributed a bit too 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.940
 explain like that with the futures 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.740
 works as always let me know 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.039
 what you think about it until the next one 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.039
 Video
