00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
their way but let me say this at one

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
their way but let me say this at one
point<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.890> developers<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.750> had

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
point these developers all of them had

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
point these developers all of them had
not<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.190> lost<00:00:50.430> their<00:00:50.700> way<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> it

not want have not lost their way and it

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.330 
not want have not lost their way and it
just<00:00:51.270> seems<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.020> sledgehammer<00:00:52.829> has<00:00:53.100> gone

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
just seems like sledgehammer has gone

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.939 
just seems like sledgehammer has gone
off<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> path<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.750> seemed<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.050> last<00:00:55.649> year

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
off the path it seemed like last year

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
off the path it seemed like last year
with<00:00:56.070> Infinity<00:00:56.579> Ward<00:00:56.820> making<00:00:57.449> ghost<00:00:57.629> they

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
with Infinity Ward making ghost they

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.619 
with Infinity Ward making ghost they
went<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> path<00:00:58.620> Treyarch<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.969> guys<00:01:00.180> have

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
went off the path Treyarch you guys have

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
went off the path Treyarch you guys have
made<00:01:00.899> black<00:01:01.530> ops<00:01:01.800> 1<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> my

made black ops 1 which is one of my

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
made black ops 1 which is one of my
favorite<00:01:03.510> call<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> duty's<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.470> had<00:01:05.129> them
