00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
rainiest late this is good for us all

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.360 
rainiest late this is good for us all
the<00:03:10.840> radiuses<00:03:11.590> because<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.550> can<00:03:12.730> see

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the radiuses because that you can see

the radiuses because that you can see
this<00:03:15.370> link<00:03:16.440> bars<00:03:17.760> bars<00:03:18.760> are<00:03:19.209> separated<00:03:19.930> we

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
this link bars bars are separated we

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.680 
this link bars bars are separated we
move<00:03:21.580> towards<00:03:22.030> 16<00:03:22.569> inch<00:03:22.920> radius<00:03:23.920> plate<00:03:24.690> you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
move towards 16 inch radius plate you

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.360 
move towards 16 inch radius plate you
can<00:03:25.930> see<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:28.120> bars<00:03:28.440> as<00:03:29.440> they<00:03:29.799> go<00:03:29.950> up<00:03:30.130> they

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
can see that the bars as they go up they

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.059 
can see that the bars as they go up they
are<00:03:30.549> closer<00:03:31.030> together<00:03:33.840> radius<00:03:34.840> plate<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.829> can

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
are closer together radius plate you can

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.330 
are closer together radius plate you can
see<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.420> bars<00:03:37.690> love<00:03:38.290> would<00:03:38.680> intersect

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
see that the bars love would intersect

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.619 
see that the bars love would intersect
here<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.690> why<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.440> 16<00:03:42.190> inch

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
here this is why this is a 16 inch

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.610 
here this is why this is a 16 inch

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
how you set up for a radius today we're

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.490 
how you set up for a radius today we're
going<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.670> just<00:04:50.880> set<00:04:51.120> up<00:04:51.300> for<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.600> forty<00:04:52.080> seven

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
going to just set up for a forty seven

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.480 
going to just set up for a forty seven
and<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.710> half<00:04:52.740> inch<00:04:53.220> radius<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:54.140> have<00:04:55.140> my<00:04:55.560> 16<00:04:56.190> inch

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
and a half inch radius I have my 16 inch

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.320 
and a half inch radius I have my 16 inch
radius<00:04:57.390> plate<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:59.390> the<00:05:00.390> base<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:02.280> we're<00:05:02.730> 16

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
radius plate on the base so we're 16

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.690 
radius plate on the base so we're 16
inches<00:05:04.230> to<00:05:04.560> our<00:05:04.590> first<00:05:05.450> pin<00:05:07.130> between<00:05:08.130> our<00:05:08.370> kids

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
inches to our first pin between our kids

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.900 
inches to our first pin between our kids
we<00:05:08.970> have<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> two<00:05:09.450> inch<00:05:09.660> increment<00:05:10.350> so<00:05:11.340> we<00:05:11.670> take

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
we have a two inch increment so we take

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.590 
we have a two inch increment so we take
the<00:05:12.180> 16<00:05:12.810> as<00:05:13.230> you<00:05:13.680> can<00:05:13.890> see<00:05:14.160> these<00:05:14.460> are<00:05:14.700> our<00:05:14.970> good

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
interlocking unit and we put our zero

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.250 
interlocking unit and we put our zero
peg<00:05:36.780> on<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:38.400> 30<00:05:39.770> we<00:05:40.770> are<00:05:40.920> at<00:05:41.070> 46<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.750> ruler

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
that comes with the machine you put it

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.010 
that comes with the machine you put it
you<00:05:47.400> put<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:47.760> all<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.060> way<00:05:48.090> back<00:05:48.360> on<00:05:48.690> your

with turning the shop we are looking to

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.020 
with turning the shop we are looking to
get<00:05:58.320> an<00:05:58.530> extra<00:05:58.920> inch<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.490> half<00:05:59.870> from<00:06:00.870> our<00:06:01.140> 46

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
get an extra inch and a half from our 46

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.690 
get an extra inch and a half from our 46
that<00:06:03.030> will<00:06:03.360> get<00:06:03.600> us<00:06:03.630> 247<00:06:04.470> and<00:06:05.100> a<00:06:05.220> half<00:06:05.400> inch

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
that will get us 247 and a half inch

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.760 
that will get us 247 and a half inch
radius<00:06:08.390> with<00:06:09.390> adjusting<00:06:10.020> this<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.470> an<00:06:10.590> inch
