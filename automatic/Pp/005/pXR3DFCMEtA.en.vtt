00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 because we already have hake no matter what 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.990
 be fresh or frozen a little bit of salt 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.050
 on the one hand on the other hand a little bit of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.059
 get out there is more where you think not 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.960
 what I want ground pepper a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.449
 little bit that's the way it is, it 's already there 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 do this a clean cloth like this one that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.710
 be here that will be clean freshly 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.340
 washed some freshly dried and do this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.050
 then it is this that makes this 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.179
 does the bottom part only 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.619
 directly to the flour the line that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.980
 we go for the start platita 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.200
 Okay it's here like this once it's okay 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.989
 flour and is one and so on 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 all fine flour salt flour for all 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.960
 parts 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 and usually it's always served in a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.590
 clay pot can be made in a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 pan and pass it to the casserole because today 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 the clay pot closed almost all 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.949
 I do not know why but closed 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 He always used the oven in the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.170
 of the kitchen oven from the pull to the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 table but today sometimes it gets and cracks 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.120
 because half 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.040
 and the same is the same I have seen as 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.870
 it would be dry if the flour would not be 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.690
 in for pastures from which it is mixed 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.150
 and splashes the oil but does not splash 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.800
 oil and at the same time we bring you a 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 little bit more pepper than good as 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.970
 with the oil is already a large skillet 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.920
 or do not walk and then we will serve the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.619
 small clay pot oil 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.270
 fry and make it like half 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.720
 this flour for use in the car 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.030
 because what I do 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.700
 in my case 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.070
 we are going to see the habits the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200
 garlic cloves easier to have it peel 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.080
 now through whoever takes a good 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.360
 Basque hake casserole concluded 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.290
 besides you already know habit 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.420
 very simple in which there is no need 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.700
 that burn the side units with 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.080
 law for another and now with this over here 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.080
 some before big team 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.630
 Well, how are we going to do what is 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.069
 a reaction nothing else we go a little 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.069
 this little thing like this 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.260
 and so I want to present what is the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.330
 narration nothing else there is worth that district 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.280
 that is there now 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.730
 we put this in there makes him go 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.800
 warming up and we're going to take a medallion 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.780
 cited hake like this one that is here 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.910
 all the same give him a little one that 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.660
 fit this one here we raise it ay 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.250
 in this also so maybe that's going to 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.810
 stay there we have hard boiled eggs and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 you have to put a cold water on it I have 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.700
 but I got well because no peeling 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.650
 nothing happens in trouble as it is for 11 and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.170
 so much that I already have them here 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.240
 thawed because there is not fresh 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.240
 right now so one 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.380
 some clams are here one needs a 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.380
 over there and another one over here 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.140
 is already a pimiento gambitas pimiento 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.739
 must carry I'm not just going to put 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.510
 because I already said it in the recipe it's worth 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.950
 their habitats that are many because 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.440
 we remove what we need 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.440
 you have to be recording 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.950
 this is total we have to go finishing 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.830
 because here and I go to the credit here 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.010
 come on the caldito look what piece I 'm charging 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:34.880
 by carlos bilardo de marisco 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.620
 and yes a little bit of that one there 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.620
 his revenue is missing 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.319
 on Thursday and we're leaving 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.280
 and now in the center your record is not going to 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:06.080
 stay so it's too hot 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:08.060
 there are good 25 is asking for forest but 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.010
 I forgot the same time too 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.080

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.330
 from here from here in the cortito to 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.880
