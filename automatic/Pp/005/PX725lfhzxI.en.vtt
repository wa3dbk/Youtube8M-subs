right here I get my second V set the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.290 
right here I get my second V set the
best<00:01:26.380> way<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.560> use<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.979> hammer<00:01:27.190> in<00:01:27.460> my<00:01:27.520> opinion

best way to use the hammer in my opinion

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.150 
best way to use the hammer in my opinion
is<00:01:28.480> whether<00:01:28.990> you're<00:01:29.260> using<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.620> with<00:01:29.740> start<00:01:30.100> I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
is whether you're using it with start I

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.350 
is whether you're using it with start I
mean<00:01:30.340> stock<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.820> irrelevant

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
mean stock is irrelevant

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.360 
mean stock is irrelevant

I like stock because I like to rush not

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.860 
I like stock because I like to rush not
everybody's<00:01:33.970> gonna<00:01:34.060> be<00:01:34.300> able<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.540> rush<00:01:34.690> with

this<00:01:35.020> weapon<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.310> best<00:01:36.940> way<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.690> fire<00:01:38.140> it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
this weapon the best way to fire it

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.640 
this weapon the best way to fire it
though<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.400> this<00:01:39.550> is<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.760> real<00:01:39.910> key<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.330> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
though and this is the real key to it is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.500 
though and this is the real key to it is
firing<00:01:41.650> bursts<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.370> five<00:01:42.580> four<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.330> five

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
firing bursts of five four to five

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.230 
firing bursts of five four to five
bullets<00:01:43.870> at<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.140> time<00:01:44.440> first<00:01:44.770> fire<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.970> hammer

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
bullets at a time first fire the hammer

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.970 
bullets at a time first fire the hammer
try<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.750> get<00:01:46.930> on<00:01:47.050> target<00:01:47.470> with<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.710> first

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
try to get on target with the first

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.430 
try to get on target with the first
three<00:01:48.370> bullets<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.630> by<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.930> time<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
three bullets so that by the time the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.610 
three bullets so that by the time the
fire<00:01:50.650> rate<00:01:50.890> slows<00:01:51.160> down<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:53.470> what

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
fire rate slows down because what

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.930 
fire rate slows down because what
happens<00:01:53.860> with<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.070> hammer<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.610> has<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.730> high

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
happens with the hammer is it has a high

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.520 
happens with the hammer is it has a high
fire<00:01:55.210> rate<00:01:55.420> for<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.690> first<00:01:55.870> couple<00:01:56.140> bullets

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
fire rate for the first couple bullets

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.110 
fire rate for the first couple bullets
and<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.920> slows<00:01:57.159> down<00:01:57.190> so<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:58.000> have

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
and then it slows down so that you have

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.420 
and then it slows down so that you have
better<00:01:58.330> long-range<00:01:58.870> accuracy<00:01:59.290> but<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.250> don't

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
better long-range accuracy but you don't

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.680 
better long-range accuracy but you don't
want<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.610> use<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.730> that<00:02:00.940> way<00:02:01.090> just<00:02:01.240> do<00:02:01.480> it<00:02:01.600> like

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
want to use it that way just do it like

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.840 
want to use it that way just do it like
I<00:02:01.810> said<00:02:01.870> burst<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.740> firing<00:02:03.310> bursts<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.670> five

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
I said burst it firing bursts of five

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.670 
I said burst it firing bursts of five
which<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.600> know<00:02:04.720> plenty<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.230> kill<00:02:05.440> someone

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
which is you know plenty to kill someone

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.580 
which is you know plenty to kill someone
and<00:02:05.950> then<00:02:06.610> don't<00:02:06.820> let<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.150> slow<00:02:07.450> down<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:08.019> fire

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
and then don't let it slow down and fire

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.770 
and then don't let it slow down and fire
rate<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.039> just<00:02:09.220> keep<00:02:09.369> bursting<00:02:09.879> if<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.390> happen

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
rate so just keep bursting if you happen

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.649 
rate so just keep bursting if you happen
to<00:02:10.950> run<00:02:11.950> into<00:02:12.010> multiple<00:02:12.580> enemies<00:02:12.970> try<00:02:13.599> to

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
to run into multiple enemies try to

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.800 
to run into multiple enemies try to
burst<00:02:14.230> five<00:02:14.739> kill<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> first<00:02:15.519> guy<00:02:15.810> re-aim

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
burst five kill the first guy re-aim

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.750 
burst five kill the first guy re-aim
down<00:02:17.080> sight<00:02:17.379> because<00:02:17.739> when<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.040> re<00:02:18.310> aim<00:02:18.550> down

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
down sight because when you re aim down

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.020 
down sight because when you re aim down
sight<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.269> activate<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.530> aim<00:02:21.069> assist<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
sight you activate the aim assist the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.699 
sight you activate the aim assist the
game<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.450> game<00:02:22.599> engines<00:02:22.930> aim<00:02:23.080> assist<00:02:23.290> again

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
game the game engines aim assist again

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.380 
game the game engines aim assist again
so<00:02:23.890> it'll<00:02:24.040> lock<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.610> next<00:02:24.879> target<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
so it'll lock on to the next target and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.970 
so it'll lock on to the next target and
then<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> burst<00:02:26.140> them<00:02:26.319> again<00:02:26.560> with<00:02:26.799> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
then you burst them again with the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
then you burst them again with the
higher<00:02:27.700> fire<00:02:28.090> rate<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.659> that's<00:02:29.440> what<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.680> found

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
higher fire rate so that's what I found

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.500 
higher fire rate so that's what I found
works<00:02:30.190> really<00:02:30.430> good<00:02:30.640> with<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.879> hammer<00:02:31.090> burst

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
works really good with the hammer burst

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.000 
works really good with the hammer burst
of<00:02:31.720> five<00:02:31.870> even<00:02:32.350> if<00:02:32.470> you're<00:02:32.590> playing<00:02:32.800> from

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
of five even if you're playing from

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.510 
of five even if you're playing from
distance<00:02:33.550> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
distance and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.160 
distance and
kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.760> playing<00:02:34.970> more<00:02:35.150> reserved<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.930> I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
kind of playing more reserved and I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.620 
kind of playing more reserved and I
guess<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.830> called<00:02:37.070> campy<00:02:37.490> bursting<00:02:38.450> five

scavenger<00:05:56.710> but<00:05:57.160> that's<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.430> problem<00:05:57.670> with

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
scavenger but that's the problem with

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.520 
scavenger but that's the problem with
the<00:05:57.970> hammer<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.450> if<00:05:58.660> you<00:05:58.780> notice<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.230> start

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
the hammer is if you notice you start

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.860 
the hammer is if you notice you start
out<00:05:59.650> with<00:06:00.130> 75<00:06:00.700> bullets<00:06:01.150> now<00:06:01.300> what<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:01.690> game

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
out with 75 bullets now what the game

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.130 
out with 75 bullets now what the game
engine<00:06:02.170> does<00:06:02.590> is<00:06:02.860> for<00:06:03.820> your<00:06:04.000> additional<00:06:04.810> ammo

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
engine does is for your additional ammo

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.780 
engine does is for your additional ammo
count<00:06:05.380> it<00:06:05.560> takes<00:06:05.770> your<00:06:05.980> starting<00:06:06.340> clip<00:06:06.580> and

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
count it takes your starting clip and

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.150 
count it takes your starting clip and
times<00:06:07.300> is<00:06:07.480> it<00:06:07.630> by<00:06:07.750> two<00:06:07.810> so<00:06:08.380> if<00:06:08.470> you<00:06:08.560> have<00:06:08.740> 75

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
times is it by two so if you have 75

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.030 
times is it by two so if you have 75
bullets<00:06:09.670> you're<00:06:10.090> only<00:06:10.270> gonna<00:06:10.540> get<00:06:11.040> 150
