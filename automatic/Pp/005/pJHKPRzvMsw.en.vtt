guitar<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.589> going<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.070> drop<00:00:46.280> D<00:00:46.489> and

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
guitar is going to be in drop D and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.829 
guitar is going to be in drop D and
we're<00:00:46.730> just<00:00:46.820> going<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.059> show<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.480> around<00:00:47.629> a

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
we're just going to show you around a

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.259 
we're just going to show you around a
little<00:00:47.870> bit<00:00:48.080> here<00:00:48.260> turn<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.220> pedal<00:00:49.430> off<00:00:49.580> this

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
little bit here turn the pedal off this

00:00:50.269 --> 00:01:02.910 
little bit here turn the pedal off this
is<00:00:50.390> your<00:00:50.480> clean<00:00:50.690> tone

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.490 

so<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:03.980> can<00:01:04.100> tell<00:01:04.220> there's<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.430> lot<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:05.540> gain<00:01:06.290> on

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
so you can tell there's a lot of gain on

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.140 
so you can tell there's a lot of gain on
this<00:01:06.680> pedal<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:07.340> can<00:01:07.460> save<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.730> to<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.880> 12

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
this pedal you can save it to the 12

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.370 
this pedal you can save it to the 12
clock<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.540> can't<00:01:08.780> really<00:01:08.870> see<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.110> knob

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
clock you can't really see the knob

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.750 
clock you can't really see the knob
dials<00:01:10.010> but<00:01:10.220> they're<00:01:10.610> there<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:12.670> starting<00:01:13.670> it

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
dials but they're there so starting it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400 
dials but they're there so starting it
off<00:01:13.850> there's<00:01:14.060> mix<00:01:14.420> knob<00:01:14.600> up<00:01:14.840> here<00:01:15.050> which

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
off there's mix knob up here which

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.710 
off there's mix knob up here which
controls<00:01:15.830> how<00:01:16.340> much<00:01:16.370> of<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.240> grit<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.600> can

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
controls how much of the grit you can

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.410 
controls how much of the grit you can
get<00:01:17.840> it

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.219 

Oh

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.599 

so<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.829> set<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> around<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.490> o'clock

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
so I like to set it around one o'clock

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.010 
so I like to set it around one o'clock
because<00:01:33.179> that<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.539> can<00:01:33.750> look<00:01:33.899> at<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
because that way you can look at that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.469 
because that way you can look at that
some<00:01:34.289> clarity<00:01:34.770> without<00:01:35.070> having<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> without

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
some clarity without having that without

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
some clarity without having that without
having<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.079> kicked<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.469> because<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
having to get kicked in because it is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:52.609 
having to get kicked in because it is
variegated<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.670> show<00:01:38.819> you<00:01:38.909> here

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.410 

hey

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.770 

and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.540 

so<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:06.110> still<00:02:06.260> have<00:02:06.410> every<00:02:06.980> day<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.190> just

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
so you can still have every day is just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.400 
so you can still have every day is just
by<00:02:07.640> shutting<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.000> gain<00:02:08.180> all<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.390> way<00:02:08.570> up

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
by shutting the gain all the way up

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.750 
by shutting the gain all the way up
mmm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.600 

of<00:02:16.760> course<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> sizzle<00:02:17.600> which<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.140> down<00:02:18.290> here

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
of course the sizzle which is down here

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.760 
of course the sizzle which is down here
changes<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:19.760> pretty<00:02:20.750> much<00:02:20.900> how<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.170> effect

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
changes on pretty much how the effect

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.860 
changes on pretty much how the effect
kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.100> works<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.550> how<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> how<00:02:23.600> much<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
kind of works like how to how much the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:33.780 
kind of works like how to how much the
fizzles

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.440 

of<00:02:34.510> course<00:02:34.719> the<00:02:34.810> middle<00:02:34.989> one<00:02:35.079> is<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> volume

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
of course the middle one is the volume

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.300 
of course the middle one is the volume
so<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.689> fun<00:02:37.900> pal<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.920> not<00:02:39.069> for

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
so that's a fun pal it's not for

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.520 
so that's a fun pal it's not for
everybody<00:02:39.579> but<00:02:39.969> it's<00:02:40.569> really<00:02:40.840> cool<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.439> if

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
everybody but it's really cool and if

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.349 
everybody but it's really cool and if
you<00:02:41.590> give<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.859> a<00:02:41.920> chance<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.909> can<00:02:43.060> get<00:02:43.209> some

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
you give it a chance you can get some

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.129 
you give it a chance you can get some
really<00:02:43.689> really<00:02:44.019> neat<00:02:44.319> toes
