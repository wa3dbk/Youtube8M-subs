let's<00:01:03.230> do<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.530> wood<00:01:03.800> texture<00:01:04.160> so<00:01:04.670> it's<00:01:04.880> like

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
let's do the wood texture so it's like

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.360 
let's do the wood texture so it's like
this<00:01:05.270> white<00:01:05.540> arrow<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.200> slits<00:01:06.979> down<00:01:07.130> arrow

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
this white arrow and slits down arrow

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.650 
this white arrow and slits down arrow
and<00:01:07.690> on<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:09.020> RGB<00:01:09.950> spectrum<00:01:10.490> change<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.479> to

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
and on the RGB spectrum change it to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.570 
and on the RGB spectrum change it to
image<00:01:12.670> now<00:01:14.350> go<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.410> where<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:15.920> saved<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.310> mines

right now go back to where you where you
can<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.090> textures<00:01:48.729> now<00:01:49.729> let's<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.810> for

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
can see the textures now let's do it for

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.330 
can see the textures now let's do it for
the<00:01:51.550> bump<00:01:53.049> so<00:01:54.049> same<00:01:54.500> thing<00:01:54.530> change<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.250> to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
the bump so same thing change it to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.660 
the bump so same thing change it to
image<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.170> put<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.409> bump<00:01:58.210> and<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:01.130> want<00:02:01.400> you

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
image and put it to bump and I want you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
then to get the same scale from your

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.830 
then to get the same scale from your
diffuse<00:02:04.690> I'm<00:02:05.690> sure

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.680 

oops<00:02:09.840> let's<00:02:10.650> just<00:02:10.830> change<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
oops let's just change it to there so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.720 
oops let's just change it to there so
get<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.960> same<00:02:13.170> scale<00:02:13.560> number<00:02:14.250> from<00:02:14.520> your

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
get the same scale number from your

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.680 
get the same scale number from your
diffuse<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:16.910> paste<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.150> into<00:02:18.360> your<00:02:18.920> bump<00:02:19.920> one

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
diffuse and paste it into your bump one

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.180 
diffuse and paste it into your bump one
and<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.780> shouldn't<00:02:22.080> match<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.530> now<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.070> is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and it shouldn't match it now that is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.550 
and it shouldn't match it now that is
way<00:02:23.370> too<00:02:23.400> powerful<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:26.280> turn<00:02:26.670> down<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:27.180> notch
