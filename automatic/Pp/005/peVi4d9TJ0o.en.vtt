00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
looking at it i watch the trailer is one

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.509 
looking at it i watch the trailer is one
thing<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.560> I've<00:02:33.799> noticed<00:02:33.829> is<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
thing that I've noticed is that the

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.640 
thing that I've noticed is that the
trailer<00:02:34.819> defonce<00:02:35.299> were<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.569> in<00:02:35.750> English<00:02:35.930> so

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
trailer defonce were all in English so

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.679 
trailer defonce were all in English so
this<00:02:37.099> could<00:02:37.400> very<00:02:37.459> much<00:02:37.879> be<00:02:38.060> perhaps<00:02:38.480> a

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
this could very much be perhaps a

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.080 
this could very much be perhaps a
Western<00:02:39.049> release<00:02:39.290> hopefully<00:02:40.280> they<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.760> maybe

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
Western release hopefully they can maybe

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.819 
Western release hopefully they can maybe
make<00:02:41.359> it<00:02:41.420> work<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.079> video<00:02:42.349> as<00:02:42.439> well<00:02:42.469> but

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
make it work for the video as well but

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.379 
make it work for the video as well but
we<00:02:42.980> don't<00:02:43.159> know<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.280> yet<00:02:43.489> I'm<00:02:43.849> just<00:02:44.120> excited
