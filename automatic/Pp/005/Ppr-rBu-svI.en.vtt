00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.570
 yes hello dear play guitarist 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.700
 today again a new video for 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.480
 you and I would like to have one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.639
 new lesson fire opened or 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.070
 the beginner course at different stroke 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 complement the pattern 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.079
 I had to hit different times 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.450
 already I have already in 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.800
 beginner course already explained I would like 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.380
 just do it again lost states 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 for you want to do without one 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.680
 small reporter for you build up so 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.689
 that there are always different shocks here 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.730
 We'll start to handle mother today 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.269
 a very simple pattern and indeed 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's all just haircuts and 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.719
 to get my feeling like you 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 I recommend you to refuse 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.129
 ever to count that is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.710
 simply 1234 and beat accordingly 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.390
 always on the number of times just off 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 I grab the gak here and not 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.320
 always to play with and start 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.320
 namely 13 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.509
 that's how it is going to be and indeed 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.340
 slowly 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.790
 No 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 2 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 34 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.510
 12 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.510
 3 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 Here's a tip if I'm here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.600
 still asked how can you do it the best 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.370
 to practice handling the case 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.970
 Of course , it's clear at the beginning 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.750
 difficult to grasp the same chords 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.260
 that is quite normal 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.120
 over the gak 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 you want the offers 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.300
 Can you do crazy? 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.520
 we have not been so fluent since I do 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.970
 the following so from ge on the moon 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 change 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.570
 2 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.570
 I should 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 12 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.830
 Now I know that it is difficult 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.840
 why it must prove human as at 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 jesse d aqui makes poverty 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.780
 you have the following like for example 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 already mentioned the gak used 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.650
 hit right house 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.650
 the tempo continues 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.690
 when he is in the round 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.450
 be through 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.450
 but it is not the right hand 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 Just take your finger off the chord 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.550
 successively 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.550
 his 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.760
 m 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.520
 first time writing work 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.520
 it will give up the same thing 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.160
 heinz 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.160
 2 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.060
 Hi 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.420
 2 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.420
 there 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.719
 yes , this is the best try this time 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.629
 You can do that with different authors 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.829
 Try any chord once 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.930
 what I want out of this is this 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.790
 just tried that though 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.980
 difficult to start the choice 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.970
 Just change the right hand 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.000
 to run 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.790
 best i should be now i can 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.120
 keep a few in mind 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.120
 right 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.830
 12 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.580
 No 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.120
 No 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.120
 2 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.950
 very good 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.740
 the 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.689
 12 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.970
 2 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.180
 there 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.180
 june to turn up again 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.180
 12 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.670
 there 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.780
 and so on and so forth I think that 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.060
 maybe a good exercise 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.349
 Of course, a tip from me in the dark 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.519
 practice I have already in the forum 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.140
 mentioned on the times or on the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.580
 website may sound 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.620
 a bit weird at times 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.599
 if the rollos has or the like 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.430
 to do it and then just try it 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.680
 for example, two three chords 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.720
 just a pressure to grab 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.820
 the insecurity by light turn on 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.970
 Otherwise, just look 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.169
 Diakon try to grab me 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.580
 now here just to access without 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:36.150
 So then to strike de times the gdp 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.009
 the c whichever Kolle just on 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.440
 In the beginning it is important that they are liquid 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.699
 embrace the battery and learn 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.789
 her accordingly with such exercises 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.110
 even though it's basically a reason to do that 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.100
 first strike pattern I think so 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.169
 go much closer 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.870
 You can still be on the edge if you 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.240
 trying to learn titles no matter what 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.070
 Chords always try always first 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.889
 with this blow pattern this title 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.330
 I do not know that 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.960
 Now I need to take for example 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.960
 feldmann round of 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.930
 just try it first time 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.060
 strike and also beat off slowly 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.600
 it makes no sense if you are a stone 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.600
 models 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.210
 which in the end no one at all 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.220
 makes sense and totally wrong with that 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.290
 respective title so if you have a title 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.070
 you will attack them collide 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.960
 always needs and beat 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.000
 take off and then go up 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.710
 the whole then it takes the takes 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.060
 Next the next step must be with 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.340
 Rhine he accordingly then at 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.720
 every title then also gets so 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.400
 If you ask for this blow 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.919
 pattern the first punch had to be made from the 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.960
 series as discounts of a nominal and 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.150
 the post e guitar is playing or 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.350
 look at the forum over there you can 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.750
 ask your question 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.490
 there are many users who like you far 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.970
 So hang up until the next one 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.970
 hit the counter
