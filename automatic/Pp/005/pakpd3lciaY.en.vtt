hi<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.290> mrs.<00:00:01.740> Swanson<00:00:02.000> today<00:00:03.000> I'm

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi guys this is mrs. Swanson today I'm

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.450 
hi guys this is mrs. Swanson today I'm
going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.449> cover<00:00:03.810> cross<00:00:04.410> contour<00:00:05.040> with<00:00:05.279> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
going to cover cross contour with you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.120 
going to cover cross contour with you
guys<00:00:05.670> before<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> begin<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.200> your<00:00:07.290> next

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
guys before you begin on your next

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.930 
guys before you begin on your next
project

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
project

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.190 
project
so<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:10.110> begin<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.980> terms<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.030> art<00:00:12.330> line<00:00:12.929> is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
so to begin in terms of art line is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.010 
so to begin in terms of art line is
defined<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.340> moving<00:00:14.670> dot<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.450> see<00:00:15.660> in

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
defined as a moving dot as you see in

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.560

the upper left hand corner of your
screen<00:00:18.710> line<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.830> perhaps<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.310> most<00:00:20.490> basic<00:00:21.060> of

screen line is perhaps the most basic of

the seven elements of art line is of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.839 
the seven elements of art line is of
also<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> fundamental<00:00:25.140> part<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> drawing

also a fundamental part of drawing

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.040 
also a fundamental part of drawing

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
at a few of the ways that you can use

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.819 
at a few of the ways that you can use

when line is used in this way the lines

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
when line is used in this way the lines
are<00:00:45.899> called<00:00:46.079> contour<00:00:47.010> lines<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
are called contour lines which is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
are called contour lines which is
something<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.360> cover<00:00:48.629> during<00:00:49.160> drawing

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that I would like to show you two just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.040 
that I would like to show you two just
to<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.610> show<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> difference

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
to kind of show you the difference

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.440 
to kind of show you the difference
between<00:02:52.170> using<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.220> basic<00:02:53.310> contour<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
between using just basic contour and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.140 
between using just basic contour and
also<00:02:55.110> using<00:02:55.410> cross<00:02:55.620> contour<00:02:56.160> line<00:02:56.370> plungers

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
also using cross contour line plungers

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.180 
also using cross contour line plungers
here<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.989> two<00:03:01.440> very<00:03:01.770> similar

here so here we have two very similar

the<00:03:09.810> shadows<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.500> highlights<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.130> forth

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the shadows and highlights and so forth

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.580 
the shadows and highlights and so forth
within<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> form<00:03:12.050> this<00:03:13.050> gives<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> illusion

lastly<00:04:51.629> notice<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.139> line<00:04:52.349> variation<00:04:53.099> as<00:04:53.370> I've

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
lastly notice the line variation as I've

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.850 
lastly notice the line variation as I've
shown<00:04:54.120> here<00:04:54.360> with<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.479> purple<00:04:54.780> air<00:04:55.020> arrows<00:04:55.560> it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
shown here with the purple air arrows it

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.860 
shown here with the purple air arrows it
gets<00:04:56.430> thicker<00:04:56.729> along<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.150> edges<00:04:57.569> where<00:04:57.599> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
gets thicker along the edges where the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.719 
gets thicker along the edges where the
form<00:04:58.289> is<00:04:58.500> either<00:04:58.710> thicker<00:04:59.069> or<00:04:59.370> covered<00:04:59.699> with

form is either thicker or covered with
shadow<00:05:01.099> so<00:05:02.099> what<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.400> would<00:05:02.580> like<00:05:02.669> you<00:05:02.759> guys<00:05:02.819> to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
shadow so what I would like you guys to

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.570 
shadow so what I would like you guys to
do<00:05:03.180> now<00:05:03.389> is<00:05:03.690> just<00:05:03.800> practice<00:05:04.800> creating<00:05:05.250> not

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
do now is just practice creating not

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.899 
do now is just practice creating not
only<00:05:05.610> contour<00:05:06.479> but<00:05:06.690> cross<00:05:07.199> contour<00:05:07.909> within
