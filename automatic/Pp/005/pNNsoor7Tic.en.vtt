00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
case by the way god this was the game is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.460

sold<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:35.020> everything<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.930> started<00:02:37.930> filming

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
sold in everything but I started filming

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.650 
sold in everything but I started filming
and<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.250> thought<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.640> was<00:02:39.760> still<00:02:40.030> filming<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.810> I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
and I thought it was still filming and I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.680 
and I thought it was still filming and I
guess<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.870> missed<00:02:44.680> three<00:02:44.980> quarters<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
guess it missed three quarters of the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.690 
guess it missed three quarters of the
unboxing<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.740> kind<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.190> doing<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.550> over
