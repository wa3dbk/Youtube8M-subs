make sure that it's safe now the first

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.330 
make sure that it's safe now the first
thing<00:00:25.320> you're<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> want<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.160> take

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
thing you're going to want to do is take

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
thing you're going to want to do is take
a<00:00:26.369> look<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> fireplace<00:00:27.090> itself<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> make

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
a look at the fireplace itself and make

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.779 
a look at the fireplace itself and make
sure<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.039> there<00:00:29.189> aren't<00:00:29.340> any<00:00:29.490> obvious

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
sure that there aren't any obvious

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.630 
sure that there aren't any obvious
cracks<00:00:30.390> fractures<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.619> problems<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
cracks fractures or problems with it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
cracks fractures or problems with it
now<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> particular<00:00:33.450> fireplace<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.440> built

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
now this particular fireplace was built

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.799 
now this particular fireplace was built
about<00:00:34.860> 60<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.430> 65<00:00:35.910> years<00:00:36.210> ago<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.660> it's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
about 60 or 65 years ago so it's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
about 60 or 65 years ago so it's
probably<00:00:37.260> had<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> lot<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.770> fires<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
probably had a lot of fires in it and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
probably had a lot of fires in it and
probably<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.540> potential<00:00:39.870> problems<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
probably has some potential problems so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.200 
probably has some potential problems so
we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.670> very<00:00:41.730> closely

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we're going to want to look very closely

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
we're going to want to look very closely
around<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> firebox<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:43.559> sure<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
around the firebox and make sure that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
around the firebox and make sure that
there's<00:00:44.129> no<00:00:44.370> problems<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.510> see

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there's no problems that we can see

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
there's no problems that we can see
they're<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.170> obvious<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.489> reason

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
they're really obvious and the reason

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
they're really obvious and the reason
for<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.899> any<00:00:49.050> heat<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
for that is we don't want any heat that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.920 
for that is we don't want any heat that
would<00:00:49.800> escape<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> firebox<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.539> into

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
would escape the firebox to get out into

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.299 
would escape the firebox to get out into
the<00:00:52.050> wooden<00:00:52.350> part<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> building<00:00:53.160> where<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the wooden part of the building where it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.639 
the wooden part of the building where it
might<00:00:53.489> cause<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> problem<00:00:54.320> now<00:00:55.320> another<00:00:55.530> thing

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
might cause a problem now another thing

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.439 
might cause a problem now another thing
that's<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.250> very<00:00:56.430> important<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.239> want<00:00:57.329> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that's very very important we want to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.349 
that's very very important we want to
make<00:00:57.510> sure<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> nice<00:00:59.699> metal<00:01:00.059> grate

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
make sure we have is a nice metal grate

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
make sure we have is a nice metal grate
or<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> screen<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
or a screen like this now a lot of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
or a screen like this now a lot of
fireplaces<00:01:02.969> today<00:01:03.420> come<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> glass<00:01:04.229> front

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
fireplaces today come with a glass front

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.870 
fireplaces today come with a glass front
and<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.309> fine<00:01:05.519> thing<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and that's that's a fine thing to have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
and that's that's a fine thing to have
but<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.540> grate<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.260> screen<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
but the go grate or screen like this

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.429 
but the go grate or screen like this
it's<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:08.970> handy<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> does

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it's really handy because what it does

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
it's really handy because what it does
is<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> catches<00:01:11.400> any<00:01:11.549> sparks<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> might<00:01:12.479> fly

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
is it catches any sparks that might fly

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.840 
is it catches any sparks that might fly
out<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> fireplace<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.890> prevents<00:01:14.700> them

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
out of the fireplace and prevents them

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
out of the fireplace and prevents them
from<00:01:14.880> landing<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.600> nearby<00:01:15.930> combustible<00:01:16.740> such

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
from landing on nearby combustible such

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
from landing on nearby combustible such
as<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> carpet<00:01:17.520> or<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.119> things<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.540> might

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
as the carpet or other things that might

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
as the carpet or other things that might
be<00:01:18.930> around<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:20.009> speaking<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> combustible

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
be around and speaking of combustible

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.010 
be around and speaking of combustible
let's<00:01:21.090> take<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:21.960> here

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we've left by the fireplace

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440 
we've left by the fireplace

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
now it's handy to have obviously to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.719 
now it's handy to have obviously to
start<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> fire<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.740> case<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.189> fire<00:01:29.460> we

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
start the fire but in case of a fire we
don't<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.020> pile<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.979> newspapers

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
don't want to have a pile of newspapers

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
don't want to have a pile of newspapers
laying<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.750> could<00:01:33.930> catch<00:01:34.140> fire

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
laying right here that could catch fire

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.770 
laying right here that could catch fire
so<00:01:34.979> we're<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.369> pick<00:01:35.549> these<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.780> get

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so we're just going to pick these up get

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
so we're just going to pick these up get
them<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.009> we'll<00:01:38.100> come<00:01:38.310> back

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
them out of the way and we'll come back

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.920 
them out of the way and we'll come back
to<00:01:38.640> those<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.270> ready<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.630> build<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to those when we get ready to build a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.590 
to those when we get ready to build a
fire<00:01:40.140> later<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.610> over<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.119> here

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
fire later on now over right here

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
fire later on now over right here
let's<00:01:42.930> take<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> look<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.549> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
let's take a look at this thing now this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.249 
let's take a look at this thing now this
handle<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> actually

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
handle that you see here that actually

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.530 
handle that you see here that actually
controls<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.100> damper<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.939> fireplace

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
controls the damper on this fireplace

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840 
controls the damper on this fireplace
now<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> purpose<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> damper<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
now the purpose of the damper is to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
now the purpose of the damper is to
regulate<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> amount<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> air<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.110> flows

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
regulate the amount of air that flows

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.800 
regulate the amount of air that flows
through<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.130> chimney<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.000> lessen<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
through the chimney so you can lessen it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
through the chimney so you can lessen it
or<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.110> allow<00:01:55.259> more<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.860> through<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.000> one

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
or will allow more to go through and one

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.399 
or will allow more to go through and one
of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> problems<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> lot<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> people

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of the problems that a lot of people

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
of the problems that a lot of people
have<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.070> forget<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.430> open<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.149> damper

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
have is they forget to open the damper

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.789 
have is they forget to open the damper
when<00:02:00.719> they're<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> start<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> fire<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
when they're going to start a fire and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.980 
when they're going to start a fire and
what<00:02:02.369> happens<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> buildup<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
what happens is you get a buildup of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
what happens is you get a buildup of
smoke<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> rolls<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.729> you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
smoke in there and it rolls out and you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.240 
smoke in there and it rolls out and you
have<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> very<00:02:06.810> stinky<00:02:07.140> smelly<00:02:07.619> mess<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.129> your

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
have a very stinky smelly mess in your

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
have a very stinky smelly mess in your
house<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.300> want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> make<00:02:09.720> sure<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
house so we want to make sure that this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.510 
house so we want to make sure that this
damper<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> open<00:02:11.310> position

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
damper is in the open position

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.060 
damper is in the open position
by<00:02:13.330> pushing<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.840> handle<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.800> again

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
by pushing that handle in and again

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.980 
by pushing that handle in and again
remember<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.820> some<00:02:16.060> modern<00:02:16.420> fireplaces

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
remember that on some modern fireplaces

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.410 
remember that on some modern fireplaces
the<00:02:17.410> damper<00:02:17.800> control<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.400> typically<00:02:18.790> inside

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the damper control is typically inside

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.230 
the damper control is typically inside
the<00:02:19.660> firebox<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:21.130> above<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.550> fire<00:02:21.760> itself

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
the firebox just above the fire itself

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.730 
the firebox just above the fire itself
where<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.450> fire<00:02:22.750> will<00:02:22.960> be<00:02:23.110> itself<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.650> you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
where the fire will be itself so you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.170 
where the fire will be itself so you
want<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> make<00:02:24.040> sure<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.700> open<00:02:24.910> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
want to make sure that it is open to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.910 
want to make sure that it is open to
allow<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.420> smoke<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> get<00:02:26.050> out<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.770> let's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
allow the smoke to get out now let's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.530 
allow the smoke to get out now let's
take<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> quick<00:02:27.370> look<00:02:27.550> up<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.910> chimney<00:02:28.180> just

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
take a quick look up that chimney just

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.910 
take a quick look up that chimney just
to<00:02:28.660> make<00:02:28.810> sure<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.080> there's<00:02:29.290> nothing<00:02:29.620> there

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
to make sure that there's nothing there

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.950 
to make sure that there's nothing there
so<00:02:30.100> we'll<00:02:30.190> move<00:02:30.370> my<00:02:30.550> screen<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:33.960> take

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
so we'll move my screen here take

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.540 
so we'll move my screen here take
flashlight<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.740> get<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.340> take<00:02:36.490> a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
flashlight and get up there and take a

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.200 
flashlight and get up there and take a
look<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.240> see<00:02:37.870> as<00:02:38.020> far<00:02:38.230> as<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:40.060> make

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
look and see as far as I can see to make

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.420 
look and see as far as I can see to make
sure<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.720> clear<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.860> after<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.220> check

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
sure it is clear and so after you check

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.590 
sure it is clear and so after you check
in<00:02:42.610> there<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.850> want<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> make<00:02:43.150> sure<00:02:43.180> that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
in there you want to make sure that

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.120 
in there you want to make sure that
there's<00:02:43.840> clear<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.470> can<00:02:44.530> see<00:02:44.800> all<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
there's clear and you can see all the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.090 
there's clear and you can see all the
way<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.610> sky<00:02:46.290> often<00:02:47.290> times<00:02:47.560> at<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.890> first

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
way to the sky often times at the first

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770 
way to the sky often times at the first
fire<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> season<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.300> might<00:02:49.480> find<00:02:49.630> that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
fire of the season you might find that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.330 
fire of the season you might find that
there's<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.050> problem<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.650> chimney<00:02:51.040> it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
there's a problem in the chimney it's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.820 
there's a problem in the chimney it's
not<00:02:51.580> uncommon<00:02:52.000> for<00:02:52.210> birds<00:02:52.870> or<00:02:53.200> squirrels<00:02:53.530> to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
not uncommon for birds or squirrels to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.800 
not uncommon for birds or squirrels to
build<00:02:54.040> nest<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.520> there<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.940> cause<00:02:55.600> an

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
build nest in there and cause an

so<00:02:58.570> make<00:02:58.780> sure<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.260> clear<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.560> you

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
so make sure that it's clear that you

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.590 
so make sure that it's clear that you
can<00:02:59.980> see<00:03:00.160> all<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.460> way<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.790> sky<00:03:01.030> all<00:03:01.420> right

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
can see all the way to the sky all right

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.240 
can see all the way to the sky all right
we've<00:03:01.990> talked<00:03:02.230> about<00:03:02.380> what<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.710> look<00:03:02.800> for<00:03:03.160> in

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
we've talked about what to look for in
