 of says and if so is the material is a 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.140
 little more fragile than dc paper 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.570
 comics is the point of view but good 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.880

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.090

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.700
 written by bill willingham is a 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.090

 and well what is the story in the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.040
 history is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.420
 basically mainly because it's 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.880
 divided in three but it is the same 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.160
 the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.670
 characters that we know from the story of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.059
 fairies live problems of life 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.360
 everyday that live today in the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:15.050
 society as crimes and that then 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.300
 the story starts with with since the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.210
 that goes and tells you the big bad wolf of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.480
 'Little Red Riding Hood' that happened a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.680
 atrocious crime at the same time is 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.170
 waiting for snow white 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.970
 Snow White is the subdelegate that is 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.640
 arranging a topic that are about to 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.910

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.750
 since good wolf tells you 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.950

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.330
 You can see on this sheet in your apartment 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.360
 and the endings are if I can not 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.509
 tell 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.330
 bill willingham brings us a story 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.920
 easy to understand but difficult to 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.040
 explain how they could have been good 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.130
 as you could already notice the narrative is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.240
 quite fluid very very very fluid and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.550
 it was pretty good that he brought us 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.220
 another expectation of what the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.880
 fairytale characters if they were 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.730
 human humans the stroke of the medina is 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.860
 Preciously, she is really shocked 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.980
 with his stroke is very much in line with the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.570
 history because it's a reason that 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.030
 Remember as if you were reading 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.330

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.010

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.689
