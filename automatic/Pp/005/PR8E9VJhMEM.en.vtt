00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.789
 We will begin assembly of our steam locomotive from massive wheels. 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.900
 On the wheels set the platform. Our locomotive is steam driven, 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.580
 to get it we need a boiler and a firebox to boil water 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.379
 from the steam boiler gets into a special 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.710
 a camera that drives the wheels with a piston 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 And the exhaust steam will be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.980
 go through the tank with the pipe, install it! 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000
 And of course we need a driverâ€™s cab 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.620
 The locomotive assembly is finished, 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.630
 let's see how it works. 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.020
 We light a fire in the firebox, fill the tank with water and boil it. 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.580
 From boiling water is formed 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.210
 steam and locomotive start moving 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 Look, exhaust steam comes out of the pipe. So we collected everything right! 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.759
 Now it looks like 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.850
 real and can carry people and goods. 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.470
 But for this we need cars, we will have two of them. 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.770
 Okay, now the locomotive is ready to go 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.970
 to the nearest station, where passengers were already waiting for him 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.020
 Well, all the passengers took their seats and are ready to go on a trip. 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.980
 Come on! 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.000
 Let's see how the engine works. 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.680
 Great, I like it. 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 Bye bye, see you soon
