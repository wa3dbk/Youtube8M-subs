00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
the staff and he all he did he kept the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.590 
the staff and he all he did he kept the
same<00:06:52.730> patellar<00:06:53.180> tendon<00:06:53.660> and<00:06:54.070> he<00:06:55.270> attached<00:06:56.270> it

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
same patellar tendon and he attached it

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.360 
same patellar tendon and he attached it
to<00:06:56.900> the<00:06:57.500> metal<00:06:58.570> and<00:06:59.570> when<00:06:59.870> he<00:07:00.020> did<00:07:00.340> he<00:07:01.340> was

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
to the metal and when he did he was

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.790 
to the metal and when he did he was
hoping<00:07:01.820> it<00:07:01.970> was<00:07:02.090> stayed<00:07:02.330> but<00:07:02.800> unfortunately

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
hoping it was stayed but unfortunately

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.010 
hoping it was stayed but unfortunately
it<00:07:04.070> didn't<00:07:04.460> and<00:07:04.880> because<00:07:05.080> of<00:07:06.080> that<00:07:06.380> the<00:07:08.020> mean

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
it didn't and because of that the mean

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.710 
it didn't and because of that the mean
that's<00:07:09.620> supposed<00:07:09.920> to<00:07:10.040> be<00:07:10.100> right<00:07:10.400> here<00:07:10.720> came

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
that's supposed to be right here came

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.910 
that's supposed to be right here came
loose<00:07:12.020> and<00:07:12.440> it's<00:07:13.370> white<00:07:13.580> appear<00:07:14.000> now<00:07:14.410> so<00:07:15.410> I

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:15.920 
loose and it's white appear now so I

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.090 
loose and it's white appear now so I
have<00:07:16.760> no<00:07:17.000> kneecap<00:07:17.480> we're<00:07:18.200> supposed<00:07:18.530> to<00:07:18.620> be<00:07:18.800> and

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.100 
have no kneecap we're supposed to be and

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.860 
have no kneecap we're supposed to be and
because<00:07:19.670> I<00:07:19.820> don't<00:07:20.030> have<00:07:20.210> the<00:07:20.360> patellar<00:07:20.750> tendon

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
because I don't have the patellar tendon

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
because I don't have the patellar tendon
in<00:07:21.500> there<00:07:21.710> I<00:07:21.950> can<00:07:22.730> only<00:07:22.970> move<00:07:23.600> my<00:07:24.110> leg<00:07:24.350> out<00:07:24.620> this

far
I<00:07:25.520> can<00:07:26.120> bend<00:07:26.420> it<00:07:26.630> but<00:07:27.620> it<00:07:27.980> will<00:07:28.160> not<00:07:28.550> go<00:07:28.880> out<00:07:29.300> I

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
I can bend it but it will not go out I

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.680 
I can bend it but it will not go out I
have<00:07:29.780> to<00:07:30.320> use<00:07:30.680> this<00:07:30.950> leg<00:07:31.310> to<00:07:32.090> make<00:07:32.270> it<00:07:32.510> go<00:07:32.660> out

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
have to use this leg to make it go out

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.920

walk and I will I also have to use a

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.909 
walk and I will I also have to use a
brace<00:07:42.230> and<00:07:42.620> a<00:07:42.800> walker<00:07:43.070> whenever
