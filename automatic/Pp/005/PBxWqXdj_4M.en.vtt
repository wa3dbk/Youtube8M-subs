00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.290 

it's<00:00:36.320> always<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:37.070> two-step<00:00:38.030> process<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
it's always a two-step process so the

your<00:00:47.900> head<00:00:48.290> you<00:00:48.440> put<00:00:48.470> grease<00:00:48.830> on<00:00:49.040> your<00:00:49.100> scalp

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
your head you put grease on your scalp

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.480 
your head you put grease on your scalp
and<00:00:49.850> you're<00:00:50.630> good<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.870> go<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:51.470> water<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.280> like

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
and you're good to go and water is like

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.370 
and you're good to go and water is like
the<00:00:52.670> enemy<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.180> don't<00:00:53.510> put<00:00:53.780> water<00:00:54.080> in<00:00:54.260> your

head but it's contrary you actually
always<00:00:59.030> need<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.600> have<00:00:59.630> water<00:01:00.170> in<00:01:00.290> your<00:01:00.530> hair

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
always need to have water in your hair

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.970 
always need to have water in your hair
whether<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.190> be<00:01:01.400> in<00:01:01.640> its<00:01:02.480> purest<00:01:02.810> form<00:01:02.989> or<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.560> a

whether it be in its purest form or in a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.710 
whether it be in its purest form or in a
leave-in<00:01:04.160> conditioner<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.120> I<00:01:05.360> think<00:01:05.420> they'll

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
leave-in conditioner and I think they'll

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.510 
leave-in conditioner and I think they'll
even<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.110> conditioner<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.980> best<00:01:07.190> because

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
even the conditioner is the best because

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.580 
even the conditioner is the best because
you<00:01:07.610> get<00:01:07.760> water<00:01:07.940> as<00:01:08.180> well<00:01:08.390> as<00:01:08.540> other<00:01:08.810> nutrients

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
you get water as well as other nutrients

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.250 
you get water as well as other nutrients
the<00:01:09.920> trick<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.310> all<00:01:10.640> curly<00:01:11.090> hair<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.510> moisture

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
the trick to all curly hair is moisture

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.630 
the trick to all curly hair is moisture
condition<00:01:12.830> condition<00:01:13.010> that's<00:01:13.280> why<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.550> have

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
condition condition that's why we have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.950 
condition condition that's why we have
leave-in<00:01:13.820> conditioners<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.660> this<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.930> that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
leave-in conditioners and this and that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.040 
leave-in conditioners and this and that
obviously<00:01:15.770> we<00:01:15.920> have<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.940> sebum<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.540> comes

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
obviously we have the sebum that comes

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.660 
obviously we have the sebum that comes
out<00:01:18.200> from<00:01:18.380> our<00:01:18.530> scalp<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.190> because<00:01:19.550> our

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
out from our scalp but because our

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.420 
out from our scalp but because our
strands<00:01:20.150> are<00:01:20.270> coiled<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:21.350> doesn't<00:01:21.800> travel<00:01:22.130> to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
strands are coiled it doesn't travel to

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.890 
strands are coiled it doesn't travel to
the<00:01:22.520> ends<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.910> our<00:01:23.030> hair<00:01:23.240> which<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.600> why<00:01:23.720> we

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
the ends of our hair which is why we

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.180 
the ends of our hair which is why we
have<00:01:24.140> breakage<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.369> spins<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.530> we<00:01:27.830> want<00:01:28.040> to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
have breakage and spins so we want to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.510 
have breakage and spins so we want to
retain<00:01:28.369> moisture<00:01:31.060> moisture<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.860> single<00:01:34.280> most

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
retain moisture moisture the single most
