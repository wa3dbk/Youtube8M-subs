are<00:00:41.059> experimenting<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
are experimenting with more of the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.799 
are experimenting with more of the

Thomas maybe we can get Percy James
probably<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:49.230> good<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.620> any<00:00:49.950> others<00:00:50.489> but

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
probably not good in any others but

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
probably not good in any others but
Percy<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.690> James<00:00:51.780> maybe<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.620> add<00:00:52.770> some

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
Percy and James maybe they can add some

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520 
Percy and James maybe they can add some
sound<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.329> equal<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.780> next<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
sound and that be equal to next is a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.549 
sound and that be equal to next is a
celebration<00:00:56.270> Thomas<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.480> again<00:00:58.199> it's
