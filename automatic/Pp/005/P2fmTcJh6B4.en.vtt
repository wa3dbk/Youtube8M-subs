going to have this connection right here

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:54.129 
going to have this connection right here
you're<00:05:51.110> just<00:05:51.289> going<00:05:51.409> to<00:05:51.469> gently<00:05:51.709> pull<00:05:52.099> back<00:05:53.139> on

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
you're just going to gently pull back on

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.109 
you're just going to gently pull back on
it<00:05:54.619> kind<00:05:55.129> of<00:05:55.189> pull<00:05:55.429> like<00:05:56.289> forward<00:05:57.289> in<00:05:57.499> that<00:05:57.709> way

00:05:58.109 --> 00:05:58.119 
it kind of pull like forward in that way

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
it kind of pull like forward in that way
and<00:06:01.119> your<00:06:02.119> screen<00:06:02.539> should<00:06:04.929> come<00:06:05.929> right<00:06:06.079> out

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
and your screen should come right out

and your screen should come right out
and<00:06:08.889> want<00:06:09.889> to<00:06:09.949> lay<00:06:10.099> that<00:06:10.279> back<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:13.209> now<00:06:14.209> we've

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
and want to lay that back and now we've

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:31.929 
and want to lay that back and now we've
successfully<00:06:15.699> detach<00:06:16.699> the<00:06:16.939> screen<00:06:30.939> so

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:31.939 
successfully detach the screen so

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:47.110 
did but do it in reverse lay the screen
flat

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:07:08.330 

and<00:06:48.120> reconnect<00:06:48.720> the<00:06:48.840> jumper<00:07:07.310> numbers<00:07:08.310> a

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
and reconnect the jumper numbers a

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.270 
and reconnect the jumper numbers a
little<00:07:08.520> difficult<00:07:09.150> to<00:07:09.180> reconnect<00:07:09.780> but<00:07:10.280> just

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
little difficult to reconnect but just

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.610
