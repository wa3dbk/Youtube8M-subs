just hitch pin and this Baldwin on the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.680 
just hitch pin and this Baldwin on the
left<00:00:50.649> doesn't<00:00:51.160> so<00:00:51.760> what<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.390> hitch<00:00:52.660> pin

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
left doesn't so what is a hitch pin

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.139 
left doesn't so what is a hitch pin
anyway<00:00:53.590> well<00:00:54.160> you<00:00:54.280> know<00:00:54.399> there's<00:00:54.609> your<00:00:54.730> tuning

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
anyway well you know there's your tuning

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.619 
anyway well you know there's your tuning
pin<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:55.989> end<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.500> piano<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:57.269> on<00:00:58.269> the

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
pin on this end of the piano and on the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.389 
pin on this end of the piano and on the
other<00:00:58.750> end<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.199> piano<00:00:59.379> the<00:01:00.010> strings

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
other end of the piano the strings

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.430 
other end of the piano the strings
wraparound<00:01:00.969> hitch<00:01:01.780> pins

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
wraparound hitch pins

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.860 
wraparound hitch pins
now<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.129> most<00:01:03.340> pianos<00:01:03.879> they're<00:01:04.269> just<00:01:04.690> like

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
now on most pianos they're just like

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.900 
now on most pianos they're just like
they<00:01:05.019> are<00:01:05.050> in<00:01:05.230> this<00:01:05.680> Baldwin<00:01:06.280> there<00:01:06.790> are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
they are in this Baldwin there are

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.780 
they are in this Baldwin there are
little<00:01:07.090> hooks<00:01:07.420> as<00:01:07.660> you<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:07.930> see<00:01:08.170> here<00:01:08.560> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
little hooks as you can see here and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.400 
little hooks as you can see here and
they<00:01:09.790> wrap<00:01:09.970> around<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.390> hooks<00:01:10.660> and<00:01:10.960> you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
they wrap around the hooks and you

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.630 
they wrap around the hooks and you
notice<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.520> strings<00:01:12.910> are<00:01:13.950> over<00:01:14.950> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
notice that the strings are over the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.210 
notice that the strings are over the
bridge<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.510> they<00:01:17.410> have<00:01:17.620> a<00:01:17.650> certain<00:01:17.950> amount<00:01:18.100> of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
bridge so they have a certain amount of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.420 
bridge so they have a certain amount of
down<00:01:18.580> bearing<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.210> bridge<00:01:19.480> which<00:01:19.990> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
down bearing on the bridge which is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430 
down bearing on the bridge which is
glued<00:01:21.430> on<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.850> soundboard<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:23.170> there<00:01:23.290> has

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
glued on to the soundboard so there has

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.790 
glued on to the soundboard so there has
to<00:01:23.470> be<00:01:23.620> downward<00:01:24.190> pressure<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:26.470> when<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
to be downward pressure now so when the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.880 
to be downward pressure now so when the
piano<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.510> manufactured<00:01:28.510> or<00:01:28.660> rebuilt<00:01:29.230> the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
piano is manufactured or rebuilt the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.950 
piano is manufactured or rebuilt the
height<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.790> plate<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.240> adjusted<00:01:31.780> so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
height of the plate is adjusted so

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.330 
height of the plate is adjusted so
there's<00:01:32.170> just<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.620> right<00:01:32.830> amount<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.130> down

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
there's just the right amount of down

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460 
there's just the right amount of down
bearing<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:33.970> that's<00:01:34.510> critical<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.290> tone

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
bearing and that's critical to the tone

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.980 
bearing and that's critical to the tone
of<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.680> piano<00:01:35.950> now<00:01:36.820> take<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.150> look<00:01:37.450> at<00:01:37.690> this

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
of the piano now take a look at this

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.370 
of the piano now take a look at this
Baldwin<00:01:38.500> SD<00:01:38.890> 10<00:01:39.190> for<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.580> 1970s<00:01:40.480> and<00:01:40.750> on<00:01:41.200> this

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
Baldwin SD 10 for the 1970s and on this

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.620 
Baldwin SD 10 for the 1970s and on this
piano<00:01:41.740> instead<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.580> having<00:01:42.790> hooks<00:01:43.150> on<00:01:43.420> hitch

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
piano instead of having hooks on hitch

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.860 
piano instead of having hooks on hitch
pins<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.440> notice<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:45.340> they<00:01:45.970> are<00:01:46.240> instead

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
pins you notice that they are instead

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.450 
pins you notice that they are instead
these<00:01:47.970> vertical<00:01:48.970> rods<00:01:49.330> now<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.890> reason<00:01:51.280> why

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
these vertical rods now the reason why

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.940 
these vertical rods now the reason why
Baldwin<00:01:52.030> chose<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.540> do<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.720> is<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
Baldwin chose to do that is that the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.000 
Baldwin chose to do that is that the
strings<00:01:54.340> could<00:01:54.670> actually<00:01:54.940> be<00:01:55.890> adjusted<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
strings could actually be adjusted the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.320 
strings could actually be adjusted the
height<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.460> strings<00:01:57.730> could<00:01:57.970> be<00:01:58.030> adjusted

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
height of the strings could be adjusted

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.020 
height of the strings could be adjusted
depending<00:01:58.630> upon<00:01:59.080> how<00:01:59.890> much<00:02:00.100> down<00:02:00.370> bearing<00:02:00.880> is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
depending upon how much down bearing is

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.000 
depending upon how much down bearing is
desired<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:02.050> different<00:02:02.350> registers<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.800> the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
desired in different registers of the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.730 
desired in different registers of the
piano<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.750> down<00:02:04.960> bearing<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:05.590> be

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
piano so the down bearing can be

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.180 
piano so the down bearing can be
adjusted<00:02:06.370> precisely<00:02:07.270> even<00:02:08.200> after<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.679> piano<00:02:09.099> is

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
adjusted precisely even after a piano is

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.610 
adjusted precisely even after a piano is
rebuilt<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.170> benefits

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
rebuilt so this is one of the benefits

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.130 
rebuilt so this is one of the benefits
and<00:02:11.800> why<00:02:11.950> many<00:02:12.640> Baldwin's<00:02:13.300> with<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> Accu

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and why many Baldwin's with the Accu

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.140 
and why many Baldwin's with the Accu
adjust<00:02:14.470> hitch<00:02:14.620> pins<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> particular

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
adjust hitch pins have a particular

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.940 
adjust hitch pins have a particular
singing<00:02:16.599> tone<00:02:16.870> particularly<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.709> treble

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
singing tone particularly in the treble

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.250

because<00:02:18.760> there<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.599> not<00:02:19.750> too

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970

so<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:25.930> one<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> many<00:02:26.489> technologies<00:02:27.489> that

so that's one of many technologies that

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.119 
so that's one of many technologies that
Baldwin<00:02:28.000> has<00:02:28.420> now<00:02:29.200> does<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.620> mean<00:02:29.799> that<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
Baldwin has now does that mean that the

Baldwin has now does that mean that the
