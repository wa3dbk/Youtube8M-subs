 the team who jockey is a variant there that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.799
 It is very rare for a baby samsung but in 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.390
 It's true it's called bi dung chicken geoc 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 which is ok baby 11 june it goes 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 appear that mounted on a chicken 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.299
 then this new mobi is a zombie baby 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.299
 that will appear mounted on the chicken and the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.369
 zombie he will control the chicken is this 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.710
 sumbe baby that will be mounted on the

 chicken will not take damage in fall 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 because the chicken it when it is falling 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.079
 She starts to flap her wings and goes down. 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.420
 slowly and you're a very handsome man too. 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.759
 rare and extremely rare because then the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.729
 minimum percentage of appearance 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.100
 he will only talk when a baby is a 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.530
 baby zombie is generated and also it can 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.170
 appear in the neder then there it will be 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.259
 A baby zombie pig does not ride on the chicken 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.750
 I do not care if I care. I got one. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.409
 command block that we have to give 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.950
 the command in a chat to catch because in the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.469
 creative menu does not exist and then the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.710
 people put the team lives their nick 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.040
 that I put it in the description of the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.959
 video for you to test because it is very 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.890
 rare to appear and move is not like me 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.440
 I told you, they have a percentage 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.770
 minimum to appear and will only return 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.780
 when a baby zombie was generated right? 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.030
 I'm nothing then clicking here with 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.730
 right is the right mouse button 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.370
 The command here is very simple, right? 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.700
 We will work and install a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.480
 sound be that the rock coordinates 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.610
 this video is the height at xyz né 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.760
 to iacc then the command here is spoken if 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.489
 for a baby is not true and will 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.390
 put joaquim's command and that's what 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.670
 of the line 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.280
 this command that simple this way 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.980
 So here you go and put a 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.230
 pressure here we will press looks 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.019
 It's just falling here as you can. 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.880
 see he did not look giving the fall because 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.690
 the hen comes flapping her wings and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.049
 leave 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.230
 Look what a cute little baby. 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.959
 zombie not who is in the sun 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.090
 That's one more stop here for 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.030
 example looking at chicken at chicken a 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.980
 chicken will not take damage want to take 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.329

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.320
 Look, I just do not know how fast he is. 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.660
 here with the chicken 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.600

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.269
 0 beauty because the music stopped main 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.980
 I do not know if they're going after me. 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.680
 I did not test the first time I 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.310
 I'm testing dying. 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.120

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.480
 Look what 's faster than normal. 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.660
 do not know 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:02.820
 Look, he's jumping and flying. 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:07.480
 recalling that in the heart and mail hi 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:10.720

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.750
 to see if he will jump and cup one 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.970
 Megapoço was not going to die if I put 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.570
 here then not creative again 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.930
 so this is it here was the ubv 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.870
 bjork timken normal young né a zombie 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.670
 normal here that is very rare in the 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.940
 then replied that with the block of 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.120
 command to make it easier for you 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.050
 now let's visualize the pro neder 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.910
 command block here is a board 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.940
 expression command the staff will only change 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.420
 here is the name of the zombie that we go 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.090
 put a fix or a bomb is good it's the same 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.190
 command and only change the Pixon guinea that 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.230
 coordinates here you put which you 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.640
 You want us to put more or less 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.660
 to putting these here to be more 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.690
 fast 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.860
 it will appear that it is closer to you 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.930
 Look, it's just here. Look, we only have one. 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.940
 zombie jockey 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.160
 Look, I was born, I'm going to do it. 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.770
 creative when the dog in survival 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:26.080
 for us to see hi, it 's peaceful, it's just going 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:29.080
 to attack people hit attack because eta 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:35.940
 so he does not run after people but the 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.940
 we get close to him will give ué damage 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.760
 disclosed 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.300
 I think you're not controlling the 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.950
 Chicken looks only I think it should be 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.410
 logged is not controlling the galleon 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.280
 get close where squeezes that he will me 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.150
 kill it 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.400
 or almost it is really I believe it should 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.490
 be a bug or try to spy on 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.770
 another was bribed look only because 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.500
 that is not controlling the chicken 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.250
 unlike the normal world side that 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.530
 the baby zombie is controlling the chicken 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.290
 Yeah, and you're going to kill the shot, let me kill you. 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.680
 said he did not take it and he kills because he's 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.310
 looking at me show and go-go matatu is 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.800
 really look only here the attack 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.750
 of them are individual and individual 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.540
 because there in neder these people beating a 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:29.320
 pizon bounces the pinkman zombie everybody 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:32.590
 run after us, do not you baby the sound of 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.370
 Pygmy was just a né I hit only him 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.850
 even though he 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.820
 kill me let's talk here last 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.490
 Look at this one, he controls the chicken. 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.889
 side is not controlling, let's see 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.050
 maybe it's a bug, maybe if they 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.270
 They will still fix this, I do not know. 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.830
 Look what this is running after me. 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.180
 personal beauty this video is getting 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.370

 the one he favors to help in the 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.400
 channel and disclosure and was not 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:05.760
 inscribed on the scene until the next 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.760
