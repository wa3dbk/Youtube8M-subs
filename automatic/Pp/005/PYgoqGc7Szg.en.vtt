could kind of see on the inside there's

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
could kind of see on the inside there's
really<00:00:44.460> nothing<00:00:44.940> um<00:00:46.640> yeah<00:00:47.640> okay<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.890> here

really nothing um yeah okay so over here

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.170 
really nothing um yeah okay so over here
is<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> front<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.539> big<00:00:55.640> handle<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
is the front you have a big handle it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
is the front you have a big handle it
door<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.539> open<00:00:58.820> simple<00:01:00.140> they<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.590> seats

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
door to open simple they will be seats

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.390 
door to open simple they will be seats
here<00:01:03.110> they'll<00:01:04.110> either<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> seat<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> sign

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
here they'll either be a seat or a sign

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
here they'll either be a seat or a sign
I'm<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.909> sure<00:01:05.970> yet<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.500> around

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I'm not sure yet then you go around

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.760 
I'm not sure yet then you go around
there's<00:01:08.250> nothing<00:01:08.790> probably<00:01:09.720> put<00:01:10.140> signs<00:01:10.439> again

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there's nothing probably put signs again

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.969 
there's nothing probably put signs again
back<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.610> um<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:15.270> architectural

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
back here um just an architectural

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.230 
back here um just an architectural
detail<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> probably<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
detail here this is probably going to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.310 
detail here this is probably going to
move<00:01:18.560> once<00:01:19.560> again<00:01:19.799> I'll<00:01:19.890> probably<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.369> more

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
move once again I'll probably put more

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
move once again I'll probably put more
advertising<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.689> try<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:26.360> put

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
advertising here or I will try to put

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.679 
advertising here or I will try to put
something<00:01:27.570> else<00:01:27.869> there<00:01:28.590> may<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.369> another

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
something else there may be like another

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
something else there may be like another
little<00:01:30.689> add-on<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.950> building<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.750> then

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
little add-on to the building and then

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.890 
little add-on to the building and then
here<00:01:34.490> at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> top<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.740> UM<00:01:38.900> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
here at the top is where the UM this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
here at the top is where the UM this
sign<00:01:40.110> would<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> main<00:01:40.979> sign<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.670> main

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
sign would go the main sign for main

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.690 
sign would go the main sign for main
advertising<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.979> topped<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
advertising and I have that topped and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.800 
advertising and I have that topped and
this<00:01:45.090> voided<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:47.000> that's<00:01:48.000> pretty<00:01:48.659> much

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this voided here and that's pretty much

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.069 
this voided here and that's pretty much
it<00:01:49.369> i<00:01:50.369> will<00:01:50.939> show<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> inside<00:01:51.570> right<00:01:52.049> now

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it i will show you the inside right now

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
it i will show you the inside right now
though<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:55.700> building<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> actually<00:01:56.969> two

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
though so the building is actually two

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.959 
though so the building is actually two
separate<00:01:57.780> pieces<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> splits<00:01:59.759> right

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
separate pieces you see it splits right

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.289 
separate pieces you see it splits right
there<00:02:00.469> but<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.740> still<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.189> sturdy<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.149> i'm

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
there but it is still very sturdy so i'm

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.050 
there but it is still very sturdy so i'm
just<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.780> open<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> i'll

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
just going to open it up here so i'll

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.530 
just going to open it up here so i'll
use<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.979> where<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> opens<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:10.700> to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
use it here this is where it opens up to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.349 
use it here this is where it opens up to
um<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.159> is<00:02:17.310> probably<00:02:17.549> where<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.909> counter

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
um so this is probably where the counter

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.319 
um so this is probably where the counter
would<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.469> you<00:02:19.590> could<00:02:19.769> open<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.159> up<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.459> use

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
would go so you could open it up and use

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.610 
would go so you could open it up and use
your<00:02:21.359> minifigs<00:02:22.079> there<00:02:22.469> they're<00:02:23.250> probably<00:02:23.549> be

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
your minifigs there they're probably be

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.050 
your minifigs there they're probably be
a<00:02:25.620> couple<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.579> seats<00:02:27.739> within<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.489> hallway

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
a couple of seats within this hallway

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.670 
a couple of seats within this hallway
here<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:32.150> again<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.409> were<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.799> look<00:02:35.099> at<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
here and again if you were to look at it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.319 
here and again if you were to look at it
this<00:02:37.680> way<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.549> be<00:02:38.689> bar<00:02:39.689> stools<00:02:41.329> so

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
this way there would be bar stools so

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.720 
this way there would be bar stools so
there<00:02:43.319> are<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.500> couple<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.219> different<00:02:44.609> ideas

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
there are a couple of different ideas

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.830 
there are a couple of different ideas
that<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:46.019> for<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.250> coffee<00:02:47.730> shop<00:02:47.879> once

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that I have for the coffee shop once

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.319 
that I have for the coffee shop once
again<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.079> do<00:02:49.230> not<00:02:49.439> know<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.920> chain<00:02:50.700> I'm<00:02:51.030> going

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
again I do not know the chain I'm going

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.970 
again I do not know the chain I'm going
to<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.409> probably<00:02:54.290> pop<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.590> not<00:02:55.799> gonna
