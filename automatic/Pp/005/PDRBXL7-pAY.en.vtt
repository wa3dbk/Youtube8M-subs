00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello youtube and welcome to 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.779
 next video between the google nexus 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.340
 10 and in google nexus 7 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.500
 we already had the outer one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 display now we come to the inner 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 values ​​and we have a tegra here 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.510
 3 processor and 1 gigabyte ram 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 Here we have such a quad core a5 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.029
 dual-core graphics unit and 2 gigabytes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.189
 R.A.M 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.590
 This was totally technic but notice 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.900
 I know what I say 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.119
 there are actually for 95 anyway 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 percent of the power goes ahead and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.460
 rear double and triple 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.730
 then maybe there are a few 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.559
 video programs or of course the games 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.239
 but draw their benefit from it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 just because the manufacturers are watching 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 that as many devices as possible compatible 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 I do not have to think so 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.079
 great thoughts on it of course 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.340
 there are already games that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.930
 different on different 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 Android devices look like they do more 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 exploit power but then for it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.180
 look 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.890
 in my opinion , those are the ones 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.969
 have the rhein- computing power values 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 actually only about it 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 to do benchmarks to see then 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 can see the thing has 5,000 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.850
 points more than what do you want with 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.280
 but he teaches in daily life 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 if I surf the page does not load 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.140
 faster 1 gb 32 gb ram are natural 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.150
 nice if I change between apps 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.720
 enough stuff to be cached there 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.210
 can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.060
 but with the incorporated I come 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.600
 great I do not have any lex here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.450
 ruckler 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 that has android as well as 4.1.1 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 finally getting this micro clear 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.170
 when switching and our lockscreen 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.689
 change well there is now 4.2 but do not care 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 the software is there because nothing jerks 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.090
 more so the inner performance needs 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.689
 I do not back camera out other 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.229
 theme if I with the 1.9 camera better 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.430
 videochat do as with the 12 I can 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 somehow I see you and the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.869
 difference what I see but is that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 I here a umts so a 3g version 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.579
 available for 300 euros 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 where i go with skype 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.820
 make my google hangout on the go 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 and here I am always on the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.549
 wlan or hotspot instructed 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.259
 Of course there is one 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.340
 Nice point here that it is at all 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.340
 3g version gives 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.280
 at the size of the display whether I twitter 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.570
 now measure ten message see or 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.060
 on the thing stops only 7 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.910
 that's not the difference that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.150
 makes me use in everyday not so 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 the difference from the rhine well the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.690
 are now so by default that me 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.230
 one two three four five six seven 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.740
 eight or nine in here and against against 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.110
 the seven or 79 on the nexus 7 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.489
 You can adjust everything there is 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.810
 enough coal widgets and twitter where 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.790
 I can then change the size more 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.400
 lines more pure more epson a row 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.860
 the and size change the widgets and and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.120
 and and and anyone can adjust that 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 we wildly I need that we 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.530
 For that I need the bigger display 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.190
 not but yes it is sharper of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.590
 the colors 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.020
 many report of washed-out 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.330
 Colors or something I do not think at all 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.989
 from the mirror you can see the mirrors 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.709
 more or less both must be right there 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.950
 I do not tell you about the app offer 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.540
 it also runs both as a tablet the apps 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.340
 that run on it also run there and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.739
 vice versa, of course, there is one 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.690
 few special nexus 10 emulators the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.820
 then cool things with the big display 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.440
 make but probably meets 99 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.110
 percent of people not at all 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.260
 what it is in normal use 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.760
 means to mail means surfing means social 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.500
 media make things is called 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.910
 read again 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.260
 Edit or edit Wunderlist 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.060
 a bit of advertising but I'm just from 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.250
 Wunderlist very pleased because it is so cool 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.079
 on android finally looks like one 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.880
 app android app which really nice 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.170
 Designed is where you feel you have 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.220
 is actually always on an apple 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.120
 device at home 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.570
 Well you know what I mean what I wanted 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.040
 I announce then also otherwise 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.579
 exactly what should you buy if I am 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.560
 it again 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.000
 Both devices are now back 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.640
 available or within 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.630
 available in a few days I have here 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.680
 the 400 euros 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.239
 and I have here the 200 euro 300 euro 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.580
 if I only and only want hotspot and 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.630
 I say nexus 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.669
 no difference from the performance 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.740
 of course that 's cool but I have 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.050
 just in a video already said he will 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.120
 Holding up vertically is a horror so 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.810
 nobody gets too big for that 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.310
 work it is just too big 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.960
 horizonte herbic place without end though 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.300
 I hold her the restriction 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.520
 it does not stop him so read normally 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.380
 as with the book serverraum scroll and 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.090
 when I have a video or something 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.950
 then of course in the horizontal mode 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.430
 and then I look here and am happy 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.710
 a biscuit that 's it's the connections 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.740
 I already had differences in the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.220
 other video hinted at daily 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.870
 use of the benefit 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.639
 I would say I am 80 if I am 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.620
 Android-tablets then use it always 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.770
 maybe 80 more by now or 90 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.550
 percent of the time where I where I nexus 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.320
 7 use 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.310
 and if I am so if I am 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.110
 I would have to decide for one 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.150
 definitely the nexus 7 not the next one 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.800
 scene the nexus 10 showed what 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.200
 technically possible is on the display 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.229
 even with the comparatively low 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.320
 weight to apple ipads but that was 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.320
 here for me rather a design studio 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.350
 this is partly true gamma 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.900
 great price and I get everything with what 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.150
 actually 99 percent of the people of the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.970
 be satisfied mankind is I have 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.590
 a umts version I do not depend on here 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.789
 what I missed with both of course the 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.590
 accessories cases cover tablet keyboard 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.889
 case or something like that all the gimmicks 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.940
 this gives for for apple device for ipads 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.669
 but I also understand the manufacturer 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.260
 which can be said so the big ones 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.580
 quantities then we would have for 15 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.870
 devices and not just for a device 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.380
 It's not worth it 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.889
 really 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.180
 I see that there will be 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.680
 probably google also never shared 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.020
 specify form factor 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.160
 just as little as she really likes her 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.060
 all force 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.680
 the unified android pure too 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.210
 Every manufacturer is allowed to produce it 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.820
 also has its own healthy yet 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.770
 clap over it 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.780
 So that was it so close to that 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.260
 the whole I am often asked which 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.810
 from that 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.099
 I would say 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.560
 the time where he has a bigger display 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.810
 wishes that is not that much of course 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.129
 if I write a lot or something but then 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.150
 I think even as I write the 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.000
 then on it guts darm one 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.190
 Bluetooth keyboard extra with order 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.870
 with each other and then I have two 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.729
 different things you notice when I am 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.220
 then work really productively with it 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.870
 then I still want to be the fencer 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.580
 the laptop worries that was again 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.259
 totally confused the video i hope i will 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.639
 could do something to anyone 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.110
 maybe tell somehow something 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.000
 Helpful otherwise it writes in 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.870
 the comments 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.909
 and then I try somehow 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.479
 so answer well and up 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.479
 to the next video
