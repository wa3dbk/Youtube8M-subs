00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello and welcome to the tv 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.970
 super well has been selling for some time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.980
 rain and coconut either 1000 pieces 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.950
 interest 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 for the garden in compost or equal in the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.189
 train to breed your own little one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 More about the rules are from us 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 cleaned is harvested it is only the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.470
 cocos have and then become one 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.240
 special machine also counted that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.230
 really always 1000 pieces in one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.230
 liquid are available 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.190
 the cocos who in us then with earth 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.600
 offset so that there is something substrate 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 and so delivered 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 Now I want to show you how to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.710
 to cultivate the corset of the worms 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 correct 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.550
 in the set itself are the 1000 course 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.360
 included a wanted earth three-liter 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:15.450
 feed that every week and the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 corresponding also which was with 1 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.810
 given 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.990
 nico kraus is mixed in the earth 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.740
 or they cocos evenly in the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740
 earth are included 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.500
 which we will describe some of our 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.630
 special food about a good 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.179
 distribute tablespoon evenly and put in 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.729
 the earth reaches the surface 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.780
 meddling in the whole earth 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.679
 but just a little bit into the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.060
 surface 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.789
 the whole thing will be nice 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.710
 damp made sure to pay attention 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:08.990
 the earth is nice and wet is not wet 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.990
 but not too dry 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.860
 there comes the lid on it and the whole 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.010
 is about to stand at room temperature 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.470
 the warmer you are, the more you eat 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.770
 and the handset or the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.330
 coupons important is the whole once per 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.980
 at least for that now good 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.000
 the company is eaten away 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.770
 have developed 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.520
 Quiet twice a week or too 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.740
 three times a week what now from this 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.490
 course and we develop it 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.750
 the little ones 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.750
 show that now 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.790
 so are now three weeks around and 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.690
 Let's have a look 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.690
 are already some 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.299
 certainly not all hatched 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.760
 but you can already clearly see that 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.200
 I have developed some here and 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.200
 if we now put on the scales 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.780
 we are the 0 0 3 gram for one 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:54.849
 trees after three weeks 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:54.849
 that's already good on it 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.129
 Put the lid on it and then 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.549
 Look how the whole thing continues 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.549
 developed 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.150
 the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.830
 so we are now in the seventh week 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.020
 and look how the over my 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.440
 you can already see ticket 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.740
 corresponding sizes are already there 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.740
 Let's lie down 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:19.240
 25 16 grams 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.959
 0 26 depending on the stage of development 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.699
 the worms of course different 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:31.769
 Surely they are still some 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.659
 much smaller but you can 

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:36.989
 clearly see it are also right 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:40.499
 big is important again and again 

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:43.860
 feed because he is more calm several times 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:46.559
 feed and here, perhaps now 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.709
 announced who the relatively humid because of it 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.669
 does not matter anymore and the 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.619
 earth is also right 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.289
 that means that could be here 

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:58.999
 you also change the earth then 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.999
 Let's do another push too 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.129
 We now have our company twelve 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.770
 weeks that is three months in the same 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.180
 once left in the same earth and 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.340
 look at the result now 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.039
 here we can see the earth 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.800
 completely eaten through 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.389
 the worms are still good 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.349
 developed as were once a week 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.250
 fed but hardly increase 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:31.550
 that is, the worms now have one 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:38.219
 weight of about 0.2 to 0.3 grams 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:41.879
 if we look at it 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:46.620
 look at this vision and take it now 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:48.030
 a large tree, there is still 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.110
 take a while until you get that 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.050
 have reached size 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.539
 important here is twice a week 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.370
 feed and in time also the earth 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.319
 change when the earth is used up 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.940
 do not let burn as long as me 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:03.240
 this made in my test once 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.779
 one sees the company next to none 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.340
 damage 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:08.039
 but they do not develop it anymore 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.279
 still brings something again 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.279
 feed 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:27.150
 the earth is no longer there since the changed 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:29.550
 will have the food you have seen now 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.210
 how easy it is on the cocos 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.400
 own small country pull up to the company 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.670
 however, a certain amount of time is needed 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.960
 time you have seen that too 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:43.290
 if you have the coupons for the garden 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.240
 you can use the cocos 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.350
 either directly onto the compost 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.030
 also sprinkle a bit or on 

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.880
 different exhibit in the garden 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.040
 bring it best to ten centimeters 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.190
 under the ground in different places 

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.220
 We wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.920
 breed of your own company important 

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.570
 information about the breed you will find 

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.450
 also in our flyer or on our 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:12.770
 website www saurum de many thanks 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.770
 Until next time
