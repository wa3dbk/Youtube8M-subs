have<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> repeat<00:02:19.959> no<00:02:20.890> ticks<00:02:21.159> aren't<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.700> one

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
have a repeat no ticks aren't this one

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.430 
have a repeat no ticks aren't this one
of<00:02:22.000> another<00:02:22.180> repeater<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.170> wanna<00:02:23.290> grab

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
of another repeater you just wanna grab

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.449 
of another repeater you just wanna grab
a<00:02:23.530> torch<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.280> place<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.420> right<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.920> now

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
a torch and place it right here so now

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.819 
a torch and place it right here so now
this<00:02:28.879> is<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.200> basically<00:02:30.590> right<00:02:30.769> here

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
this is like the so basically right here

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.059 
this is like the so basically right here
you<00:02:31.579> will<00:02:31.700> have<00:02:31.849> like<00:02:32.060> your<00:02:32.769> your<00:02:33.769> door

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
you will have like your your door

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.890 
you will have like your your door
whatever<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.670> want<00:02:34.879> so<00:02:35.180> that's<00:02:35.359> your<00:02:35.510> output

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
whatever you want so that's your output

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.990 
whatever you want so that's your output
and<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.560> will<00:02:36.739> if<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.159> signal<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.730> too

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and this will if the signal is too

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.869 
and this will if the signal is too
strong<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.140> locked<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.829> if<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.519> not<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
strong it's locked and if it's not the

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.259 
strong it's locked and if it's not the
right<00:02:41.060> exact<00:02:41.480> one<00:02:42.159> it<00:02:43.159> won't<00:02:43.579> work<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.120> we

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
right exact one it won't work but we

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.899 
right exact one it won't work but we
need<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.480> add<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.989> like<00:02:45.290> check<00:02:46.280> check-in

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
need to add the like check check-in

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.699 
need to add the like check check-in
mechanism<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:47.900> checks<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.349> see<00:02:48.409> if<00:02:48.560> it's

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
mechanism so it checks to see if it's

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.800 
mechanism so it checks to see if it's
the<00:02:48.769> right<00:02:48.889> signal<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.909> do<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.180> you're

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the right signal and to do that you're

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.280 
the right signal and to do that you're
gonna<00:02:50.930> want<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.260> look<00:02:51.769> at<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.549> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
gonna want to look at the the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.000 
gonna want to look at the the
description<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.439> there's<00:02:54.560> going<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.709> be<00:02:54.769> if

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
description and there's going to be if

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.500 
description and there's going to be if
you<00:02:55.129> see<00:02:55.310> you're<00:02:55.639> gonna<00:02:55.730> look<00:02:55.909> for<00:02:56.060> your<00:02:56.150> music

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
you see you're gonna look for your music

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.559 
you see you're gonna look for your music
disc<00:02:56.719> and<00:02:57.349> there's<00:02:58.250> gonna<00:02:58.400> be<00:02:58.639> a<00:02:58.879> number<00:02:59.450> of

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
disc and there's gonna be a number of

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.360 
disc and there's gonna be a number of
how<00:02:59.780> many<00:02:59.810> redstone<00:03:00.470> dust<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.889> need<00:03:01.040> going

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
how many redstone dust you need going

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.750 
how many redstone dust you need going
into<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.700> side<00:03:01.909> of<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.090> comparator<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:04.220> for

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
into the side of this comparator so for

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.020 
into the side of this comparator so for
this<00:03:04.879> one<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.389> is<00:03:05.419> 10<00:03:06.349> I<00:03:06.620> believe<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.700> basically

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
this one it is 10 I believe so basically

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.399 
this one it is 10 I believe so basically
you're<00:03:08.480> gonna<00:03:08.569> want<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.900> put<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.260> in

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
you're gonna want to put this in

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.319 
you're gonna want to put this in
subtract<00:03:09.859> mode<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:10.819> I<00:03:10.879> look<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
subtract mode and now I look in the

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.759 
subtract mode and now I look in the
description<00:03:11.419> oh<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.290> one

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
description oh this one

really no other way to do it you have to
just<00:03:25.189> find<00:03:25.909> a<00:03:26.090> room<00:03:26.329> for<00:03:26.359> it<00:03:26.919> so<00:03:27.919> what<00:03:28.189> I'll<00:03:28.310> do

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
just find a room for it so what I'll do

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.800 
just find a room for it so what I'll do
is<00:03:28.609> I'll<00:03:28.730> just<00:03:28.760> go<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.450> know<00:03:29.569> find<00:03:30.469> uh<00:03:31.810> just

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
is I'll just go you know find uh just

is I'll just go you know find uh just
you<00:03:32.959> know<00:03:33.079> make<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.319> path<00:03:33.620> down<00:03:33.859> somewhere<00:03:34.220> so

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
you know make a path down somewhere so

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.569 
you know make a path down somewhere so
that's<00:03:34.609> 3<00:03:35.079> 4<00:03:36.079> 5<00:03:36.530> 6<00:03:37.069> 7<00:03:37.430> 8<00:03:37.909> 9<00:03:38.269> 10<00:03:38.949> so<00:03:39.949> I'll<00:03:40.220> just<00:03:40.400> go

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
that's 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so I'll just go

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.659 
that's 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so I'll just go
10<00:03:40.879> just<00:03:41.090> like<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.599> and<00:03:42.129> then<00:03:43.129> I<00:03:43.159> will<00:03:43.459> just

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
10 just like that and then I will just

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.689 
10 just like that and then I will just
place<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.269> lever<00:03:45.260> or<00:03:45.379> torch<00:03:45.949> whatever<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.519> want

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
place a lever or torch whatever you want

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.679 
place a lever or torch whatever you want
on<00:03:46.909> the<00:03:47.090> tenth<00:03:47.329> one<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:49.129> now<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:50.629> is

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
on the tenth one so now that this is

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.300 
on the tenth one so now that this is
powered<00:03:51.260> if<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:52.250> put<00:03:52.489> anything<00:03:52.699> lower<00:03:53.269> than

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
powered if I put anything lower than

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.679 
powered if I put anything lower than
this<00:03:55.310> disk<00:03:55.669> the<00:03:56.000> signal<00:03:56.299> won't<00:03:56.419> get<00:03:56.540> through

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
this disk the signal won't get through

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.939 
this disk the signal won't get through
at<00:03:56.810> all<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.079> if<00:03:57.139> I<00:03:57.199> put<00:03:57.349> something<00:03:57.470> higher<00:03:57.739> it

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
at all and if I put something higher it

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.679 
at all and if I put something higher it
will<00:03:58.040> go<00:03:58.159> through<00:03:58.340> too<00:03:58.519> much<00:03:58.669> but<00:03:59.239> if<00:03:59.329> I<00:03:59.419> put

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
will go through too much but if I put

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.009 
will go through too much but if I put
this<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:01.250> will<00:04:01.489> open<00:04:01.970> up<00:04:02.239> my<00:04:02.389> secret<00:04:02.810> door

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
this in it will open up my secret door

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.080 
this in it will open up my secret door
and<00:04:03.290> if<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.769> take<00:04:03.919> it<00:04:03.979> out<00:04:04.189> it<00:04:04.370> locks<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:04.819> if<00:04:04.939> I

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
and if I take it out it locks it if I

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.920 
and if I take it out it locks it if I
put<00:04:05.299> in<00:04:05.449> this<00:04:05.870> disk<00:04:06.169> it<00:04:06.859> locks<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> repeater

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
put in this disk it locks the repeater

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.110 
put in this disk it locks the repeater
so<00:04:09.639> nothing<00:04:10.639> happens

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
so nothing happens

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.129 
so nothing happens
that's<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.389> cool<00:04:11.509> thing<00:04:11.540> about<00:04:11.750> repeated

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
that's the cool thing about repeated

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:12.969 
that's the cool thing about repeated
locks<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.409> know<00:04:12.500> they're<00:04:12.620> not<00:04:12.739> used<00:04:12.919> that

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
locks you know they're not used that

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.539 
locks you know they're not used that
much<00:04:13.099> but<00:04:14.500> yeah<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.859> like<00:04:16.009> that<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.430> if<00:04:16.489> I

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
much but yeah just like that and if I

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.939 
much but yeah just like that and if I
put<00:04:16.729> in<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:16.909> one<00:04:17.409> you<00:04:18.409> have<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.650> exact<00:04:18.889> the

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
put in this one you have the exact the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.349 
put in this one you have the exact the
same<00:04:19.159> thing<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.400> if<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.639> put<00:04:19.820> in<00:04:19.909> a<00:04:20.000> disc<00:04:20.269> that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
same thing and if I put in a disc that

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.810 
same thing and if I put in a disc that
is<00:04:20.570> too<00:04:20.840> weak<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:22.789> just<00:04:24.310> no<00:04:25.310> rest<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.669> gets

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
is too weak it just no rest on gets

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760 
is too weak it just no rest on gets
activated<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.449> this<00:04:26.720> whole<00:04:26.930> second<00:04:27.349> part<00:04:27.380> you

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
activated in this whole second part you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.480 
activated in this whole second part you
do<00:04:28.250> not<00:04:28.370> need<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.669> add<00:04:28.820> if<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.599> are<00:04:30.400> just<00:04:31.400> doing

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
do not need to add if you are just doing

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.180 
do not need to add if you are just doing
the<00:04:31.699> first<00:04:31.880> disc<00:04:32.300> because<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.590> first<00:04:33.830> disc

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
the first disc because the first disc

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.249 
the first disc because the first disc
only<00:04:34.610> goes<00:04:34.789> one<00:04:34.820> signal<00:04:35.419> strength<00:04:35.750> so

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
only goes one signal strength so

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.860 
only goes one signal strength so
anything<00:04:37.070> higher<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.669> this<00:04:38.300> higher<00:04:38.630> will

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
anything higher and this higher will

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.490 
anything higher and this higher will
automatically<00:04:39.349> shut<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.620> off<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.760> guys

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
automatically shut it off so guys

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
counting and how the numbers work so I'm

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.830 
counting and how the numbers work so I'm
just<00:04:58.060> gonna<00:04:58.150> write<00:04:58.390> them<00:04:58.540> in<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.660> description

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.350 
anyway so you just take the signal to
