mod and one's a corner bod pic on a lot

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.500 
mod and one's a corner bod pic on a lot
is<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.179> v<00:00:15.360> q<00:00:15.630> 5<00:00:15.870> mod<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:17.119> enough<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
is just the v q 5 mod if enough that is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.890 
is just the v q 5 mod if enough that is
if<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:18.990> Alex<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.789> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> edge<00:00:21.150> mod<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.720> did

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
if not Alex on it in the edge mod I did

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840 
if not Alex on it in the edge mod I did
not<00:00:22.050> make<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.470> something<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:22.980> YouTube<00:00:23.220> already

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
not make up something on YouTube already

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.980 
not make up something on YouTube already
has<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.890> does<00:00:26.220> really<00:00:26.699> help<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.720> I'll

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
has it but it does really help so I'll

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
has it but it does really help so I'll
say<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.320> anyway<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:30.029> credit

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
say it anyway but I don't have credit

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.880 
say it anyway but I don't have credit
for<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.669> just<00:00:32.669> take<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.329> your

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
for that so just take out your

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.209 
for that so just take out your
disassemble<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.300> row<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:37.850> pieces<00:00:40.100> just<00:00:41.100> like

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
disassemble a row of pieces just like

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
disassemble a row of pieces just like
that<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.239> too<00:00:42.420> hard<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.559> will

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that don't get too hard for this will

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
that don't get too hard for this will
all<00:00:44.040> come<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:48.410> these

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
all come out and so there we go so these

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
all come out and so there we go so these
corners<00:00:50.270> v-cube<00:00:51.270> 5<00:00:51.510> mod<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.140> basically<00:00:53.600> there

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
corners v-cube 5 mod is basically there

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.209 
corners v-cube 5 mod is basically there
should<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.620> bump<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:57.469> these<00:00:58.469> corners

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
should be a little bump on these corners

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.569 
should be a little bump on these corners
right<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.550> just

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
right here so what you do is you just

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.880 
right here so what you do is you just
get<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.390> sandpaper<00:01:04.519> this<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:07.470> sand

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
get a little sandpaper this and you sand

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
get a little sandpaper this and you sand
it<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.040> until<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.119> pretty<00:01:09.479> sick<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> um<00:01:12.869> no

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it down until it's pretty sick so um no

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.580 
it down until it's pretty sick so um no
one<00:01:13.680> else<00:01:13.860> made<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:15.259> for<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> shang

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
one else made this up or for the shang

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.630 
one else made this up or for the shang
xiao<00:01:16.830> anyway<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.439> once<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.590> did<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.189> was

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
xiao anyway but once I did that it was

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
xiao anyway but once I did that it was
about<00:01:22.280> 25<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.479> tricky<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.479> really

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
about 25 this is tricky so it's really

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.289 
about 25 this is tricky so it's really
good<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.189> pretty<00:01:29.460> easy<00:01:29.729> since<00:01:30.060> there's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
good and it's pretty easy since there's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.109 
good and it's pretty easy since there's
only<00:01:30.450> eight<00:01:30.900> corners<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
only eight corners and you don't have to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.590 
only eight corners and you don't have to
disassemble<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:34.049> whole<00:01:34.770> lot<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.299> did

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
disassemble a whole lot I'm like you did

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.069 
disassemble a whole lot I'm like you did
in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> v-cube<00:01:37.950> five<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> I'll<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.780> put

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
in the v-cube five so I'll just put

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.330 
in the v-cube five so I'll just put
these<00:01:40.200> corners<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:46.189> for<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
these corners back in so and for the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
these corners back in so and for the
edges<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.020> did<00:01:49.290> not

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
edges this is the one that I did not

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.630 
edges this is the one that I did not
make<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:54.049> you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
make up so what you do is you just you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
make up so what you do is you just you
stand<00:01:56.640> down<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.780> edges<00:01:58.320> right<00:01:58.500> here

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
stand down these little edges right here

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:11.270 
stand down these little edges right here
unless<00:01:59.850> sat<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.390> side<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:03.439> like<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.660 

don't<00:02:12.280> eat<00:02:12.430> too<00:02:12.459> much<00:02:13.000> but<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:15.040> than<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.400> just

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
don't eat too much but more than I just

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.030 
don't eat too much but more than I just
OD<00:02:16.060> right<00:02:16.239> there<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:16.840> don't<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.620> too<00:02:17.709> much

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
OD right there but don't do it too much

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.420 
OD right there but don't do it too much
just<00:02:18.489> round<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.709> should<00:02:21.629> make<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
just round it and it should make it a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.650 
just round it and it should make it a
quickie<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.849> was<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> short<00:02:28.299> video

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
quickie so I know it was a short video

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.050 
quickie so I know it was a short video
but<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.069> all<00:02:30.430> how<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:32.049> do<00:02:32.379> this<00:02:33.060> so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
but that's really all how to do this so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.650 
but that's really all how to do this so
um<00:02:35.819> thanks<00:02:36.819> for<00:02:36.970> watching<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:38.560> it
