like to focus on is a different theory

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.690 
like to focus on is a different theory
and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.170> based<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.650> the<00:00:49.800> idea<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and this is based on the idea that a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.030 
and this is based on the idea that a
muscle<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.540> is<00:00:51.690> already<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.559> shortened

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
will place the muscles at a higher

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.130 
will place the muscles at a higher

muscle<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> stretch<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.049> I'm<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
muscle now the stretch that I'm going to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.250 
muscle now the stretch that I'm going to
show<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.019> stretch

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
show you is a way that you can stretch

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
show you is a way that you can stretch
your<00:02:40.290> calf<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.920> multiple<00:02:41.519> planes<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:42.030> motion

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
your calf in multiple planes of motion

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.740 
your calf in multiple planes of motion
it's<00:02:42.870> important<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> realize<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.890> muscles

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's important to realize that muscles

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.870 
it's important to realize that muscles
muscle<00:02:45.750> fibers<00:02:46.260> run<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.250> various<00:02:47.700> different

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
muscle fibers run in various different

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.699 
muscle fibers run in various different
directions<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.840> I'm<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.140> show<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.319> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
directions so I'm going to show you a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.770 
directions so I'm going to show you a
way<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.760> stretch<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.000> calf<00:02:51.360> in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
way you can stretch your calf in

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.500 
way you can stretch your calf in
multiple<00:02:52.440> planes<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.400> motion<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.239> comes

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
multiple planes of motion when it comes

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.630 
multiple planes of motion when it comes
to<00:02:54.720> muscles<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.349> important<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.069> know<00:02:56.310> that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
to muscles it's important to know that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.930 
to muscles it's important to know that
the<00:02:57.360> fibers<00:02:57.930> don't<00:02:58.230> run<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.739> one<00:02:59.040> plane<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.819> in

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the fibers don't run in one plane so in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.940 
the fibers don't run in one plane so in
other<00:03:00.030> words<00:03:00.269> they<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:00.599> simply<00:03:01.170> run<00:03:01.410> up<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
other words they don't simply run up and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.680 
other words they don't simply run up and
down

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
down

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.980 
down
side<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.800> side<00:03:03.830> they<00:03:04.820> are<00:03:04.850> intertwined<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
side to side they are intertwined and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.080 
side to side they are intertwined and
running<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:06.920> various<00:03:07.280> different<00:03:07.640> directions

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
running in various different directions

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.930 
running in various different directions
so<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:09.200> stretch<00:03:09.560> will<00:03:09.830> allow<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.700> to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
so this stretch will allow you to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.790 
so this stretch will allow you to

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
stretch the calf in those various

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.150 
stretch the calf in those various
different<00:03:13.190> directions

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:47.380
