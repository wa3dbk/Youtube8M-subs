00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
line then there's going to be on line

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.109 
line then there's going to be on line
towers<00:00:23.720> -<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.099> to<00:00:25.220> start<00:00:25.489> out<00:00:25.640> I'm<00:00:25.789> gonna<00:00:25.880> go

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
towers - so to start out I'm gonna go

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.389 
towers - so to start out I'm gonna go
over<00:00:26.419> the<00:00:26.630> off<00:00:26.869> line<00:00:27.140> towers<00:00:27.380> which<00:00:27.949> are<00:00:28.099> kind

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
over the off line towers which are kind

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.929 
over the off line towers which are kind
of<00:00:28.779> gonna<00:00:29.779> be<00:00:30.019> asynchronous<00:00:30.609> because<00:00:31.609> as<00:00:31.819> you

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
of gonna be asynchronous because as you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.440 
of gonna be asynchronous because as you
can<00:00:32.060> see<00:00:32.119> in<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.509> lower<00:00:32.689> left<00:00:32.890> there's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
can see in the lower left there's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.700 
can see in the lower left there's
there's<00:00:35.450> standing<00:00:35.990> so<00:00:36.200> there's<00:00:36.380> gonna<00:00:36.500> be

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
there's standing so there's gonna be

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.610 
there's standing so there's gonna be
leaderboards<00:00:37.370> for<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.820> towers<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.380> first

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
leaderboards for the towers so the first

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.000 
leaderboards for the towers so the first
one<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.120> novice<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.450> it's<00:00:41.900> five<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:42.830> five

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
one is novice and it's five it's five

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.610 
one is novice and it's five it's five
characters<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:44.600> have<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.870> get<00:00:45.020> through<00:00:45.320> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
characters you have to get through and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.550 
characters you have to get through and
the<00:00:45.920> AI<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.400> probably<00:00:46.970> pretty<00:00:47.300> easy<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.990> it

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
the AI is probably pretty easy and it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.410 
the AI is probably pretty easy and it
just<00:00:48.800> gets<00:00:49.010> increasingly<00:00:49.460> difficult<00:00:49.940> as<00:00:50.390> you

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
just gets increasingly difficult as you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.140 
just gets increasingly difficult as you
go<00:00:50.660> up<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.170> second<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.040> third<00:00:52.190> one<00:00:52.430> are

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
go up the second and third one are

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.810 
go up the second and third one are
warrior<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:53.990> champion<00:00:54.560> and<00:00:54.800> if<00:00:55.610> you've

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
warrior and champion and if you've

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.330 
warrior and champion and if you've
played<00:00:56.150> some<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.630> old<00:00:56.780> MKS<00:00:57.530> then<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.160> know

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
played some of the old MKS then you know

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.310 
played some of the old MKS then you know
that<00:00:58.610> they've<00:00:59.180> always<00:00:59.390> had<00:00:59.660> kind<00:00:59.990> of<00:01:00.079> like

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
that they've always had kind of like

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.740 
that they've always had kind of like
three<00:01:00.770> towers<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.670> novice<00:01:02.210> warrior<00:01:02.630> and

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
gameplay we're like we'd have no head

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.020 
gameplay we're like we'd have no head
and<00:01:39.200> there's<00:01:39.409> no<00:01:39.619> jumping<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.490> they<00:01:40.700> would<00:01:40.850> do

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
and there's no jumping and they would do

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.610 
and there's no jumping and they would do
a<00:01:41.060> match<00:01:41.359> like<00:01:41.659> that

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
a match like that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.530 
a match like that
but<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.860> mk9<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.550> was<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.670> single<00:01:44.060> match<00:01:44.240> after

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
but in mk9 it was a single match after

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.270 
but in mk9 it was a single match after
you<00:01:44.780> were<00:01:44.870> done<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.320> would<00:01:45.470> kind<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:46.160> know

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
you were done it would kind of you know

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.550 
you were done it would kind of you know
put<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.670> back<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.180> main<00:01:47.420> screen<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:48.440> you

put you back to the main screen and you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.920 
put you back to the main screen and you
have<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.950> keep<00:01:49.130> going<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:50.240> seems<00:01:50.540> like<00:01:50.630> it's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
have to keep going this seems like it's

have to keep going this seems like it's
gonna<00:01:51.050> be<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.350> whole<00:01:51.650> tower<00:01:52.570> that's<00:01:53.570> kind<00:01:53.900> of

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
gonna be a whole tower that's kind of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.830 
gonna be a whole tower that's kind of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.900 
to the gameplay which i think is really
fun<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:06.290> next<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:06.800> test<00:02:07.100> your<00:02:07.220> my<00:02:07.520> time

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
one is endless and endless this sounds

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.000

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
that Tower and get as high as you can so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.080 
that Tower and get as high as you can so
that<00:02:50.930> was<00:02:51.500> always<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.800> really<00:02:52.070> great<00:02:52.400> idea<00:02:52.580> from

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
that was always a really great idea from

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.600 
that was always a really great idea from
the<00:02:53.270> old<00:02:53.450> MKS<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.739> wasn't<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> huge<00:02:55.310> fan<00:02:55.340> of

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
the old MKS I just wasn't a huge fan of

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.370 
the old MKS I just wasn't a huge fan of
the<00:02:56.030> 3d<00:02:56.510> MKS<00:02:56.959> except<00:02:57.709> for<00:02:57.890> maybe<00:02:58.160> mk4<00:02:59.200> but<00:03:00.200> I'm

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
the 3d MKS except for maybe mk4 but I'm

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.620 
the 3d MKS except for maybe mk4 but I'm
actually<00:03:01.010> pretty<00:03:01.489> glad<00:03:01.910> they're<00:03:02.180> bringing

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
actually pretty glad they're bringing

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.699 
actually pretty glad they're bringing
that<00:03:02.660> back<00:03:03.020> because<00:03:03.970> especially<00:03:04.970> with<00:03:05.209> them

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
that back because especially with them

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.860 
that back because especially with them
with<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.860> leaderboards<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.640> stuff<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.630> if

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
with the leaderboards and stuff so if

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.510 
with the leaderboards and stuff so if
you<00:03:09.020> can<00:03:09.170> kind<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.560> bragging<00:03:10.070> rights<00:03:10.100> if

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
you can kind of have bragging rights if

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.400 
you can kind of have bragging rights if
you<00:03:10.670> get<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.180> high<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.720> endless<00:03:11.989> and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
you get really high on the endless and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.729 
you get really high on the endless and
then<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.400> last<00:03:13.580> one<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:13.910> survivor<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:15.050> I'm

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
then the last one is survivor and I'm

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.110 
then the last one is survivor and I'm
thinking<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.370> will<00:03:16.550> be<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.700> lot<00:03:16.940> like

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
thinking this will be a lot like

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.820 
thinking this will be a lot like
survivor<00:03:17.660> mode

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
survivor mode

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.070 
survivor mode
injustice<00:03:19.970> where<00:03:20.970> you'll<00:03:21.630> probably<00:03:21.840> have

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
injustice where you'll probably have

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.780 
injustice where you'll probably have
like<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> tower<00:03:22.650> that's<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.550> eight

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
like a tower that's like eight

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.190 
like a tower that's like eight
characters<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:25.100> if<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.400> get<00:03:26.970> damaged<00:03:27.720> dealt

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
characters and if you get damaged dealt

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.710 
characters and if you get damaged dealt
to<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.950> fight<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.580> go<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> next<00:03:30.480> fight

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
to you in a fight you go the next fight

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.110 
to you in a fight you go the next fight
with<00:03:31.020> like<00:03:31.380> while<00:03:31.890> keeping<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.460> damage<00:03:32.910> so

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
with like while keeping that damage so

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880 
with like while keeping that damage so
you're<00:03:33.330> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.810> next<00:03:34.230> fight<00:03:34.440> with<00:03:34.650> not

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
you're going to that next fight with not

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.640 
you're going to that next fight with not
a<00:03:34.920> full<00:03:35.220> health<00:03:35.430> they'll<00:03:36.330> probably<00:03:36.570> be<00:03:36.960> things

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
a full health they'll probably be things

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.550 
a full health they'll probably be things
like<00:03:37.980> little<00:03:38.340> challenges<00:03:39.120> mid-game<00:03:39.930> that

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
like little challenges mid-game that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.010 
like little challenges mid-game that
kind<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.950> give<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> health<00:03:42.270> boost<00:03:42.570> at<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
kind of give you a health boost at the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.300 
kind of give you a health boost at the
end<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.590> match

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
end of the match

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.120 
end of the match
I<00:03:44.340> don't<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:46.110> basically<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.740> kind<00:03:47.010> of

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
I don't know so basically this kind of

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.240 
I don't know so basically this kind of
looks<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.460> something<00:03:48.590> similar<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.860> what

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
looks like something similar to what

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
looks like something similar to what
battles<00:03:51.090> mode<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:52.190> injustice<00:03:53.190> which<00:03:54.120> is

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
battles mode is in injustice which is

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.950 
battles mode is in injustice which is
pretty<00:03:54.480> cool<00:03:54.720> because<00:03:56.000> mk9<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.390> really<00:03:57.780> like

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
pretty cool because mk9 I really like

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
alright next is the online towers which

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.400 
alright next is the online towers which
this<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.340> pretty<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.480> pretty<00:04:24.690> exciting<00:04:25.080> I

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
this is pretty this is pretty exciting I

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.940 
this is pretty this is pretty exciting I
think<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.100> gonna<00:04:26.880> be<00:04:27.290> more<00:04:28.290> like<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
think this is gonna be more like the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.540 
think this is gonna be more like the
challenge<00:04:29.490> tower<00:04:29.790> from<00:04:30.560> MK<00:04:31.560> 9<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.220> one<00:04:32.370> that

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
challenge tower from MK 9 the one that

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.540 
challenge tower from MK 9 the one that
was<00:04:32.670> like<00:04:32.850> 300<00:04:33.830> fights<00:04:34.830> but<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.220> was<00:04:35.340> all<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
was like 300 fights but it was all I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.640 
was like 300 fights but it was all I
kind<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.270> stuck<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:36.930> with<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.080> character<00:04:37.620> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
kind of stuck you with the character and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.910 
kind of stuck you with the character and
gave<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.310> challenges<00:04:38.990> this<00:04:39.990> seems<00:04:40.410> like<00:04:40.680> it's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
gave you challenges this seems like it's

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.670 
gave you challenges this seems like it's
gonna<00:04:41.100> be<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.400> little<00:04:41.790> more<00:04:42.290> optimal<00:04:43.290> than<00:04:43.500> that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
gonna be a little more optimal than that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.340 
gonna be a little more optimal than that
because<00:04:44.010> you're<00:04:44.520> not<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:45.200> don't<00:04:46.200> know<00:04:46.260> if

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
because you're not I don't know if

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.780 
because you're not I don't know if
you're<00:04:46.500> stuck<00:04:46.830> with<00:04:47.040> a<00:04:47.100> certain<00:04:47.610> character

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
you're stuck with a certain character

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.990 
you're stuck with a certain character
but<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:49.680> looks<00:04:49.860> like<00:04:49.920> there's<00:04:50.310> daily<00:04:50.790> there's

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
but it looks like there's daily there's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.700 
but it looks like there's daily there's
quick<00:04:51.300> which<00:04:51.600> is<00:04:51.780> probably<00:04:52.170> just<00:04:52.500> something

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
quick which is probably just something

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.550 
quick which is probably just something
you<00:04:52.950> can<00:04:53.130> go<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.520> do<00:04:53.610> anytime<00:04:54.080> there's<00:04:55.080> daily

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
you can go and do anytime there's daily

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.420 
you can go and do anytime there's daily
which<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.460> probably<00:04:56.790> gonna<00:04:56.940> be<00:04:57.030> as<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.390> set

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
which is probably gonna be as like a set
