to start conserving climbing areas on a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:41.650 
to start conserving climbing areas on a
scale<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.640> we've<00:00:23.790> never<00:00:23.970> done

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.470 

I've<00:00:42.170> been<00:00:42.350> very<00:00:42.530> fortunate<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.340> over<00:00:43.670> five

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
I've been very fortunate that over five

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.330 
I've been very fortunate that over five
decades<00:00:44.960> I've<00:00:45.200> been<00:00:45.380> able<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.650> enjoy<00:00:46.070> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340

pristine areas of the American

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.650 
pristine areas of the American
wilderness<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:49.880> think<00:00:50.060> it's<00:00:50.150> important

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
wilderness and I think it's important

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.290 
wilderness and I think it's important
that<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.140> coming<00:00:51.650> generations<00:00:52.250> get<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.000> enjoy

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
that the coming generations get to enjoy

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.990 
that the coming generations get to enjoy
those<00:00:53.510> areas<00:00:53.960> for<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.230> next<00:00:54.470> 50<00:00:54.740> years

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
those areas for the next 50 years

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.470 
those areas for the next 50 years
growing<00:00:56.000> up<00:00:56.270> in<00:00:56.480> rural<00:00:56.690> Alaska<00:00:56.900> I<00:00:57.500> was<00:00:58.400> in<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
growing up in rural Alaska I was in the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.800 
growing up in rural Alaska I was in the
landscape<00:00:59.960> 100%<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> time<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.630> fell<00:01:02.630> in

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
landscape 100% of the time and fell in

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.229 
landscape 100% of the time and fell in
love<00:01:03.020> with<00:01:03.260> that<00:01:03.440> feeling<00:01:03.950> of<00:01:03.980> being<00:01:04.250> in<00:01:05.000> such

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
love with that feeling of being in such

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.610 
love with that feeling of being in such
a<00:01:05.270> huge<00:01:05.720> place<00:01:06.050> and<00:01:06.440> I<00:01:08.080> strive<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.110> do<00:01:09.470> that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
a huge place and I strive to do that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.030 
a huge place and I strive to do that
still<00:01:10.010> in<00:01:10.310> my<00:01:10.760> adult<00:01:11.300> life<00:01:11.380> for<00:01:12.380> me<00:01:12.500> what<00:01:12.680> one

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
still in my adult life for me what one

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
still in my adult life for me what one
of<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.190> things<00:01:13.250> that's<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:13.640> special<00:01:14.000> about

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
of the things that's so special about

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.520 
of the things that's so special about
climbing<00:01:14.600> it's<00:01:14.720> just<00:01:14.930> having<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
climbing it's just having the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.810 
climbing it's just having the
opportunity<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:16.070> be<00:01:16.160> in<00:01:16.369> such<00:01:16.550> beautiful

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
opportunity to be in such beautiful

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.210 
opportunity to be in such beautiful
places<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.869> think<00:01:18.260> that<00:01:18.410> kind<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:18.979> gives

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
places and I think that kind of gives

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.670 
places and I think that kind of gives
you<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.430> natural<00:01:19.780> motivation<00:01:20.780> just<00:01:21.350> take<00:01:21.500> care

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
you a natural motivation just take care

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.140 
you a natural motivation just take care
of<00:01:21.770> these<00:01:21.860> places<00:01:22.130> because<00:01:22.400> because<00:01:22.940> they<00:01:23.030> are

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
of these places because because they are

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.270 
of these places because because they are
so<00:01:23.390> special<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:23.900> they<00:01:23.990> give<00:01:24.440> us<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:24.770> much<00:01:24.920> I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
so special and they give us so much I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.010 
so special and they give us so much I
think<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:25.970> really<00:01:26.150> important<00:01:26.690> for<00:01:26.900> the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
think it's really important for the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.040 
think it's really important for the
young<00:01:27.200> people<00:01:27.560> today<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.360> have<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.780> passion

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
young people today to have a passion

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.469 
young people today to have a passion
about<00:01:30.440> being<00:01:30.950> outside<00:01:31.160> so<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:32.300> can

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
about being outside so that they can

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.870 
about being outside so that they can
have<00:01:32.690> this<00:01:33.560> ease<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.070> being<00:01:34.280> with<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.550> land

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
have this ease of being with the land

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.060 
have this ease of being with the land
and<00:01:35.270> then<00:01:35.690> they<00:01:35.840> can<00:01:35.990> play<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.890> then

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
they can live in it and then they can

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.380 
they can live in it and then they can
protect<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:39.340> when<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.369> first<00:01:40.729> started<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.150> took
