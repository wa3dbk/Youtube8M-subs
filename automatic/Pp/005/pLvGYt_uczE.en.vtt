 advanced points on the red zone and who 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.649

 the first opportunity and Monegasque the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.350
 balloon over it is a good action 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.120
 for the monaco ace with ibrahima tourÃ© who 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.559
 had escaped one of the best 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.870
 scorers of the championship in loss of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.280
 speed in 2013 compared to its 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.140
 performance the previous year 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.540

 of the attak a team of monaco who is 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.930
 surprised by the 36th niortais 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.260
 minute jimmy roye for opening the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.480
 score 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.630
 he becomes sole scorer of his 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.830
 team with his 7th goal of the season and 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.420
 it's north that leads 1-0 to monaco 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.350
 a team of monaco who has yet all 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.080
 its holders 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.820

 wound but not retained by claudio 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.300
 ranieri monaco who fights until mid 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.800
 time not to be led back 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.380
 in the locker room and this is not the case 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.210
 scored 1 goal in the 45th minute thanks 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.670
 at lukas ocampo the young striker 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.700
 Argentinean third goal of the season for 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.040
 his monaco is back on the board 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.350
 mito 1 goal everywhere 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.600
 remains a very good result for 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.520
 niortais d'esmertec who only won 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.870
 two of their last six games but at 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.330
 every time against competitors 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.270
 direct that allows them to be out of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.640
 the red zone 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.840
 monaco is on 13 matches without defeat 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.759
 it would be a big surprise to see 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.440
 niort come win to louis do all the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.120
 more than in the second half 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.170
 Monegasques have other 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.959
 of strikes outside the box or 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.909
 actions that make it possible to obtain 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.590
 penalty here is the dream opportunity to 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.980
 scoring the second goal is to win the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.400
 match and ran away by the keeper 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.340
 huge double honor for 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.579
 the monaco ace is for emmanuel river 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.010
 which therefore fails especially believes him the 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.569
 guardian niortais took and the best 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.670
 on the striker of the ace monaco 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.340
 this action changes everything since in the end 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.870
 it's a draw between monaco and niort a 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.629
 everywhere a good point on the outside 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.840
 for the niortais but monaco rest 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.840
