00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 from the view yes no where he is caring 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.670
 I believe that in addition to outdoor for outdoors 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.920
 in midfield between vinyl and no it's not true 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.410
 but let me face responds to 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.980
 match with the other one we have 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.949
 lost put coma cecene moment I put 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.810
 three half tips to unhinge without 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 give reference points 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 it was played at 4 then eventually they got us 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 for if we are even a little dark 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 taken care of just to give a mentality 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 that we try until the last luthi a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 win whatever and try it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.440
 today if he has seen we are put to 4 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.120
 jesus and did the fullback came 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 even at 5 in the end alvarez and saw it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 where I put it he noticed the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.739
 tactical change guarin alvarez if the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.289
 done the 3 4 3 did not play between the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.320
 52 and with the same team we did 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.680
 four wins two draws with 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 change and methodist hernanes air e 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.690
 guarin and the two tips at some point 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.840
 I saw where to save me two 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.060
 medians the 34 to the right that he had to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 to age it was there that then we have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.840
 found spaces we arrived 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.510
 references and that there came of everything and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 we found everything they saved the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 ball inside the door, he was wrong 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 head shots in front of the goalkeeper 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.220
 already the manner of sight and the parades of the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 goalkeeper who has to make a team where 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 there were the famous episodes of which I did 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.119
 the ones you spoke too when 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.790
 they are boarding so it means that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.500
 I think of the supposed opposing school 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.380
 in order not to make you even goals widen 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.140
 arm and there if there is what owes us 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.329
 being makes a goal and wins the game 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.579
 in addition to us, all the situations that must 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.380
 make a team of everything 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.960
 in the end the last quote luthi I put 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.720
 two points two forwards on them 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.570
 central for you to force there with palacio 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.960
 behind alvarez to the right of everything it is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.119
 done 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.570
 that is, I believe that more than what I have 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.520
 made to try in the two games too 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.290
 crash even risking it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.759
 we could be perfect even today 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.320
 because when you make choices you can 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.119
 also that the Udinese in an action 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.140
 steals the ball catches you in 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.140
 counter-time makes us goals
