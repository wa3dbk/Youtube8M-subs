00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:13.709
 who has no idea about batmans 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.709
 do you want to go for something belongs 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.600
 yes, that's a good question 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.220
 where did the dark knight get his name from? 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.590
 but that there is another course in 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.840
 first to batman arkham night not at all 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.820
 in the middle of bad girl one 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:39.710
 Family matters are natural 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.960
 the female perpetrator is 1 76 eur 99 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.270
 expensive additional content he comes from 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.750
 not from rocksteady and you realize that 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.370
 clear to the game 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.870
 Compared to the main game is the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.140
 batgirl episode practically in all 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.129
 been stripped down 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.159
 Although there is still the same 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.839
 fighting system it is very intuitive and before 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.350
 everything here is on counteractions 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.670
 set 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.650
 Here you can, for example, with 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.330
 Robben play together there is something like that 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.159
 two-three times throughout the episode 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.300
 which lasts about an hour long 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.830
 who, however, the main game already 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.479
 has played and you can go out 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.280
 if you like the batgirl episode 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.820
 then you want to play a lot 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.770
 miss 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.810
 For example, there is no wayne tech 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.960
 tree no 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.760
 development opportunities 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 there is only limited access 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.009
 gadgets that if we back later 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.009
 look at us 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.450
 the new download content allowed 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490
 overall only very little 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.900
 freedom of movement 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.010
 the area where you are playing 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 is very small 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.930
 some even newer some areas 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.770
 warmed up so you visit the halt 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.509
 more often from the almost sublime 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.610
 glide that one envious of bed 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.240
 actually knows very little here 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.920
 to feel 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 the areas are small and very 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.610
 Restricted mostly you run praise 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.979
 and try to get to the next one 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.930
 to find areal 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.950
 in short, there is an open world feeling 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.910
 it in the bad girl one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.050
 Family matter not like you get here 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.090
 There can be seen in this game 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.820
 expansion very little money now in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.739
 compared to the main game now and then allowed 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.959
 you hedge a terminal or get off 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 and then jump free 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.760
 but that 's about it 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.800
 relatively tired and also from the great 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 atmosphere of the super told 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.130
 history remains because of this extension 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.380
 actually nothing left 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.940
 really, if any, then there is 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.980
 such action is over 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.079
 television monitors are recorded 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.880
 very few cutscenes are still 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.840
 in addition to a little bit the players at 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.959
 to hold the pole 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.579
 that was it but who already 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.079
 expected now more about the joker 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.239
 to learn or learn more about the 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.110
 story of bad girl robin who can 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.110
 unfortunately make-up 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.780
 As I said there are in the whole addon 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.940
 four hardly any development possibilities 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.820
 not really a character for the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.410
 it just simply goes bang up in principle 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.870
 worked out then from time to time 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.780
 bit scanned or hacked and that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.730
 it was already investigative research 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.230
 like in the main game you can unfortunately here 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.890
 do not expect that there is 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.890
 simply not 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.780
 and also the end of this conceivably short one 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.580
 Episode is relatively unspectacular 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.470
 staged while acting here also reverberate 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.790
 and the joker with it but that they themselves 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.769
 just profane here at the fight 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.530
 so far not participate so what 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.970
 I expected from the end and how 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.830
 it should be different too 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.420
 Of course we will conclude 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.160
 Cliffhanger served under the stroke 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.750
 I'm pretty much of that first addon 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.340
 disappointed neither brings with it 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.200
 story-technically and further it is 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.450
 playful in total, too 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.560
 slimmed down and in the end it is not synonymous 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.930
 open world game more of batman arkham 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.819
 sorry I'm excited for me is the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.950
 a candidate for the game of the year though 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.829
 this style you really can 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.150
 Forgotten forget 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.950
 fortunately, it is already clear that 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.359
 rocksteady take over the scepter again 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.900
 when it comes to the next extension 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.370
 by batman arkham night is going off 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.680
 august it should be new content again 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.180
 give and I hope that also the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.570
 do not change joker or article 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.160
 can 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.160
 that it starts again then really 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.580
 pity that batgirl does not convince 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.010
 but could see what the future 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.010
 bye and thank you for turning it on
