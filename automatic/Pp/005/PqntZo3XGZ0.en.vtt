00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 with tears here as in where the one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 again I know that is not seen on the screen 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.120
 but now if you are going to start seeing like this 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.349
 how good we are already here in the interface 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.719
 of xbox and this is going to be a small 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.710
 tutorial for this to see how you guys 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.840
 how to install an xbox 360 game to 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 your record the first thing we have to see 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.600
 is if you have space this is the system 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.330
 storage to your hard drive shipments 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.949
 of 120 gigabytes but it is full as 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.439
 you can see the keeps you free 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.870
 and each in each game people of 5 gigs 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.090
 more or less then this first what 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 we have to have inserted our 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.390
 game in our xbox we give you details 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.720
 of the game with X and here then here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.990
 says install 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.330
 she and they will ask hey and for what 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.520
 for this what is it for later 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.490
 many things at first 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.650
 this your xbox at the moment that you put 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.690
 the game is going to play it is going to put 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.430
 from the hard drive that means no 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.830
 will make so much noise and therefore not 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
 it's going to heat up because it's not using 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.690
 the dvd reader how can you tell 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.530
 some of you this they put their games and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.960
 it sounds like life until it vibrates and all that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.850
 and it's annoying is the noise then to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.680
 time to install the game is no longer going to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 make those noises is going to be going to be 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.100
 as if you were playing a demo 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.500
 because when you play a demo the play 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.940
 from the good hard drive it grabs 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.759
 from the hard drive then they do not 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.420
 no noise and this is a small 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.080
 advantage for 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.400
 for this to install your games and 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.850
 some loading times of some 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 games east 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.680
 they stop taking good they are removed by 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.920
 example some loading time of 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.690
 loading a game from loading to a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.330
 little bit faster is not much 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 difference but if we load faster and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.930
 what else 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 will tell me hey and if I ask my friends 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.970
 other games in those already installed 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.799
 to be able to play not because at the moment of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.840
 that you put this starts the game is going 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.030
 to ask you to put the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 the game the disc inserted is the disc 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.560
 so you can read it from the disk 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.810
 hard then do not have a joke this is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.670
 because he has to read the disc and try 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.030
 that you have it inside and it's original and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.190
 then this from the hard drive or by 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.799
 example there is some I have this some 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.980
 cases that buy their games and they 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.200
 some parts of the game fail this 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.450
 installing the game could not serve 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.790
 then what you would have to do to 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.840
 solve the game is this polish the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.540
 disc that costs you about 60 pesos or that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.090
 go to the front blockbuster is the game 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.069
 that you want good the game that you do not 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.489
 you have but it does not work that you get stuck in 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.790
 somewhere you install it and that's it 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.210
 easy it would be without any error 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.000
 game you could play 100% 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.610
 and this is more than anything, if it's a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.350
 advantage so that your xbox does not get hot 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.400
 so much 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.860
 this makes less noise because that more than 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.290
 nothing gamers and well I have installed 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.470
 all the games that I have because then 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.500
 it's very useful a tool very very 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.840
 good I have all my games I have like 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.670
 20 30 games installed on my hard drive 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.830

 finish now when they finish put the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.460
