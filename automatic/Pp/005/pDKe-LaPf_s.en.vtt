00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.359
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell about 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.680
 key points 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.010
 Istanbul Convention on Temporary Admission 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.889
 vehicles we all see as 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.320
 the streets of our cities every day all 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.090
 more and more cars with Lithuanian 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.550
 rooms also with Polish 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 but with polish less and maybe after 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.460
 watching this video someone 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 finally still for yourself 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 decide to bring 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.969
 such cars are either not worth it so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.540
 the one who promises to drive you 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.329
 not cleared car 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.989
 I will talk about this person often 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.180
 so initially I will call him when the racer 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:50.550
 Here you have a car racer 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 the company in lithuania we take as a basis lithuania you 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 must be an employee 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.210
 this of his Lithuanian company therefore from 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.480
 documents to you when the racer should 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 provide employment contract 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 the car will be decorated not on you but on 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.299
 Lithuanian is this company and you are already 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.100
 the employee will use this company 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 the car in Ukraine 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.680
 commercial purposes exclusively in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 commercial not personal according to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 Istanbul Convention yes yes so c 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.340
 I turn to the Ukrainian language yes yes 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.220
 so all the traffic blockages article 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 porsche item b com active cross not 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.439
 means a charge carried both of hoarse 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.740
 maritime shako martin and paid a woman 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.960
 for paid on live 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 from this you must understand that already on 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.460
 customs you will need to confirm 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.070
 documented commercial use 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.700
 car whether you are transporting 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.770
 passengers either load but if you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.250
 drive cars on order 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.409
 most likely it will be already 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.380
 the problem with the rider is not yours is he already 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.119
 at customs will understand but you 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.700
 must understand what to ride afterwards 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.860
 all the same to you and therefore will be useful 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.790
 documents confirming commercial 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.380
 using a car in Ukraine with 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.560
 it sorted out now 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.050
 go to the deadlines all for some reason say 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.430
 that you can ride one here and then you need 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.710
 take out the car and squeal back but 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.920
 Istanbul Convention on this occasion 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.130
 says another 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.080
 Article 7 says that the goods have 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.910
 including transport for over a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.430
 hours an appeal to their boom at this 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.130
 matured you are not as if exportation is not alas 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.460
 the digit term called will give from him for 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.800
 reach and you watch someone cut it 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.140
 term has sufficient purpose 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.650
 mention of the term in the dermal cream to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.710
 dotku 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.480
 but we need yes yes so relative 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.640
 commercial vehicles 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.240
 of use 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 this is article 9 of the convention which 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.580
 says that away from the export is not 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.890
 transport zaz upholstery mars skill 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.740
 growth is not a tip after a spire 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.170
 completed transport operations for to their 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.930
 Won boules in the zone that is based on 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.390
 of the above you can not drive 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.270
 one year until you finish your 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.200
 commercial affairs on this car in 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.950
 Ukraine, why everyone says one year I do not 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.290
 I know when the driver is profitable maybe 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.350
 the fact that he will take a divorce 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:40.590
 money for what comes out and goes back to 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.650
 in Ukraine here I know that in Istanbul 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.760
 convention one year it's relative 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.880
 cars which is used in 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.140
 personal purposes but we need 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.470
 What about commercial goals now? 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.150
 in Ukraine they wrote some letter there 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.060
 you there and service and term supposedly but it 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.510
 supposedly the law which states the terms in 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.360
 20 days and this is a violation of all of which 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.520
 only possible and the Istanbul Convention in 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.920
 particular that Ukraine has long been 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.890
 joined and now all sorts 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.130
 violate what is fraught with consequences like 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.380
 for Ukraine and for citizens and 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.630
 Finally, if you still have to 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.150
 it will be necessary either through here and since all 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.229
 burn take out the car 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.240
 either just take the car you 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.669
 can not necessarily through that customs 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.210
 through which you took on this 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.900
 car confirmation of this article 11 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.370
 convention well it's basically all 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.810
 information that is about this need 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.880
 maybe after this video someone 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.919
 all the same, finally decide 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.300
 Is it worth it to drive such a non-customs 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.610
 the car is either not up to you all 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.289
