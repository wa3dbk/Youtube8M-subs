00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 comes in the figure of the keychain of a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 troll that I do not like as it looks by 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 outside but good is interested 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.680

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.230

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 get in a week or 10 days 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.070
 approximately what I need then 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 well let's open the keychain 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.239
 to see how it is 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.189
 hard 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.930
 this already comes with 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.930
 to clasp cited as 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.030
 you can bring the light 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.920
 then it's not as ugly as it came in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.229
 the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.940
 in the picture but not me anyway 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.510
 looking for 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.000
 I believe that 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.970
 This face does not look much like the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.030
 of a drone this author in fact if he 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.610
 Fix the keychain bring them the eyes 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.470
 lengthened upwards and the throne the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.360
 It has therefore normal that is the case 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.360
 better elongated towards the sides 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.380
 I do not see him much similarity 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.960
 the body is fine it 's nice it's 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.470
 nice but the face was that of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.810
 flat nothing else out there one of my 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.370
