00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
for the Nintendo 64 in my opinion I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.920

think<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.180> actually<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.480> little<00:00:36.629> bit<00:00:36.780> better

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
think it's actually a little bit better

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
think it's actually a little bit better
than<00:00:37.080> mario<00:00:37.410> kart<00:00:37.650> 64<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:38.400> it<00:00:38.640> kind<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
than mario kart 64 because it kind of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.619 
than mario kart 64 because it kind of
mixes<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.879> platformer<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> racing

mixes the a platformer with a racing

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
mixes the a platformer with a racing
game<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.080> adds<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.530> other<00:00:43.890> stuff<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.400> there

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
