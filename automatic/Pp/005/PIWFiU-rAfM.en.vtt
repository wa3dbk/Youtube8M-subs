00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.120
 Last year, housing prices in China suddenly skyrocketed. By the first quarter of 2014, price increases have slowed compared to the same period last year. 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.740
 Although developers have used a lot of advertising techniques, the housing market growth has shown signs of going down. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.860
 Following this momentum, will the Chinese real estate market collapse? 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.420
 How will the rich people be affected? And who will become the victim of this price drop? 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.840
 Please listen to the analysts. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:38.320
 The Wall Street Journal report in mid-March 2014 said that experts from the China Development Forum pointed out that high school and high school cities in China are different from tier 1 and tier 2 cities. . 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.700
 Falling house prices do not mean exploding the housing market bubble in China. 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.860
 Financial analyst Nham Trung Dao said that the recent developments in the real estate market have reflected its own unfavorable future. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.080
 The difference between the ranks of cities is actually the difference in housing needs. 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.460
 The Middle School: "If the CCP let the real estate market collapse, it will collapse as well; 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.360
 It does not want this to happen, so it will boost the printing of money by using national resources to fill the gap. 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.620
 That is the style of the CCP. ” 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.160
 [Mr. Zheng, a Chinese economist]: "The situation is very serious. From the beginning, real estate in China contained many risks. This may be the collapse of a complex system. ” 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.780
 According to the Tan Tan website, due to the impact of credit tightening and commercial housing ownership, 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:39.820
 In the first week of April, from March 31 to April 6, the Beijing housing market only had 2,587 transactions, including both new and old home sales, down 22% from the same period last year. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.680
 In March, the price of old homes in Beijing fell to about 31,400 yuan per square meter, down 0.6% from February. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 There are 8,943 transactions, this is the lowest price since 2009. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.720
 Qin Huang Dao is likened to "Beijing post-Academy" Some houses here have discounted up to 40%. With such a large amount of backlog, it could become a ghost town. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.940
 In Hangzhou, the price of a house also fell by nearly 1 million yuan. 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.740
 If housing prices continue to fall, who will suffer the most by this bubble explosion? 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:23.020
 An English-language website cited the China Housing Finance University's Financial Investigations report as follows: "Falling housing prices mainly affect the middle class." 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 However, financial adviser Gong Sheng Loi argued that the middle class in China is not high. 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:47.080
 [Gong Shengli]: "The victims are really poor people, there are about 500 million Chinese people including those who earn only $ 1 a day, even the poor are just waiting to die. 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.960
 The middle class only has about 300 million people. ” 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.320
 Mr. Zheng also thought that the so-called middle class did not have much. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.740
 Most middle classes are at the bottom of society, and they buy houses for the purpose of staying. 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.800
 Nham Trung Dao said that middle-class people can spend 1 million yuan to buy new houses who are affected by the housing market. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.420
 They are a separate group in the economic system in China. 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.760
 [Siddhartha]: "Certainly the victims are the people. There are houses worth 50,000 yuan in just one night. There really are things like that. ” 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.940
 So, how does the price drop affect the rich? 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.880
 [The Middle School]: "These people are not affected too much. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:45.300
 Most rich people have gone abroad to live and convert properties. The CCP's senior officials have much faster sources of information and reactions than the masses. " 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:55.120
 Earlier this year, Ho Nhuan Research Institute published a survey showing that the migration rate among rich people in China reached 64%, of which one-third of billionaires went abroad to live. 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.220
 According to the Wall Street Journal's China and Global Center data in January, over the past 23 years, the migration rate in China has increased by 128%. 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:12.720
 In 2011, more than 2,800 billion yuan was transferred abroad, accounting for 3% of GDP in 2011. 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.220
 The Chinese have become the second largest group of foreigners to buy real estate in the United States.
