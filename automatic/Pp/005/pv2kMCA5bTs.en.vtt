00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello welcome to a new tech 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.839
 Today we are going to teach the new q 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.720
 aquarium 5.7 that we have it is any 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.180
 thing less discreet because then because 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 has a screen of that that says its 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.920
 name of 5.7 inches is to say very 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.630
 a whole screen to enjoy 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.630
 of what a smartphone is today 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.350
 between the characteristics of the bq 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.120
 aquariums 5.7 is this camera 3 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.610
 megapixels ie it is a resolution 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.250
 quite interesting that allows us 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.370
 so take advantage of what is your great 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.910
 screen to see our pictures 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.620
 for example to the part for 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.720
 electronic books or emails oa 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.660
 any activity that requires to see 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.530
 well a screen another feature 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.930
 interesting about this aquarium 5.7 one of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.520
 them is that it carries double card is 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.979
 say that we can use two numbers 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.369
 different phone numbers in the same 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.470
 apparatus and another is your great matter of 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.770
 4000 milliamps that means that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.080
 will last us long despite having a 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.930
 huge screen that is logical 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.930
 consumes more light and therefore more energy 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.240
 in short the bq waris 5.7 is a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.130
 pretty interesting alternative option 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.580
 and more affordable than others is a 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.370
 Spanish firm carries two sim cards 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 can carry at the same time and is 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.300
 within the segment known as fablet 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.410
 phone and tablet phone tablet nothing more 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.410
 until the next tech
