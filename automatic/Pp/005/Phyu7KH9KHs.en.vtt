00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.640
 what's up youtube people good 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.099
 here I bring you how to set some 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 mistakes of 'guitar hero' 3 of my 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.539
 previous video only works if it's from that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.539
 good video and some other things 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.670
 to start we go to control options 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.920
 and then to configure keyboard this alone 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.140
 works with the guitar obviously if 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.710
 they work a pc guitar not 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 they occupy doing this then let's start the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.470
 first option that is the green should 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.920
 be in the number 1 the red one should be 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.949
 in number 2 the yellow must be in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.400
 the number 4 the blue should be in the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.030
 number 3 the orange must be in the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.570
 No. 5 being power should be in the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.970
 number 6 the bard strum on 7 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.530
 to finalize that is my configuration and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.530
 it works 100% 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.350
 when you are starting the game 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.530
 we introduce the charts that is twice 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.890
 to the green and twice to red and so it is 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 ready 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.640
 As you can see, all the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.890
 songs but good now to remove 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.410
 the lefty controls that is a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.960
 annoy good unless you're left-handed and 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.690
 you leave them like this we put any song 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.750
 and starting we're going to pause and then 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.390
 options and where it says left and flip the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.320
 we select and subtract the song and 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.320
 that would be fine 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.470
 good friends please give me like 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 video if you help them in something this is all 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.340
 until next time
