 players says what is the merit to pass 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 by penal but by penal also one 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.110
 can be world champion from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.110
 South Africa Pablo Tiburzi 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.040
 well the round of 16 was already closed 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.010
 there are four South American teams in the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.590
 The last room to enter was 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.440
 paraguay a historic moment for the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.590
 Guarani football since he won from the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.990
 point of the criminal as we see in images to 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.810
 capón then the great victory of spain 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.160
 before portugal paraguay entered the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.680
 great history of world football 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.350
 because for the first time he 's in fourth 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.690
 of final and will be just the rival of 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.270
 Spain what did he do to get to 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 this instance very much a job in 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.910
 Silence of an Argentine the Tata Martino 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.820
 three values ​​of course that integrate 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.110
 also this campus but beyond 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.650
 everything has the same 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.220
 even performance 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.680
 with speeches japan and you yourself 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.160
 for different circumstances 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.220
 we should say in the physical aspect in 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.380
 first place our most solid the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.770
 Paraguayan team 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.220
 both were enough to morocco 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.130
 we added little this ball in 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.300
 the pure crossbar be of stopper when 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.300
 it came to us to warn 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.270
 guaraníes looked for ortigosa 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.990
 was the owner of the midfield finished the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.730
 actions the centers will leave 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.370
 from morel to garetto 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.990
 something worthy all 90 minutes is 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.810
 they were goalless 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.490
 but in total 120 made of lucas 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.470
 neighborhoods 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.470
 and this one was the clearest 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.110
 and a match 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.560
 it also balances 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.780
 it was defined from the point of the criminal 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.190
 [Applause] 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.220
 fingers of your hand in key 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.030
 later 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.680
 global wave 42 and 43 tacuara 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.010
 cardozo scored the last one that gave him 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.260
 actually the great victory for the team 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.780
 Paraguayan from point 53 and from 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.100
 this way in quarterfinals out 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.080
 you are aware of what was being 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.720
 living in Paraguay at this time yes 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.870
 the truth that yes sure they are so 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.620
 like crazy people there for the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.300
 street making caravan and the truth that 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.280
 very happy for what we did today 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.840
 inside the court had to reach 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.260
 the penalties if in any case if not 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.190
 we made the goals I think we were not going to 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.850
 define in penal and that for today was of 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.020
 interest 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.020
 [Applause] 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.030
 I believe that Paraguay is in a position 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:50.810
 to give a fight demonstrating what 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.889
 proved today never to be delivered out there 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.680
 we will have some difficulty in playing 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.620
 but the team is leaving everything and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.719
 thanks to that that effort the delivery 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.189
 I think we are passing stages and the 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.879
 once also making history that's very 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.879
 important to us 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.040
 and they suffer a lot they did a great 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.380
 effort and the two teams made a 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 great effort and 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.620
 I was on our side is a step to 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.020
 the glory as you said in this week 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.509
 it is a is one more step 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.050
 hopefully we can be and recover for 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.280
 keep making history this is not 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.280
 still what we want 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.939
