see<00:02:58.709> right<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.900> they're<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:00.930> set<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.680> sleep

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.810 

so<00:03:05.640> what<00:03:06.090> I've<00:03:06.270> been<00:03:06.450> doing<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.459> just<00:03:08.519> go

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
so what I've been doing is I just go

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.020 
so what I've been doing is I just go
shut<00:03:09.180> them<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:10.160> set<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.400> them<00:03:11.610> down<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
shut them or set all of them down to

shut down on the lid and the only

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.690

difference<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.900> them<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.470> asking<00:03:19.950> what

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
difference is on them that's asking what

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.610 
difference is on them that's asking what
you<00:03:20.820> want<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.330> batteries<00:03:21.750> if

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
you're using the battery and the other

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.620 
you're using the battery and the other
one<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.260> you're<00:03:26.090> charging<00:03:27.090> your<00:03:27.330> unit

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
