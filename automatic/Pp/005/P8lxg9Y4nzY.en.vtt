00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.760 
little bit harder to notice but see
right<00:00:06.420> here<00:00:06.660> how<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.410> background

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
right here how we have this background

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.560 
right here how we have this background
of<00:00:08.130> purl<00:00:08.340> stitches<00:00:08.610> like<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.330> then<00:00:09.450> all

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
of purl stitches like that and then all

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.330 
of purl stitches like that and then all
of<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.750> sudden<00:00:09.780> we've<00:00:10.559> got<00:00:10.800> two<00:00:11.010> knit<00:00:11.309> stitches

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340

of a sudden we've got two knit stitches
here<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:13.049> happened<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.530> if<00:00:13.799> we

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
here so I think what happened was if we

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.039 
here so I think what happened was if we
look<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> backside<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> may<00:00:15.929> happen

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
look at the backside and this may happen

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.689 
look at the backside and this may happen
to<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.379> that's<00:00:16.529> why<00:00:16.680> I'm<00:00:16.830> making<00:00:17.369> these

show<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> something<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:31.740> better<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
show you something even better so I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.499 
show you something even better so I
could<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.240> read

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
could do that I could just go and read

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.789 
could do that I could just go and read
pearl<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.049> looks<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> little

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
pearl it looks like it's a little

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
pearl it looks like it's a little
difficult<00:01:34.950> especially<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.390> knit

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
difficult especially if you don't knit

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
difficult especially if you don't knit
continental<00:01:37.140> style<00:01:37.290> doing<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
continental style doing it with your

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.530 
continental style doing it with your
right<00:01:38.490> hand<00:01:38.520> trying<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> loop

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
right hand trying to get that loop

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
right hand trying to get that loop
around<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.290> hard<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.979> turn<00:01:41.759> your

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
around is going to be hard so turn your

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
around is going to be hard so turn your
work<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
work around because we know that the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.469 
work around because we know that the
opposite<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> purl<00:01:45.030> stitch<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> knit

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
opposite of a purl stitch is a knit

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
opposite of a purl stitch is a knit
stitch<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.590> easily<00:01:47.369> come<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> instead<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
stitch we can easily come and instead of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
stitch we can easily come and instead of
curling<00:01:48.869> these<00:01:49.200> stitches<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.710> could<00:01:49.860> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
curling these stitches we could just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.999 
curling these stitches we could just
knit<00:01:50.220> them<00:01:50.399> right<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> wrong<00:01:51.360> side<00:01:52.009> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
knit them right from the wrong side so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980 
knit them right from the wrong side so
what<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.490> instead<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.750> move

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
what we can do instead is just move

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.920 
what we can do instead is just move
these<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.860> left<00:01:56.070> hand<00:01:56.280> needle<00:01:56.659> let's<00:01:57.659> put

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
these to the left hand needle let's put

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.789 
these to the left hand needle let's put
that<00:01:58.079> yarn<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.710> back<00:01:58.740> now<00:02:00.380> let's<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:01.530> get

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that yarn in back now let's actually get

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.459 
that yarn in back now let's actually get
it<00:02:01.920> entirely<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.350> back

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it entirely all the way in the back

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.569 
it entirely all the way in the back
because<00:02:04.710> we're<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.189> knitting<00:02:05.430> right

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
because we're going to be knitting right

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.950 
because we're going to be knitting right
there<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.030> let's<00:02:06.210> put<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> back<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
there we go let's put it in the back and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
there we go let's put it in the back and
I'll<00:02:07.530> show<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.770> I'll<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.550> remind<00:02:09.090> you

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
because I showed you this before but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.350 
because I showed you this before but
here's<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:10.860> trick<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.580> easily<00:02:11.940> renate

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
here's a little trick to easily renate

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.000 
here's a little trick to easily renate
your<00:02:12.480> ship<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:12.810> put<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> loop<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.530> your<00:02:13.680> yard

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
your ship just put the loop of your yard

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.390 
your ship just put the loop of your yard
across<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> tip<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.090> left<00:02:15.510> hand<00:02:15.689> needle

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
across the tip of that left hand needle

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.679 
across the tip of that left hand needle
using<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> right<00:02:17.580> hand<00:02:17.790> needle<00:02:17.849> just<00:02:18.480> take

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
using the right hand needle just take

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.640 
using the right hand needle just take
this<00:02:18.900> stitch<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.379> flip<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.040> over<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.519> off

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
this stitch and flip it over and off

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.259 
this stitch and flip it over and off
creating<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.769> new<00:02:22.890> knit<00:02:23.069> stitch<00:02:23.310> move<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.150> to

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
creating a new knit stitch move that to

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.630 
creating a new knit stitch move that to
the<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.480> needle<00:02:24.659> and<00:02:24.930> do<00:02:25.409> it<00:02:25.500> again<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.489> this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the right needle and do it again so this

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.860 
the right needle and do it again so this
way<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.760> don't<00:02:26.879> have<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.180> pull<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.720> just

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
way you don't have to pull you can just

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.839 
way you don't have to pull you can just
read<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> put<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.620> over<00:02:28.769> there<00:02:28.980> take<00:02:29.700> this

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
read it it put that over there take this

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.580 
read it it put that over there take this
and<00:02:30.090> sort<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.629> flip<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.959> over<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.260> off

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
and sort of just flip it over and off

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.539 
and sort of just flip it over and off
and<00:02:32.420> there<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.510> go<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.989> knit<00:02:34.290> stitches<00:02:34.549> turning

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
and there we go to knit stitches turning

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.100 
and there we go to knit stitches turning
everything<00:02:35.760> back<00:02:36.060> around<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.079> a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
everything back around so we have a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.410 
everything back around so we have a
right<00:02:37.319> side<00:02:37.560> facing<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.819> created<00:02:39.269> two

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
right side facing you see we created two

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.280 
right side facing you see we created two
purl<00:02:39.690> stitches<00:02:39.900> easily<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.799> now<00:02:41.640> we<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.970> just

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
purl stitches easily and now we can just

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.770 
purl stitches easily and now we can just
purl<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.470> like<00:02:43.829> they<00:02:43.980> were<00:02:44.010> supposed<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.519> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
purl them like they were supposed to and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.300 
purl them like they were supposed to and
again<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:45.959> if<00:02:46.620> these<00:02:46.950> look<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.159> little

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
again if if these look a little

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.770 
again if if these look a little
stretched<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.629> were

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
stretched out to you it's we were

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.630 
stretched out to you it's we were
messing<00:02:49.079> with<00:02:49.230> them<00:02:49.379> but<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:49.950> will<00:02:50.190> this

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
messing with them but this will this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.039 
messing with them but this will this
will<00:02:50.700> block<00:02:51.000> out<00:02:51.180> when<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.480> block<00:02:51.659> your<00:02:51.840> work

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
will block out when you block your work

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.780 
will block out when you block your work
any<00:02:52.319> little<00:02:52.799> stretching<00:02:53.129> like<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.579> will

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
any little stretching like that will

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.569 
any little stretching like that will
just<00:02:53.819> disappear
