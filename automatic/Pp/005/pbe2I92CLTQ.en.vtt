00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
is pretty pretty simple this is just a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.029 
is pretty pretty simple this is just a
plain<00:00:17.789> sleeve<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> box<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> nice

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
plain sleeve for the box which is a nice

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.109 
plain sleeve for the box which is a nice
black<00:00:20.689> almost<00:00:21.689> looks<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.020> carbon<00:00:22.500> fiber<00:00:22.740> box

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
black almost looks like carbon fiber box

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
black almost looks like carbon fiber box
now<00:00:24.119> when<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> open<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
now when you open it up and this is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580 
now when you open it up and this is
actually<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.840> Russian<00:00:27.840> version<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
actually the Russian version of the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.740 
actually the Russian version of the
hardware<00:00:28.859> apparently<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
hardware apparently so this is just a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.330 
hardware apparently so this is just a
little<00:00:30.929> paperwork<00:00:31.260> there's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.679> disc<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.099> here

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
little paperwork there's a disc in here

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.990 
little paperwork there's a disc in here
probably<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.969> Samsung's<00:00:33.630> pc<00:00:34.200> studio<00:00:35.000> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
probably with Samsung's pc studio and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900 
probably with Samsung's pc studio and
then<00:00:36.360> here's<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> phone<00:00:37.309> it's<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
then here's the phone it's actually a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.720 
then here's the phone it's actually a
lot<00:00:39.239> bigger<00:00:39.540> than<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> anticipated<00:00:40.730> just

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
lot bigger than I anticipated just

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.130 
lot bigger than I anticipated just
overall<00:00:42.440> looks<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:43.770> big<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
overall looks pretty big but it's a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.770 
overall looks pretty big but it's a
pretty<00:00:46.289> thin<00:00:46.620> phone<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.510> 8

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
pretty thin phone and there's the 8

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
megapixel camera back here at the LED

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.779 
megapixel camera back here at the LED
flash<00:00:51.079> you've<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> headphone<00:00:53.280> port<00:00:53.610> up

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
flash you've got the headphone port up

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.810 
flash you've got the headphone port up
top<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.770> this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:58.250> standard<00:00:59.250> 3<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> half

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
top and this is a standard 3 a half

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.380 
top and this is a standard 3 a half
millimeter<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.160> then<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> side<00:01:03.030> here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
millimeter and then on the side here

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
millimeter and then on the side here
these<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.600> volume<00:01:04.110> controls<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
these are volume controls and this is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.050 
these are volume controls and this is
where<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> micro<00:01:06.210> SD<00:01:06.510> card<00:01:06.780> slot<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.580> then<00:01:08.580> on

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
where the micro SD card slot and then on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.190 
where the micro SD card slot and then on
the<00:01:09.900> bottom<00:01:10.320> there's<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> microphone<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.200> then

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the bottom there's a microphone and then

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
the bottom there's a microphone and then
here<00:01:13.439> along<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> side<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.420> microUSB

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
here along the side this is the microUSB

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
here along the side this is the microUSB
port<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.280> shortcut<00:01:18.210> button<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
port this is the shortcut button I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
port this is the shortcut button I
assume<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> camera

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
assume and then this is the camera

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.120 
assume and then this is the camera
button<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.450> pretty<00:01:22.200> simple<00:01:22.530> hardware<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
button here so pretty simple hardware I

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640 
button here so pretty simple hardware I
mean<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> solid<00:01:24.689> touchscreen<00:01:25.259> phone<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
mean it's a solid touchscreen phone so

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.330 
mean it's a solid touchscreen phone so
we'll<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.070> into<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> software<00:01:26.700> soon<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
we'll go more into the software soon the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
we'll go more into the software soon the
back<00:01:29.700> cover<00:01:29.970> pops<00:01:30.270> off<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.869> there's<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> back

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
back cover pops off and there's the back

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.719 
back cover pops off and there's the back
of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> phone<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> pretty<00:01:33.600> simple<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:35.130> inside

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
of the phone so pretty simple the inside

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.410 
of the phone so pretty simple the inside
the<00:01:35.820> box<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.189> micro<00:01:38.189> USB<00:01:38.610> cable<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.870 

European<00:01:42.420> charger<00:01:43.079> port<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.280> adapter<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
European charger port with the adapter I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
European charger port with the adapter I
assume<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> adapters<00:01:45.810> probably<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.470> part<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
assume the adapters probably not part of

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.370 
assume the adapters probably not part of
the<00:01:46.920> package<00:01:47.100> originally<00:01:47.759> though<00:01:48.380> there's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the package originally though there's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.219 
the package originally though there's
also<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.799> pair<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.399> headphones<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.229> looked

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
also a pair of headphones that looked

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.580 
also a pair of headphones that looked
pretty<00:01:52.649> good<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:53.970> they're<00:01:54.149> any

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
pretty good I don't know if they're any

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
pretty good I don't know if they're any
sort<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.799> special<00:01:56.009> brand<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.670> anything<00:01:57.000> but

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
sort of a special brand or anything but

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.969 
sort of a special brand or anything but
pretty<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.200> headphones<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.860> an

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
pretty good headphones there is an

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
pretty good headphones there is an
inline<00:01:59.250> remote<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> be

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
inline remote here so that's going to be

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.289 
inline remote here so that's going to be
handy<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.820> original

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
handy and then here is the original

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.459 
handy and then here is the original
battery<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.420> 1500<00:02:06.420> milliamp<00:02:07.020> hour

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
battery and this is a 1500 milliamp hour

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.690 
battery and this is a 1500 milliamp hour
battery<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> same<00:02:09.030> capacity<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
battery so it's the same capacity as the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.730 
battery so it's the same capacity as the
n97<00:02:11.700> which<00:02:12.690> should<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:12.959> interesting<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> kind

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
n97 which should be interesting to kind

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.460 
n97 which should be interesting to kind
compare<00:02:14.070> how<00:02:14.190> those<00:02:14.340> two<00:02:14.550> work<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
compare how those two work so that's the
