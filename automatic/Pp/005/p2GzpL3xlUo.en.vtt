00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the pattern digital scroll down to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.520 
the pattern digital scroll down to
pattern<00:01:38.310> digital<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.540> tap<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
pattern digital I can tap on there and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
pattern digital I can tap on there and
then<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.159> even<00:01:41.460> change<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.850> clock

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210

then I can even change my clock
interface<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.159> notice<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
interface from here now you notice that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.580 
interface from here now you notice that
some<00:01:44.909> clocks<00:01:45.360> actually<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.320> settings

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
some clocks actually have some settings

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.889 
some clocks actually have some settings
where<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> tap<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> settings<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
where I can tap on the settings and I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
where I can tap on the settings and I
can<00:01:48.930> change<00:01:49.350> some<00:01:49.770> shortcuts<00:01:50.340> few<00:01:51.270> different

can change some shortcuts few different

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
can change some shortcuts few different
options<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> pedometers<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.460> so

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
options here in the pedometers and so

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.760 
options here in the pedometers and so
some<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> these<00:01:54.570> clock<00:01:54.899> interfaces<00:01:55.560> have

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
some of these clock interfaces have

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.080 
some of these clock interfaces have
different<00:01:56.159> settings<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.790> change

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
different settings that you can change

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
different settings that you can change
right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.530> side<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.189> gear<00:01:59.549> manager

right here on side the gear manager

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.090 
right here on side the gear manager
application<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.680> even<00:02:01.860> change

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
application and then I can even change

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.889 
application and then I can even change
my<00:02:02.310> clock<00:02:02.579> interface<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.329> inside<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> app

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
my clock interface here inside the app

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.469 
my clock interface here inside the app
just<00:02:04.619> by<00:02:04.770> tapping<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:06.149> going<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
just by tapping on that it's going to
