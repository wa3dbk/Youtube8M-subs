that to do it in the past I've put it on

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.160 
that to do it in the past I've put it on
the<00:01:24.710> blades<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> scissors<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the blades of the scissors and just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.390 
the blades of the scissors and just
rotated<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> slightly<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.189> nice<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
rotated it slightly to make it nice and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.819 
rotated it slightly to make it nice and
sharp<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.180> cuts<00:01:30.390> through<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
sharp so that it cuts through the the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.210 
sharp so that it cuts through the the
ear<00:01:32.009> bud<00:01:32.250> easily<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.740> how<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> go

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
ear bud easily so this is how you go

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.140 
ear bud easily so this is how you go
about<00:01:35.369> doing<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:37.400> take<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> earbud<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
about doing it take the earbud that you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020 
about doing it take the earbud that you
have<00:01:39.530> squish<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.700> nice

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
have squish it down so that it's nice

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.109 
have squish it down so that it's nice
and<00:01:42.270> flat<00:01:45.290> might<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.409> something<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.740> that

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.880 

take<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.299> scissors<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.689> cut<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.530> ear<00:01:55.680> bud

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
take your scissors and cut the ear bud

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
take your scissors and cut the ear bud
to<00:01:56.100> whatever<00:01:56.280> size<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.969> hoping<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> use<00:01:57.689> on

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
to whatever size you're hoping to use on

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.910 
to whatever size you're hoping to use on
your<00:01:58.170> pair<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> headphones<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.560> longer<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
your pair of headphones the longer you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
your pair of headphones the longer you
cut<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.640> wider<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
cut it the wider it's going to be so it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.029 
cut it the wider it's going to be so it
will<00:02:04.560> accommodate<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.310> larger<00:02:06.030> ear<00:02:06.180> canal<00:02:07.039> then

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
will accommodate a larger ear canal then

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.190 
will accommodate a larger ear canal then
you<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> leave<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.539> wait<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you have to leave it and wait for it to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
you have to leave it and wait for it to
grow<00:02:11.039> back<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.580> its<00:02:11.730> original<00:02:11.819> size<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
grow back to its original size I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.230 
grow back to its original size I
one<00:02:13.480> here<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.960> cut<00:02:14.200> earlier<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.090> can

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
one here that I cut earlier that we can

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.650 
one here that I cut earlier that we can
use<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:17.290> we'll<00:02:17.350> get<00:02:17.470> rid<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.800> one<00:02:18.600> now<00:02:19.600> you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
use so we'll get rid of that one now you

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.640 
use so we'll get rid of that one now you
take<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.440> earbud<00:02:21.900> nubbin<00:02:22.900> part<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
take the earbud nubbin part of it the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.870 
take the earbud nubbin part of it the
end<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.570> earbud<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.810> cut<00:02:25.990> off<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
end of the earbud that you cut off and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.240 
end of the earbud that you cut off and
squish<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:27.910> down<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.740> turns<00:02:29.950> into<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
squish it down so that it turns into a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.960 
squish it down so that it turns into a
circle<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:34.650> squish<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.800> nicely<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.880> in

circle like that squish it nicely and in
this<00:02:37.060> case<00:02:37.270> I'm<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.630> use<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.960> biopsy

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
this case I'm going to use the biopsy

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.770 
this case I'm going to use the biopsy
tool<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:40.270> put<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> hole<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.990> center<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.380> it

click that part out and then when it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.170 
click that part out and then when it
grows<00:02:52.060> back<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.510> its<00:02:52.660> original<00:02:52.780> size<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:55.000> might

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
grows back to its original size it might

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.610 
grows back to its original size it might
look<00:02:55.360> something<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:59.320> can<00:02:59.410> take

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
look something like this you can take

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
look something like this you can take
that<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.870> stretch<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.200> over<00:03:02.680> top<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.130> your

that and stretch it on over top of your
earbud<00:03:04.060> headphone<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:08.459> when<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.550> goes

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
earbud headphone and then when it goes

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.580 
earbud headphone and then when it goes
back<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.120> its<00:03:10.239> original<00:03:10.360> size<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.290> might<00:03:11.470> look

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
back to its original size it might look

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.590 
back to its original size it might look
something<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:13.270> can<00:03:13.420> take

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
something like that and you can take

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.280 
something like that and you can take
them<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:15.160> squish<00:03:15.489> them<00:03:15.520> down<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.989> put<00:03:17.170> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
them and squish them down and you put it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.930 
them and squish them down and you put it
in<00:03:17.380> your<00:03:17.500> ear<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.830> then<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.130> expands<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
in your ear and then it expands to the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.720 
in your ear and then it expands to the
ideal<00:03:19.720> size<00:03:20.049> for<00:03:20.080> your<00:03:20.650> ear<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.519> very

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
ideal size for your ear it's very

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.979 
ideal size for your ear it's very
comfortable<00:03:22.120> doesn't<00:03:22.570> slip<00:03:22.780> out<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
comfortable doesn't slip out and

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.960 
comfortable doesn't slip out and
provides<00:03:25.989> for<00:03:26.380> perfect<00:03:26.890> noise<00:03:27.040> isolation<00:03:27.670> in

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
provides for perfect noise isolation in

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.910 
provides for perfect noise isolation in
that<00:03:28.120> it's<00:03:28.480> meant<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.049> block<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.620> ear<00:03:29.769> canal

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
that it's meant to block the ear canal

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.850 
that it's meant to block the ear canal
that's<00:03:30.580> why<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.850> use<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.239> for<00:03:31.420> an<00:03:31.510> ear<00:03:31.630> plug

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
that's why you use it for an ear plug

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.410 
that's why you use it for an ear plug
with<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.950> hole<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.340> allows<00:03:33.670> for<00:03:33.970> sound<00:03:34.239> to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
with the hole in it allows for sound to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.780 
with the hole in it allows for sound to
come<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:35.080> from<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.440> ear<00:03:35.980> bud<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.610> not

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
come in just from the ear bud and not

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.150 
come in just from the ear bud and not
from<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> surrounding<00:03:37.510> environment<00:03:37.799> so<00:03:38.799> give

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
from the surrounding environment so give

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.789 
from the surrounding environment so give
that<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.310> try<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.540> see<00:03:40.989> how<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.200> works<00:03:41.350> for<00:03:41.500> you

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
that a try and see how it works for you

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.340 
that a try and see how it works for you
Cheers
