infection control safety and infection

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.620 
infection control safety and infection
control<00:02:56.830> now<00:02:57.830> with<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.090> mind<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.600> a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
control now with this in mind this is a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.440 
control now with this in mind this is a
huge<00:02:59.959> help<00:03:00.200> for<00:03:00.319> us<00:03:00.590> if<00:03:00.890> we<00:03:01.160> do<00:03:01.340> well<00:03:01.610> obviously

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
huge help for us if we do well obviously

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.660 
huge help for us if we do well obviously
in<00:03:02.540> these<00:03:02.630> questions<00:03:03.130> now<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.160> personally

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
in these questions now I personally

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.000 
in these questions now I personally
don't<00:03:05.269> think<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.930> infection<00:03:06.470> control<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:06.980> a

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
don't think that infection control is a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.640 
don't think that infection control is a
difficult<00:03:07.610> area<00:03:08.019> because<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.050> believe<00:03:09.410> that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
difficult area because I believe that

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.500 
difficult area because I believe that
most<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.550> nursing<00:03:10.880> students<00:03:11.209> never

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
most of the nursing students never

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.500 
most of the nursing students never
really<00:03:11.930> studied<00:03:13.060> quote-unquote<00:03:14.060> infection

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
really studied quote-unquote infection

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.069 
really studied quote-unquote infection
control<00:03:14.810> or<00:03:14.989> focus<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.580> area<00:03:16.910> when<00:03:17.120> they

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
control or focus on the area when they

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.650 
control or focus on the area when they
were<00:03:18.140> in<00:03:18.320> nursing<00:03:18.620> school

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
were in nursing school

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.569 
were in nursing school
therefore<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:20.810> lack<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.410> knowledge<00:03:21.620> did<00:03:22.430> not

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
therefore this lack of knowledge did not

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.069 
therefore this lack of knowledge did not
prepare<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.090> majority<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.810> nursing

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
prepare the majority of the nursing

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.229 
prepare the majority of the nursing
students<00:03:24.470> for<00:03:24.709> these<00:03:25.130> type<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.459> questions<00:03:25.730> in

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
students for these type of questions in

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.800 
students for these type of questions in
their<00:03:26.989> anklets<00:03:27.320> exam<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.430> let's<00:03:29.269> simplify<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
their anklets exam so let's simplify the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.720 
their anklets exam so let's simplify the
safety<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.350> infection<00:03:30.560> control<00:03:30.799> information

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
safety and infection control information

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.050 
safety and infection control information
that<00:03:32.000> we<00:03:32.780> need<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.079> know<00:03:33.200> for<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.410> NCLEX<00:03:34.060> so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
that we need to know for the NCLEX so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.430 
that we need to know for the NCLEX so
the<00:03:35.150> first<00:03:35.390> thing<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:35.810> need<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.079> know<00:03:36.230> is

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the first thing that we need to know is

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.069 
the first thing that we need to know is
to<00:03:36.820> understand<00:03:37.820> each<00:03:38.000> category<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.660> really

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
to understand each category and really

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.960 
to understand each category and really
understand<00:03:39.829> which<00:03:39.950> particular<00:03:40.579> diseases

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
understand which particular diseases

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.560 
understand which particular diseases
belongs<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.570> each<00:03:41.690> particular<00:03:42.290> category<00:03:43.570> so

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
belongs to each particular category so

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.180 
belongs to each particular category so
we<00:03:44.600> have<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.930> know<00:03:45.049> this<00:03:45.170> by<00:03:45.380> heart<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:46.070> do

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
we have to know this by heart and to do

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.130 
we have to know this by heart and to do
this<00:03:46.400> really<00:03:46.670> need<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.090> know<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.450> basics<00:03:47.900> of

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
this really need to know the basics of

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.640 
this really need to know the basics of
each<00:03:48.440> disease<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.900> first<00:03:51.200> let's<00:03:51.470> go<00:03:51.530> over

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
each disease so first let's go over

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.130 
each disease so first let's go over
standard<00:03:52.190> precautions<00:03:52.910> right<00:03:53.209> now<00:03:53.959> with

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
standard precautions right now with

standard precautions right now with
standard<00:03:54.560> precautions<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.970> always<00:03:56.390> done<00:03:56.630> in

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
standard precautions is always done in

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.360 
standard precautions is always done in
congruent<00:03:57.470> with<00:03:57.620> other<00:03:57.769> types<00:03:58.190> of

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
congruent with other types of

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.240 
congruent with other types of
precautions<00:03:59.000> obviously<00:03:59.799> now<00:04:00.799> standard

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
precautions obviously now standard

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.460 
precautions obviously now standard
precautions<00:04:01.459> simply<00:04:02.239> are<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.600> basic<00:04:03.019> level

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
precautions simply are the basic level

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.860 
precautions simply are the basic level
of<00:04:03.620> infection<00:04:04.220> control<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.970> should<00:04:05.540> be<00:04:05.690> used

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
of infection control that should be used

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.220 
of infection control that should be used
in<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.200> care<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.500> all<00:04:06.590> patients<00:04:07.070> all<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.549> time

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.360 
in the care of all patients all the time
now<00:04:09.230> basically<00:04:09.470> we<00:04:09.920> use<00:04:10.070> standard

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
now basically we use standard

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.789 
now basically we use standard

to reduce the risk of transmission of

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.279 
to reduce the risk of transmission of
microorganisms<00:04:16.729> obviously<00:04:17.239> now<00:04:17.900> when<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.079> say

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
microorganisms obviously now when I say

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.089 
microorganisms obviously now when I say
standard<00:04:18.769> precaution<00:04:19.400> we<00:04:20.390> are<00:04:20.510> basically
