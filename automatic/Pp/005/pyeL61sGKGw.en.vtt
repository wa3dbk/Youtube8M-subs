00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.250
 while you see this report a 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.680
 animal is subjected to painful tests 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.439
 that cause irritation on the skin and 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.439
 eyes allergies genetic damage and cancer 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.610
 some that it's about injecting them 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 inoculate the animals 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.950
 substance that is impossible to reach 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 to the body of a live animal inject 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.730
 benzene intraperitoneally by 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 while cranial to see what happens 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.809
 recent studies indicate that more than 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 100 million vertebrate animals are 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.700
 used in research in the world 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.790
 every year the cosmetic industry has been 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.940
 the most indicated by its degree of cruelty 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 I consider that an animal that is in 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.850
 a laboratory of the cosmetic industry 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.729
 it's an animal torture because it's a 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 superficiality to be experiencing in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.119
 an animal when there may be 80 or 90 or 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 100 or 140 volunteers who are 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 pay 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.189
 that could be put in line for 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.259
 say to see put here with me here to see 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.630
 I feel it burns to see me 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.850
 eyes but you look at me like we do not have 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.219
 moral responsibility over animals 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.289
 to the cosmetics industries, 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.770
 they care to spoil their eyes 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.299
 a rabbit or a rooster 'john dog' this 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.969
 year the European Union banned the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.979
 mascara industry and lipstick 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.079
 experiment on animals and in spain 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.689
 canceled the possibility of using primates 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.119
 in all the tests in mexico the law 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.860
 aims to reduce pain fix the ways 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.929
 of drug administration and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.849
 way to kill them but the 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.179
 legislation is not respected and none 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.009
 authority oversees that this is good 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.110
 official standard comes divided into several 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.700
 chapters a few chapters are about 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 the facilities that you have to have for 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.959
 the animals according to the species 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.929
 handle small rodents rodents 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.549
 big rabbits dogs cats but not 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.319
 includes all species because 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.690
 experiments are also done in pigs 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.150
 on horses in ruminants and those are not 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.620
 contemplated in the official standard and is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.200
 demonstrated 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.490
 scientifically by neurophysiologists 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.080
 political scientists who 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.280
 many animals vertebrates 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.730
 they basically have a system 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.590
 central nervous system analogous to human 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.690
 which means that they have feelings 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.170
 like ours when they are 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.180
 stressed out they secrete cortisol 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.040
 and that all this is associated with 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.200
 sensations of stress pain of the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.239
 suffering finally say the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.520
 scholars that legislation and ethics 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.860
 go hand in hand for it they ask to stop 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.520
 use animals and replace them with new ones 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.520
 technologies
