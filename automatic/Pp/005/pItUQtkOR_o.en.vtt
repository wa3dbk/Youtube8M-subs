know that's a little too advanced for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.660 
know that's a little too advanced for
their<00:01:57.000> level<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.659> keep<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> simple<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.100> know

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
their level so keep it simple you know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.929 
their level so keep it simple you know
the<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.320> goal<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.399> them

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the the goal here is just to have them

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.780 
the the goal here is just to have them
categorize<00:02:03.810> things<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.070> learn

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
categorize things not you know learn

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.479 
categorize things not you know learn
what<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> mammal<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.800> third<00:02:11.099> strategy

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
what a mammal is the third strategy

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.820 
what a mammal is the third strategy
which<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.150> probably<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> cheapest<00:02:13.260> strategy

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
which is probably the cheapest strategy

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
which is probably the cheapest strategy
in<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> easiest<00:02:14.400> would<00:02:14.790> probably<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.390> buy

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
in the easiest would probably be to buy

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.020 
in the easiest would probably be to buy
a<00:02:15.540> box<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.470> Froot<00:02:16.800> Loops<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.460> know<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
a box of Froot Loops you know if you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.700 
a box of Froot Loops you know if you
have<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.210> class<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.900> Froot<00:02:19.110> Loops<00:02:19.140> will<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
have a class the Froot Loops will go a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.130 
have a class the Froot Loops will go a
long<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.460> buy<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.640> big<00:02:20.850> box<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
long way if you buy the big box and of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.720 
long way if you buy the big box and of
course<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> M&amp;Ms<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.580> them

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
course just like the M&amp;Ms have them

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.950 
course just like the M&amp;Ms have them
sorted<00:02:24.090> by<00:02:24.210> color<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.690> two<00:02:24.840> different

whole process you know Jane why did you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.750 
whole process you know Jane why did you
put<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.090> blue<00:02:37.100> Froot<00:02:38.100> Loops<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.580> this

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
put the blue Froot Loops in this

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.420 
put the blue Froot Loops in this
category<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.960> keep<00:02:40.800> asking<00:02:41.280> questions

category you know keep asking questions

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.030 
category you know keep asking questions
keep<00:02:42.030> getting<00:02:42.360> keeping<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.900> brain<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.830> is

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
keep getting keeping that brain going is

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.670 
keep getting keeping that brain going is
the<00:02:44.520> key<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.240> keep<00:02:45.960> them<00:02:46.140> keep<00:02:46.470> that

the key you know keep them keep that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.220 
the key you know keep them keep that
brain<00:02:46.890> stimulated<00:02:47.670> ask<00:02:48.120> any<00:02:48.510> questions<00:02:49.020> you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
brain stimulated ask any questions you

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380 
brain stimulated ask any questions you
know<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.800> child<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.430> course<00:02:51.120> questions

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
know to the child of course questions

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.740 
know to the child of course questions
that<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.840> child<00:02:52.080> will<00:02:52.290> understand<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.750> that's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that the child will understand so that's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
that the child will understand so that's
really<00:02:55.050> important

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.890 

the<00:02:59.130> last<00:02:59.400> suggestion<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.240> is<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the last suggestion that I have is that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.560 
the last suggestion that I have is that
you<00:03:01.410> could<00:03:01.830> buy<00:03:02.190> beats<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
you could buy beats and you can have a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.170 
you could buy beats and you can have a
child<00:03:03.810> sort<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> beads<00:03:05.090> into<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
child sort of the beads into the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.270 
child sort of the beads into the
different<00:03:06.480> categories<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.380> beads<00:03:07.830> are<00:03:08.040> great

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
different categories and beads are great

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.310 
different categories and beads are great
because<00:03:08.580> they<00:03:09.270> come<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.510> all<00:03:09.750> shapes<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
because they come in all shapes and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.740 
because they come in all shapes and
sizes<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.459> get<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.790> lot<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.180> beads<00:03:12.390> for

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
sizes and you can get a lot of beads for

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.600 
sizes and you can get a lot of beads for
pretty<00:03:13.590> cheap

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
pretty cheap

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.850 
pretty cheap
beads<00:03:15.360> are<00:03:15.660> also<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.260> good<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.650> work<00:03:16.830> with

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
beads are also really good to work with

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.440 
beads are also really good to work with
children<00:03:17.190> too<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:17.550> if<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.120> use<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
children too because if they use the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.690 
children too because if they use the
smaller<00:03:18.840> beads<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.860> helps<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.370> their<00:03:20.489> fine

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
smaller beads it helps with their fine

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.520 
smaller beads it helps with their fine
motor<00:03:20.730> skills<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.750> helps<00:03:21.780> them<00:03:22.110> strengthen

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
motor skills it helps them strengthen

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.900 
motor skills it helps them strengthen
the<00:03:22.650> little<00:03:22.890> muscles<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.370> their<00:03:23.489> fingers

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
the little muscles in their fingers

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.790 
the little muscles in their fingers
which<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.720> very<00:03:24.959> important<00:03:25.440> for<00:03:25.590> their

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
which is very important for their

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.520 
which is very important for their
development<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:27.300> would<00:03:28.140> definitely

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
development so I would definitely

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.170 
development so I would definitely
recommend<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.100> beads<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.760> beads<00:03:29.940> would

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
recommend the beads the beads would

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.320 
recommend the beads the beads would
probably<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.820> strategy<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.030> would

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
probably be the strategy that I would

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.979 
probably be the strategy that I would
use<00:03:34.550> remembering<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.090> use<00:03:36.570> any

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
use remembering that you can use any

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.009 
use remembering that you can use any
kind<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.470> manipulative<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.580> find

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
kind of manipulative that you can find

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
kind of manipulative that you can find
anything<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.470> can<00:03:40.709> be<00:03:40.830> grouped<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.550> it's

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
anything that can be grouped is it's

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.080 
anything that can be grouped is it's
really<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.989> really<00:03:43.560> good<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.190> know<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
really it's really good you know for the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.870 
really it's really good you know for the
child<00:03:45.360> anything<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.470> know<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.950> can<00:03:47.160> take<00:03:47.700> it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
child anything you know you can take it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.520 
child anything you know you can take it
into<00:03:48.120> everyday<00:03:48.480> life<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.620> know<00:03:51.080> money<00:03:52.080> for

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
into everyday life you know money for

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.850 
into everyday life you know money for
example<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.310> good<00:03:53.580> one<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.940> group<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.450> know

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
example is a good one to group you know

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.820 
example is a good one to group you know
anything<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.580> good<00:03:57.209> classroom<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:58.290> good<00:03:58.590> class

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
anything a good classroom a good class

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.050 
anything a good classroom a good class
in<00:03:59.130> class<00:04:00.800> strategy<00:04:01.800> would<00:04:01.980> be<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.459> have<00:04:02.790> all

you can use to get the child to
recognize<00:04:56.060> patterns<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:57.830> can<00:04:58.009> use<00:04:58.340> pattern

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
recognize patterns you can use pattern

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.059 
recognize patterns you can use pattern
cards<00:04:59.150> pattern<00:04:59.840> cards<00:05:00.139> are<00:05:00.289> great<00:05:00.409> you<00:05:00.949> can

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
cards pattern cards are great you can

are<00:05:08.659> always<00:05:08.900> simple<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.289> use<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:09.949> know<00:05:10.069> the

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
are always simple to use you know the

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.869 
are always simple to use you know the
kids<00:05:11.539> like<00:05:12.159> manipulatives<00:05:13.159> they<00:05:13.370> like<00:05:13.580> stuff

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
kids like manipulatives they like stuff

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.600 
kids like manipulatives they like stuff
they<00:05:14.030> can<00:05:14.210> hold<00:05:14.419> see<00:05:14.930> touch<00:05:15.319> fill<00:05:15.740> that<00:05:16.430> they

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
they can hold see touch fill that they

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.230 
they can hold see touch fill that they
like<00:05:16.819> that

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
like that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.360 
like that
so<00:05:17.360> pattern<00:05:17.690> cards<00:05:17.960> are<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.139> great<00:05:18.199> idea<00:05:19.009> you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
so pattern cards are a great idea you

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.290 
so pattern cards are a great idea you
can<00:05:20.180> also<00:05:20.360> use<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:21.009> once<00:05:22.009> again<00:05:22.280> beads<00:05:22.580> which<00:05:23.120> is

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
can also use a once again beads which is

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.820 
can also use a once again beads which is
my<00:05:23.479> favorite<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.139> would<00:05:24.319> definitely<00:05:24.440> use

you<00:05:34.490> know<00:05:34.610> on<00:05:34.909> the<00:05:35.509> string<00:05:35.870> for<00:05:36.860> this<00:05:37.130> though<00:05:37.610> I

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
you know on the string for this though I

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.790 
you know on the string for this though I
wouldn't<00:05:38.150> use<00:05:38.270> really<00:05:38.539> small<00:05:38.630> beads<00:05:39.409> because

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
wouldn't use really small beads because

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.409 
wouldn't use really small beads because
of<00:05:40.279> course<00:05:40.550> they're<00:05:40.880> still<00:05:41.000> trying<00:05:41.360> to

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
of course they're still trying to

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.870 
of course they're still trying to
develop<00:05:41.630> motor<00:05:42.199> skills<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.919> would<00:05:43.310> use<00:05:43.610> bigger

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
develop motor skills I would use bigger

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.649 
develop motor skills I would use bigger
beads<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:45.279> have<00:05:46.279> them<00:05:46.460> lace<00:05:46.639> them<00:05:46.909> on<00:05:47.150> a<00:05:47.419> piece

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
beads and have them lace them on a piece

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.620 
beads and have them lace them on a piece
of<00:05:47.690> yarn<00:05:48.050> with<00:05:48.830> or<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:49.789> can<00:05:49.849> have<00:05:50.090> like<00:05:50.449> the

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
of yarn with or you can have like the

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.749 
of yarn with or you can have like the
making<00:05:50.930> necklace<00:05:51.289> which<00:05:51.529> would<00:05:51.710> be<00:05:51.860> a<00:05:52.190> really

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
making necklace which would be a really

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.149 
making necklace which would be a really
good<00:05:52.880> idea<00:05:53.240> that<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.719> kids<00:05:53.900> would<00:05:54.139> love<00:05:54.319> so

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
good idea that the kids would love so

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:01.080 
good idea that the kids would love so
those<00:05:55.729> are<00:05:56.469> those<00:05:57.469> are<00:05:57.529> really<00:05:57.979> good<00:05:58.159> to<00:05:58.520> use

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.399 

another<00:06:02.090> idea<00:06:02.539> that<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.840> kids<00:06:02.960> will<00:06:03.199> really

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
another idea that the kids will really

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.330 
another idea that the kids will really
enjoy<00:06:03.889> is<00:06:04.870> have<00:06:05.870> them<00:06:06.080> repeat<00:06:06.650> a<00:06:06.710> pattern<00:06:07.159> in

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
enjoy is have them repeat a pattern in
