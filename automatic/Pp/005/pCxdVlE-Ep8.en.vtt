00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 they do not know how wonderful these are classes 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.390
 for you to make your own 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.940
 knitted shoes with heels with 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.099
 Espadrille style platform is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.019
 wonderful and everything is with a small 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.910
 hook and this kind of thread put 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.910
 a lot of attention are from the ico 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.520
 there are bases like these in heels or 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.610
 platform or short for one to choose 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.960
 do you want to knit if it is not for are 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.540
 which are colder as they are used 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.100
 plus the stamen for more hot to be the 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.860
 nylon thread that is what they use to 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.830
 Hammocks are very resistant to thick 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.210
 There are thin we can also use 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.860
 yarn is the fabric of the grandmothers 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.470
 because the basic points are needed 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.170
 How are medium points? 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.170
 slipped that's what we use 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.120
 there are platforms like this for a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.880
 booty or I presume this one or if you do 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.670
 heat is divine your own shoe 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.470
 custom woven and this has a 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.640
 advantage we are not activating our 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.010
 brain in our two hemispheres 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.550
 when we are knitting, it is not clear 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 remembering how many points we set 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.250
 we are also working our 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.250
 hands we are relaxing 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 good then mixtures of colors and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.930
 also different type of fabric for 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 have these textures clear that if 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.010
 it's there we can take advantage of the surplus 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 ticos that we have left of another shoe 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.220
 can make adjustments like these and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.870
 make your shoe a little more elegant and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.870
 here are what would be the buckles 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.609
 we are trying to make our shoe 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.580
 tissue I have to grab here truth me 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.680
 it went down 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.050
 after about an hour I have something 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.700
 obviously, obviously, if you take 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.730
 the class will do it faster and they will 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.390
 I assure you tennis can be done 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.150
 that you have to measure and count the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.490
 points so as not to lose the form 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.020
 this heel has already finished and is now in 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.820
 the second if I'm going to finish the pair 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.670
 complete for the unfinished in the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.710
 next great party here is the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.300
 model that we are doing here we are 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.090
 using yarn because we're going to do 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 some boots to inject ready now 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.150
 that comes in the rainy season in 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.680
 winter and many people are approaching 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.800
 ask you where you bought them and is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.610
 a father saying no I made them I made myself 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.730
 my shoes and something very important is me 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.680
 says how the fabric is going, not if it's too 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.910
 important because in total that we what 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.910
 we put and we do not have 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.890
 we are checking this is for a party 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.200
 then I could not dance if I stayed 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.750
 Loose exact and do not be afraid 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.100
 because they are very resistant threads and 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.870
 very durable and that we have left 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.750
 completely to the foot and it's never going to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.540
 sweat in 1 are not perfect depends on 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.230
 type of what we use is also the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.880
 hook that we should use see how it goes 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.180
 because this is almost over 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.180
 heel 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.370
 two models in two days that have to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.370
 take out a model and if you can 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.930
 best way to do brain gym 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.450
 weaving but the most important design 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.580
 your own custom shoes is 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.470
 incredible I say goodbye I'm tabata Jalil 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.970

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.420
 and there I go there I go I'm missing as 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.420
 programs
