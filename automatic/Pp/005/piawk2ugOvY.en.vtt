00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and if in humanitarian products he has 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.910
 two areas two areas of application 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.639
 main 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.460
 the first is for the shell scenarios 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.799
 sandals of the original brand of rock 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.360
 propose pink and so I believe the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.300
 I'm going to start with this video. 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.560
 you showing what is the application of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.970
 criteria for consolidation in China 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.869
 your window 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 it is basically composed of a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 surface without the highly 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.030
 resistant to any kind of envy 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 the recent steering wheel it already exists 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 all type of land that your client 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.620
 with pizarro was the state and a leaf of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.680
 role becomes, I'll explain to you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.410
 in detail because they were two 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.710
 two uses 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:02.160
 but really what our 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.589
 customers want the facility at a cost 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.659
 accessible with quality 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.030
 application in rubber to propose 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 Ozzy you are seeing that this is a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 white rubber 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 the rubber before you apply it on your 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 ideas in this little demo here 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.270
 I 'm not going to show you the cleaning. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 that I did but the only thing I did 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 was with a tax always make a 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.960
 cleaning before you applied on 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 techniques on the board because any type 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.770
 when it leaves the mold, it comes out 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.079
 with the amounts more like a scene 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.430
 a grease not to stick to the mold 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.619
 then came from the manufacturer to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 you mean some successes, yes then 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.850
 you get some water was passes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 with a clean cloth also the plate that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.210
 you will avoid most of the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.229
 problems 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.170
 the first thing we'll do 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.000
 up to over ten siblings and get over texas 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 sun is cut in sheet 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.460
 we offer him both rolled into 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.079
 coils and sheets 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.850
 the leaves we provide them in the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.850
 width three in the amateur the door 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.380
 we will first apply the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 disappearance of ex-girlfriend porous rock 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.320
 minimum application of 160 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.570
 degrees then from 160 degrees you 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.100
 You can already put your words to me 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.630
 I recommend this commented doing a 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.700
 demonstration so far as you can 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.950
 see the temperature a little bit to what I'm going 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.260
 make the bonding the sublimation a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.050
 demonstration would not take too long to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.270
 People are waiting for the temperature to drop 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.740
 then she goes up again and I'll stick on a 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.520
 temperature something like this but the temperature 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.980
 Correct takeoff of the plate is 160 degrees 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.070
 not much more than that does not mean 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:51.130
 a cookie will suffer two applications 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:03:01.060
 of the first heat is to regulate 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:07.960
 personal applied military presence now 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.550
 After that, I'll cut you a plate 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.280
 already cut 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.960
 this exchange we cut here a 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.140
 machine that we have 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.820
 we made the cut you can repair the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.740
 Finishing she was perfect she did not 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.570
 have no trouble so much import 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.570
 on top of how much to cut down 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.940
 moreover, the personnel who have a 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.340
 only one person was cut underneath 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
 some kind of difficulty is feasible and 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.970
 blind 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.140
 use two or three sheets of newspaper do not 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.700
 forget to put a sheet of paper 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.530
 sulphite when you find other 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720
 five great possibilities 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.550
 It will take everything from any kind of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.380
 There's no problem over there. 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.450
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.430
 will not be any problem then the 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.959
 We already have people talking here or 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.800
 tight slippers called square 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.800
 We'll get the slipper. 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.020
 Let's get an impression that is the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:12.760
 first here in this company 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:14.830
 printer here at that time the role 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.070
 we used it is a detail that I go 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.750
 is a sulphite paper like our 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.580
 distributors comes with the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.300
 your image but I recommend you guys 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.460
 always test before you buy 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.770
 the entity there are dramatic roles that 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.060
 are compatible, there are roles 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.009
 which are not compatible 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.539
 of course use the paper 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.669
 normal as the other powers 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.870
 technical advantages but in certain cases 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.509
 it does not work well 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.310
 so come on let's just do this 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.530
 affirmation the sublimation 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.229
 it can be done so much the staff 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.520
 As an end angel, I'll do it here with 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.509
 you january 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.280
 It was not perfect because neither 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.560
 all the burden of difference 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.000
 So when you buy sodexo 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.729
 worry the first to second 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.680
 print is a tv for you 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.360
 adjusted seasonally adjusted 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.669
 No problem, nothing else. 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.199
 with a temperature slightly at 221 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.449
 Points a long time ago I 'm going to stop more 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.050
 or less than 20 seconds from the person 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.940
 appeared will only reach the eyes at 25 to 30 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.300
 seconds that I recommend to 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.349
 temperature and time of sublimation of 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.159
 transfer 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:30.779
 The staff here are pulling you out. 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.090
 give a change even this is 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.889
 our product is already 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.050
 designed for this not to give 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.659
 no ghost type or no type 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:48.080
 problem at print time 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:51.870
 so it holds even printed paper 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.990
 sublimated bright colors 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.120
 highlight color changes 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.639
 no type of defect totally 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.629
 finished 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.960
 this is about the coach of the china 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.960
 folks
