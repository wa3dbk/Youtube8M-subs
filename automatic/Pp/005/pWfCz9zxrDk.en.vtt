00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.350
 collectors welten yes as promised 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
 There are several lego sets in this time 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.740
 as well as today 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.320
 I already have the big bang theory 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.920
 lego set open and now I have 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 seen 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.210
 this cool headset 21 19 21 19 10 11 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.240
 9 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.390
 oh whatever 21 11 9 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.340
 the cave of lego minecraft is Steve 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 The zombie does it twice 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 a small spoiler is here in the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.719
 principle of each of the minecraft times played 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 should know it 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.510
 the set costs 20 euro in the store I found 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.050
 i think scared cheapest lego 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 minecraft is a capital stock bought 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.129
 I'll open this one with this one 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 Impressions for you totally shit that was 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.090
 much much at the big bang theory cents 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.090
 better one comes to open the Beginning 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.619
 not really going on again 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.619
 also different 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:20.610
 and come on break and we open it 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.679
 Let's see what's in there and then 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 I will not build in front of the camera 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.860
 that always takes way too long 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 which also stupid when I first made 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.869
 I do not want to break it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.869
 but oh, really right 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.869
 OK 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.660
 that everything is okay once a huge one 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.420
 two huge bags and a plate 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.870
 bit and the guide of course me 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.520
 I would say but need it too 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.290
 when will we see you again soon? 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.960
 right here it is ready 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.030
 yes you can rebuild that was somehow 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.000
 again , a bit of what breaks down here 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920
 from the sandberg you can get one 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.840
 ladder so a staircase in principle 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 Although build down have a guide 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.440
 I did not do it now 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.110
 still here the bonner I know 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.489
 I but that here looks so good that one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.830
 mini zombie third sees itself turn 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.540
 So about two mini to the coach 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.720
 rotating in this spot as sustained 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.989
 Furthermore, one can still here 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.660
 fold down 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.380
 then the zombie disappears or dives 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.320
 just keep it nice for 20 euros 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.030
 You can do that shopping link 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.739
 is also in the video description if 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.120
 I do not forget I went constantly 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.080
 now my plants and then we see 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.130
 us again at the next purchase or 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.260
 possibly synonymous with boosters times 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.260
 again until next time bye
