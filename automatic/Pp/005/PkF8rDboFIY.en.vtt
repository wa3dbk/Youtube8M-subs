00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.520
 I see 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:59.640
 I found not because it does not have to be 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.460
 from scratch or nothing because that's how you know the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.390
 elite since it's made for a woman 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 Of temperature 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.890
 good 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.990
 the credit is like this you put the food for 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.990
 here 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.500
 and has a camera that when they jump 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.120
 food 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.519
 as a goal 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.519
 so that it is cool now up here 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.269
 because here 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.890
 and that is so 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.420
 it's like that 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.660
 and then you put here so that 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.760
 I really am 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.750
 well I do not think the project melts 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.750
 in these microwaves 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.459
 and how is it made for small 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.459
 temperatures 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.490
 you have to realize that the tapas 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.500
 these metal caps that are 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.650
 closed because we are not cooking well 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.599

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.420
 now I'm going to teach in the oven 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.090
 turned on so they see well 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.069
 now I'm going to close the blinds and everything 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.069
 to see the light and everything 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.410
 own 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.209
 I'm going to light the oven just 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.260
 days that he pressed on no button nor 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:23.109
 nothing because nothing else you connect to the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.109
 kitchen and good there 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.800
 after leaving warm for 15 minutes 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.650
 and there is the throne on which he leaves 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.650
 many gentlemen 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.850
