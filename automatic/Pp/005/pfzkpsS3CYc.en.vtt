 he catch the enemy t-43

 the next shot again performed 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.409
 amx-13 f3 artillery and im one of 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.450
 most dangerous among tier 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.490
 artillery in pvp mode and this time 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.649

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.069
 German arte di fifth level seemed 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.110
 would be an insurmountable obstacle in the form 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.080
 buildings but our hero 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.420
 it's not a hindrance even the cars and a pile of coal is not 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.420
 prevented an incredibly accurate shot 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.920
 in fourth place stock ISU-152 with 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.720

 and in the first place we have a player with obvious 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.650
 extrasensory abilities seemed 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.540

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.519
