00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.910
 Both dreams come true today with more 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.920
 an instructor tutorial where you are super 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.890
 easy to do very very very easy 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.140
 here this window is still people 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.529
 I love tim burton film I 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 I love to realize that pain, since 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.180
 Because of my purse, it 's not so I made this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 qaraqie is super super easy to do 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.599
 so if you want to see how I did 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.160
 This bastard resolves with me as 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 showed money to you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 so you're going to need a mug 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.120
 because we're going to put 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.739
 oven and a permanent pen 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 the first thing I did before 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.399
 start clearing any mug with a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.079
 cotton with alcohol 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 You can pick us up, but whatever. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.899
 It's always good to clean it up before 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 to start 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.280
 then I took a pencil and did more or 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230
 less an outline of the drawing I wanted 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.329
 to do that was the face of the check 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.460
 after I made a sketch then I 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.840
 I started with the pen, the cool thing is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.619
 while the planet has been wet before 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.420
 You put it in the oven and it's you. 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 can erase and redo as many times as 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 You want to use a little 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.439
 alcohol then do there with a well 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.939
 and if there is anything it is only 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.549
 delete and redo 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.590
 so I was just filling in the drawing 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.750
 with the pen I'm using this pen 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 those to mark those cd's 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.490
 because it uses only 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.670
 decoration so I'm using this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.590
 after you've done all your drawing 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 that she's cute the way you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.939
 want you already did and did what you want 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.780
 Then we'll put it in the oven for more 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.490
 or less than 30 to 50 minutes and then after 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.939
 This time your mug will be 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.939
 ready 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.060
 So we've been doing it, so do not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.920
 I voted in the oven to leave more or less 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.960
 there are many because I forgot too 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.049
 Actually speaking I leave 30 months that 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.100
 50 put in the pantry and I left much less 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.079
 50 minutes she stayed so I had to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.210
 do one more soon after I came back 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.789
 the first year because I do not know if 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.649
 You guys, she gave a little break but 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.789
 I really liked the result today. 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.130
 It was really cool. 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.230
 of course how I used the pen 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.680
 she will not command and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.840
 ability as good as the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.760
 own porcelain but how will I use it 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.549
 then decor years thought not 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.940
 Set up the real in a 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.580
 pen to use only once type now 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.980
 I have the mugs and I used the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.140
 decor so if you want to do 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.269
 from the heart you can use treatment 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.790
 complete them to yield even in the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.069
 little box is not so zane, everything else 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.650
 so this same one 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.630
 is she gonna love you less durability 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.549
 but he was an actor at heart I think it's worth 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.599
 Too bad you will not be washing 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.190
 always straight rubbing and maximum 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.140
 Are you going to take it out? 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.170
 Western decor you can buy 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.630
 the permanent pen even if you can 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.400
 wear it good now if you want one thing 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.060
 What are you going to wear? Will you be there? 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 sleep everything more then I indicate 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.980
 buy up the own porcelain 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.680
 it comes off a bit more expensive but of course 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.290
 durability it is much 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.600
 who votes in the oven or will not leave 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.560
 This one is going to last but it's not that long. 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.180
 so that's why I say 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.760
 the permanent collection only if you are 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.739
 wearing my underwear for decoration is not mine 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.650
 based on the decoration so I used the 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.780
 permanent I liked think in 12 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.660
 bit on the planet and were by now 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.700
 five or six reais in cash then your 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.800
 Well, well, things have changed. I like it a lot. 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.840
 because I have a mug in my face 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.560
 Mother falling in the corner one thing I 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.780
 taste and know cheapie so that hey 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.640
 Let's go through the favela, I hope 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.590
 Did you like that you spend there? 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.120
 Of course you choose to use this idea. 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.739
 to make any other type of background 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.930
 it's as if the pretty ones and phrases can 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.459
 do one thing that is obvious with book 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.140
 a series you like 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.120
 you can use creativity by doing 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.459
 You want to use a pen to 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.950
 keep that body waiting for anyone to leave 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.049
 you want and not forgetting how 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.819
 do things in the pens you want 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.940
 one thing to use that lasts more so 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.250
 with a testing planet providing 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.500
 this is some store that has not been expressed 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.370
 zanatti you will find ask there 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.040
 they have that try to ask the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.750
 porcelain that I decided to show but 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.470
 you can put the permanent pen 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.510
 on stationery same as I did that was 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.010
 The result I loved my colleague 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.660
 has arrived 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.000

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.760
 You guys do it tomorrow, we meet people.

 has no power to put any mug 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.870
 Like if you do it to me, it's you. 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.090

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.590
