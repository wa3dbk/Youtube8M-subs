00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
case especially the weekend was

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.799 
case especially the weekend was
difficult<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.390> pretty<00:00:45.629> much

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
difficult you know it was pretty much

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.229 
difficult you know it was pretty much
America<00:00:46.379> against<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> played<00:00:48.090> with

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
America against me because I played with

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
America against me because I played with
jordan<00:00:48.629> Spieth<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.899> obviously<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> he<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
jordan Spieth and obviously the he had a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.880 
jordan Spieth and obviously the he had a
few<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.340> offense<00:00:50.579> than<00:00:50.760> me<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> therefore

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
few more offense than me so therefore

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.380 
few more offense than me so therefore
even<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.250> satisfying<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
even more satisfying you know that I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.420 
even more satisfying you know that I
went<00:00:54.600> through<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.250> whole

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
went through all that and the whole

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
went through all that and the whole
battle<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.719> only<00:00:57.870> Craig<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.410> me

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
pretty much it was better we could pull

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.290

that<00:02:03.570> pressure<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.409> work<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.740> things

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that pressure and go and work on things

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
that pressure and go and work on things
in<00:02:05.399> your<00:02:05.579> own<00:02:05.640> space<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.420> own<00:02:06.540> time<00:02:06.750> away

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
in your own space in your own time away

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.940 
in your own space in your own time away
from<00:02:07.399> tournaments<00:02:09.170> no<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
from tournaments no and there was a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
from tournaments no and there was a
problem<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.690> was<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.230> difficult
