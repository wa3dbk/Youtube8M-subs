in<00:01:18.140> while<00:01:19.140> blending<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.910> all

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
in while blending you are not at all

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.930 
in while blending you are not at all
supposed<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:21.750> add<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> lot<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> water<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
supposed to add a lot of water if you

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.040 
supposed to add a lot of water if you
add<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.610> impossible<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
add it is very impossible to make a

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.980 
add it is very impossible to make a
perfectly<00:01:28.950> shaped<00:01:28.979> wadis<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
perfectly shaped wadis because the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.030 
perfectly shaped wadis because the
batter<00:01:31.290> would<00:01:31.740> become<00:01:32.250> very<00:01:32.720> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.900> thin<00:01:34.320> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
batter would become very kind of thin so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.609 
batter would become very kind of thin so
make<00:01:35.280> sure<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:36.030> adding<00:01:36.630> water<00:01:37.140> very

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
make sure you are adding water very

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.550 
make sure you are adding water very
little<00:01:38.040> by<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.180> avoid<00:01:39.960> jamming

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
little by little just to avoid jamming

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.370 
little by little just to avoid jamming
of<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.950> blender<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.640> bed<00:01:41.910> grinder<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:43.020> not

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
of your blender or bed grinder but not

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.160 
of your blender or bed grinder but not
more<00:01:43.830> than<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.600> my<00:01:45.960> wet

grinder to blanket and here is the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.510 
grinder to blanket and here is the
preferred<00:01:50.790> crowd<00:01:51.600> batter<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.650> this<00:01:52.980> is<00:01:53.159> how

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
preferred crowd batter and this is how

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.700 
preferred crowd batter and this is how
it<00:01:53.790> looks

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
it looks

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.250 
it looks
see<00:01:54.830> how<00:01:55.040> thick<00:01:55.370> it<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.640> now<00:01:56.510> I'm<00:01:56.660> just<00:01:56.840> going

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
see how thick it is now I'm just going

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.000 
see how thick it is now I'm just going
to<00:01:57.290> add

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
to add

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.240

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
this to make it even more thick and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.040 
this to make it even more thick and
since<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.070> used<00:02:07.430> wet<00:02:07.790> grinder<00:02:08.300> there<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.810> no

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
since I used wet grinder there is no

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.790 
since I used wet grinder there is no
problem<00:02:09.649> but<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.310> used<00:02:11.080> blender<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.380> blank
