00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello friends with you Maracas 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.330
 Today I would like to show you the boykina and 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.990
 70 tons on the airfield map 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.030
 I play in the platoon myself third and side 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.180
 4502 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.340
 principle in platoon we have and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.369
 a real heavy tank that can 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.789
 carry many restaurants of this story 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 and another fast tank which is 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.800
 principle also has a good 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.380
 durability and fast damager which is not 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.210
 loves when he shoots this Anna 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.090
 promotions so really need a neat 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.510
 play on this tank because 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.890
 completely unable to bear blows 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.989
 fate and if he shoots at him quickly 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.079
 falling apart here I saw 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 indian-panzer well but unfortunately could not 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.270
 him get there because i panther 2 for 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 blocked the view but then I drive 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.970
 a little further because it is from this 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:22.140
 Balcony can be shot center 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.750
 often enemies are simply insolently trying 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 to drive 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 but in this case there is almost no one here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.560
 q &amp; a everyone and a good overview and if anyone 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 then there would be him one hundred percent 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.110
 would light up even for this reason green 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.810
 circle of the scene reviews you can see that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.790
 I'm almost to the base can light the enemy well, 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.560
 from see 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:58.330
 40 give four and houses board and she me 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.320
 flashes because after the shot 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.190
 bushes disappear for a while me 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 have to drive back a little to 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.060
 From the base of the enemy, do not throw anyone 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 but I see one thing that opponents 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.550
 give water this is one of the biggest 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.680
 the mistakes that enemies make 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.100
 because there is absolutely no pressure from the water 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 no point in the first place 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.810
 perfectly fired arta even 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.920
 despite the fact that there is no art in this fight 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.330
 anyway there is very dangerous because 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.430
 here from our country where we stand 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.950
 from there, shoot absolutely all 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.690
 water you can see that we can 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.600
 shoot them very well that is in 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.280
 all areas here they will go to our 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.670
 bases and everywhere we can get them well here 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.310
 is already leaving super pershing extremely 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.090
 uncomfortable goal honored any tank 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:13.200
 because super pershing is strong 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:18.519
 frontal armor trying to break at15 but 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.340
 Here you saw the rebound 2 and therefore 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.269
 switching off to a softer target is 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.750
 a tiger that rides a board 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.260
 that is, I advise all the same in the first 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.390
 turn 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.170
 eliminate enemies that are easiest 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.690
 easiest to break through 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.480
 and which is most substituted 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.629
 at15 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.360
 pretty strong target and here I am already 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.170
 I shoot at isu because now he 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.200
 it can be easily substituted 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.230
 throw and fast we rush 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.970
 parse as you can see rashit 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:05.750
 water is not worth it and you need to remember it 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.579
 but you must still at least 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.890
 one two tanks here 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:15.230
 or here to leave in order to 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.000
 if there is such a holder because 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.520
 what if all well our allies would be from 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.680
 values on the enemy in which here 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.130
 were labor maybe this time would 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.639
 drove to our base and stopped by drove to 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.740
 us in the rear and it would be extremely bad 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:38.120
 here I see t28 alpha slippers 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.300
 played a little sloppy here 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.560
 substituted too long standing and this 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.130
 of course led his plum well here 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.060
 great t28 makes the tower where easy 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.760
 you can edit and in principle just in 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.280
 the forehead of the tower is well sewn can this too 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.729
 for myself 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.510
 notice that is if you see t28 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.960
 prototype then shoot him a tower much 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.100
 easier 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.380
 punch there than the body 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:21.949
 a little bit here not very accurately shot and 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:24.780
 Of course this t28 need 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.080
 focus if it is put overboard 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.750
 because some cases the truth 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.539
 it is very difficult to break through this rubbish but here 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.099
 I see already in the back of David the enemies are trying 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.479
 destroy us our isa third 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:48.210
 who complain about lags and what 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:50.910
 him there are problems with the internet and here's how 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.389
 I act again looking around 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:59.130
 so as not to come under fire even now 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.050
 not really I wanted to travel to t29 but so 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.849
 how should I finish it all the same it 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.889
 I do not care anymore 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.240
 Isa the third to the same here still this 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:14.550
 puts together they could inflict me 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.270
 for example day 700 damage if they had 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:22.289
 you give them good damage but here's the type 59 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.020
 not very experienced stands still I him 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:29.430
 put on a caterpillar that is shoot 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:34.380
 front rink and while he stood with could him 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:37.440
 still throwing I understand that you can still him 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.840
 throw that is i can have time 1 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.250
 at home 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.889
 since it doesn't really have a game library easy 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.040
 I will sort it out and besides them opel me 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:55.540
 will you 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:58.390
 although of course on fcm you need all the enemies 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:02.680
 how to be afraid even 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:07.720
 sixth level because we have armor 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:14.000
 almost no and either hit it 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:16.370
 almost one hundred percent damage panel but here 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.870
 I get of course the mask does not break 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:26.660
 t28 of course already get my here and 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:30.350
 this fight is over thanks for 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:33.410
 view write your comments want 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.100
 do you still have such fights on me and everything 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.580
 such fights 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:42.790
 a lot of need every third fight then 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.790
 way in general good luck and bye
