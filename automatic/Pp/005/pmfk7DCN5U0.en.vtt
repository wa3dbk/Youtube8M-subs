adapter this goes plugged into the card

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.530 
adapter this goes plugged into the card
then<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.410> plug<00:00:43.650> either<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> s-video<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
then you plug either the s-video or the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.290 
then you plug either the s-video or the
composite<00:00:46.230> video<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:47.040> into<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.519> also

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

included is a DVI to VGA adapter some

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.770 
included is a DVI to VGA adapter some
software<00:00:51.960> drivers<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.670> manual<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.330> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
software drivers and the manual and the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.410 
software drivers and the manual and the
card<00:00:55.019> there<00:00:55.979> are<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.339> different<00:00:56.790> cards<00:00:57.120> here

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
card there are two different cards here

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.829 
card there are two different cards here
however<00:00:58.019> they<00:00:58.379> are<00:00:58.409> identical<00:00:59.339> in

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
however they are identical in

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.570 
however they are identical in
performance<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.470> only<00:01:01.799> difference<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
performance the only difference is that

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.780 
performance the only difference is that
this<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.479> version<00:01:03.930> 1.0<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.370> one<00:01:05.610> is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
this one is version 1.0 and this one is

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.020 
this one is version 1.0 and this one is
version<00:01:06.630> 1.1<00:01:07.440> as<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.370> there<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
version 1.1 as you can see there is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
version 1.1 as you can see there is
certainly<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.540> color<00:01:09.930> difference<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
certainly a color difference on a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
certainly a color difference on a
printed<00:01:11.070> circuit<00:01:11.100> board<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:12.119> first<00:01:12.540> things

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
printed circuit board one first things

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
printed circuit board one first things
that<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.260> notice<00:01:13.500> about<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.979> card<00:01:14.250> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that you will notice about this card is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940 
that you will notice about this card is
the<00:01:14.520> odd-looking<00:01:14.700> cooling<00:01:15.630> system<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.500> called

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the odd-looking cooling system is called

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.050 
the odd-looking cooling system is called
the<00:01:17.340> outside<00:01:17.909> thermal<00:01:18.690> exhaust<00:01:19.110> system<00:01:20.060> p/es

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the outside thermal exhaust system p/es

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
the outside thermal exhaust system p/es
and<00:01:21.960> let<00:01:22.080> me<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.409> through<00:01:22.439> exactly

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and let me just go through exactly

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
and let me just go through exactly
what's<00:01:23.430> included<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> actually

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
what's included with how it actually

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
what's included with how it actually
works<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.770> first<00:01:25.979> let's<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.329> area

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
works but first let's look at this area

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.779 
works but first let's look at this area
of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.229> card<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> will

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
of the card you can see that it will

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.060 
of the card you can see that it will
take<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.329> two<00:01:30.840> slots<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.649> back<00:01:31.829> here

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
take up two slots in the back here

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.310 
take up two slots in the back here
computer<00:01:32.520> system<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.929> is<00:01:34.109> where

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
computer system and right here is where

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.980 
computer system and right here is where
it<00:01:34.439> ports<00:01:34.859> all<00:01:35.039> hot<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.479> TV<00:01:36.719> out

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it ports all hot here here is the TV out

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.039 
it ports all hot here here is the TV out
the<00:01:37.409> VGA<00:01:37.859> connection<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.579> well<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> DVI

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the VGA connection as well as the DVI

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.709 
the VGA connection as well as the DVI
connection<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.890> remember<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.579> card<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.450> do

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
connection and remember this card can do

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.139 
connection and remember this card can do
dual<00:01:43.289> display<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.789> cooling

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
dual display now back to the cooling

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.749 
dual display now back to the cooling
system<00:01:45.539> right<00:01:45.719> here<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.109> where<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.289> those

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
system right here is where all those

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
system right here is where all those
copper<00:01:47.759> fins<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.630> located<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.710> are

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
copper fins are located they are

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580 
copper fins are located they are
connected<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> conductive<00:01:51.630> base<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.229> they

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
connected to a conductive base and they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310 
connected to a conductive base and they
are<00:01:52.740> also<00:01:52.950> connected<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.909> heat<00:01:54.479> pipe<00:01:54.780> which

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
are also connected to a heat pipe which

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
are also connected to a heat pipe which
in<00:01:55.530> turn<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.009> connected<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.909> conductive

in turn is connected to that conductive

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.929 
in turn is connected to that conductive
base<00:01:58.079> then<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.859> connected<00:01:59.340> phase<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.759> course

card right here is a plastic cover which
houses<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.170> fan<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.369> center<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
houses a fan in the center this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110 
houses a fan in the center this
basically<00:02:09.720> intakes<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.800> air<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.310> exhausted

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
basically intakes the air and exhausted

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.450 
basically intakes the air and exhausted
right<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> back<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.100> fan<00:02:14.370> spins<00:02:14.790> at

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
right of the back now this fan spins at
