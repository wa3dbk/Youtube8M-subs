anyway<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> shave<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> off<00:01:45.299> after<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
anyway you got to shave it off after you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.980 
anyway you got to shave it off after you
cut<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.710> model<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.280> proof<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.119> that's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
cut the model off this proof so that's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.539 
cut the model off this proof so that's
all<00:01:49.170> people<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.619> say<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:50.220> got<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
all people can say they got so

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
all people can say they got so
aggravating<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.570> I've<00:01:51.750> decided<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
aggravating that now I've decided I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.600 
aggravating that now I've decided I
didn't<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.649> they'd<00:01:52.710> look<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.040> bad<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
didn't think they'd look that bad but I

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.359 
didn't think they'd look that bad but I
guess<00:01:53.880> everybody<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:54.930> them<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
guess everybody could see them so if you

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
guess everybody could see them so if you
are<00:01:56.549> looking<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.909> paint<00:01:57.560> models<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.710> are

something<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.770> glue<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.490> makes<00:04:27.790> it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
something and this glue just makes it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.000 
something and this glue just makes it
easier<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.840> little<00:04:29.170> tiny<00:04:29.320> bit<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.680> glue<00:04:29.800> a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
easier I use a little tiny bit of glue a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.580 
easier I use a little tiny bit of glue a
little<00:04:30.880> goes<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.030> long<00:04:31.120> way<00:04:31.480> put<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.440> together

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
little goes a long way put it together

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.620 
little goes a long way put it together
it<00:04:32.950> dries<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.550> matter<00:04:33.730> of<00:04:33.790> seconds<00:04:36.630> while

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
it dries in a matter of seconds while

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.600 
it dries in a matter of seconds while
that's<00:04:37.840> drying<00:04:38.020> up<00:04:38.350> Lou<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.980> legs<00:04:39.190> down<00:04:39.400> to

that's drying up Lou the legs down to

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.180 
that's drying up Lou the legs down to
this<00:04:39.670> base<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.150> will<00:04:40.630> not<00:04:40.870> keep<00:04:41.470> these<00:04:41.740> plastic
