00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
of the atrophied calf muscle is there's

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.820 
of the atrophied calf muscle is there's
more<00:00:12.389> functional<00:00:12.900> movements<00:00:13.200> such<00:00:13.799> as

strengthen<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.170> Tribute<00:00:22.560> cab<00:00:22.769> muscle<00:00:23.220> just

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
strengthen that Tribute cab muscle just

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.490 
strengthen that Tribute cab muscle just
because<00:00:23.970> walking<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> most

cab muscle are exercises going to help

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
cab muscle are exercises going to help
increase<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> range<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> motion<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
increase the range of the motion of the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
increase the range of the motion of the
foot<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.210> turn<00:01:09.240> strengthen<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
foot which will in turn strengthen the

foot which will in turn strengthen the
cab<00:01:10.229> muscles<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.340> surrounding

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
cab muscles and the surrounding

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
cab muscles and the surrounding
musculature<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.560> exercise<00:01:13.920> I'll<00:01:14.100> show

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
musculature the first exercise I'll show
you<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.180> band<00:01:15.450> exercise<00:01:15.810> just

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you you're just more band exercise just

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
you you're just more band exercise just
because<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.409> want<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> minimize<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.400> stress

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
because it's want to minimize the stress

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.770 
because it's want to minimize the stress
of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> actual<00:01:19.229> cab<00:01:19.470> muscle<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.570> just

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
of the actual cab muscle you can just

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.149 
of the actual cab muscle you can just
put<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> band<00:01:22.200> around<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.890> ball<00:01:23.070> of
