00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello today I wanted to talk about the clinic 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.450
 lances mascara the whole product 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 contains 7 milliliters instead of mine 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 sample and contains only 5 lo 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.000
 pipe cleaner you made in silicone and one 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 very particular shape 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.519
 the structure of the brush is narrow and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.650
 a little curved has only three lines 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.080
 small teeth about 3 mm each 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.660
 as you see my natural eyelashes are 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.660
 dead straight to thin and scattered court 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.520
 I really appreciate the fact that this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.300
 mascaro I give myself a nice volume and for me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.300
 this is very important 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 after a few attempts the application of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.460
 mascara becomes very easy on the ride 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 lower and above all allows us to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 reach reason a little more critical 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.800
 like the ends of the eyes but that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 which struck me most is the fact that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.400
 these pipe cleaner manages to get to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 eyelash roots 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.820
 this particularity is not for everyone 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.979
 mascara 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.860
 the result is that the roots seem 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.110
 bigger and therefore more shapely and so 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.850
 more intense look thanks also to the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.850
 color added to the base of the lashes 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.940
 this mascara does not create citrus fruits and le 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.370
 eyelashes remain is always soft 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.710
 it almost seems like they are fed and at 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.420
 evening it is very easy to remove make-up and there is not 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.340
 need a specific product that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.140
 that I did not like so much and the al 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.620
 mascara states and talk a lot about 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140
 eyelashes 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.270
 but I honestly find it average 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.590
 from this point of view simply 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 I was expecting a little more 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.000
 I find that eyelashes are not well spoken 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.090
 since the formula tends to color the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 a bit at the beginning it is particularly 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.970
 challenging to get used to the structure 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.100
 some pipe cleaners get dirty easily 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.520
 if you want to reach the base of 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.459
 eyelashes 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.459
 but these can be remedied with a cotton 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.060
 fioc after waiting for the mascara 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.060
 6 closes well 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.269
 my vote and 7 out of 10 this is a good one 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.079
 I've tried better but also mascara 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 much worse 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:35.540
 as you will see in the next ones 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.689
 review thanks for your attention to 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.689
 next one
