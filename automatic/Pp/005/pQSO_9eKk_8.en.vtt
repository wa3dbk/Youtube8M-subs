00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.000
 two 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 and now 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.100
 and let's check this well what 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.080
 first that I have changed the map 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.000
 I created this map , I am from a 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.710
 old server that had to really 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.119
 think that the map had lost it but 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.660
 the found and good the finish of 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 do because they usually had a couple of 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 plots made of vital 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.330
 Well the first thing we're going to see are the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.950
 new plugins so life really 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.630
 for plugins and you can see that there are 56 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 plugins 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.090
 in these moments previously they had 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.860
 much less in version 1.6 point 2 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.630
 I think there were 39 or something like that and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.670
 now we are 56 so we have 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.670
 updated to 1.6 point 4 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.270
 well that's better then in this case 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.430
 Well, everything is set 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.629
 everything is fine everything works there is no 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.890
 no kind of problems we have 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.890
 updated perfectly 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.390
 and you're going to enjoy the map and 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.260
 our new on the server every time 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.720
 that I put a good map a new pack 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.970
 of plugins in download you os what 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 you can download and configure it in 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.720
 five minute matter 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.260
 even taken less really really slow 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.920
 it seems to me that 15 seconds after 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.970
 leave us 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.500
 nothing has been a second and well I will 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.000
 design the new map that you left 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.040
 download for servers that is a 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.820
 map that basically what you have is a 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.430
 Spanish a very very shabby Spanish and I've 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.070
 thought that this here, well, what 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.049
 I leave to you to decorate and all that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.580
 help below it could be a jail and 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.530
 here are some plots as well as more 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.479
 big around spam that could 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.759
 be good town hall shops what 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 you want and we teach you and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.920
 changing and how large map 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.289
 Normally if you look at the mini map 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.750
 which is what appears in the part 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.420
 upper right is huge 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.879
 I will try to run but right now 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.780
 I'm less beaten by you sing and girls 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.180
 that running in 1 as you can check 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.920
 little one is not there are very many plots 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.750
 really 9 calculated but 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.750
 there are approximately 16 x 16 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.220
 and the plots are also 16 x 16 or 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.220
 they are quite large games 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.630
 we can check this no time 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.240
 the plot is 16 x 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.510
 16 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.190
 and the map 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.590
 in which I have created 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.690
 very much with the compass almost faster than the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.910
 pick this corner here 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.910
 if I'm going to go in another corner 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.810
 by the way all the plugins that you have 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.610
 seen from some points 6.4 well then 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.079
 it's 343 by 343 wide and the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.110
 multiplication of plots because 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.480
 let's do right now 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.690
 they put it on the screen because now 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.940
 same I am with the mobile 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.980
 and you can not see but soon the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.980
 parcels are bikes for 16 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.360
 are the 256 plots in total in 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.700
 this mini map 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.370
 well you can see on my map that you see 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.840
 lots of plots really never anything 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.090
 simply built is the design 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.090
 basic and that's it, it's all like that 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.700
 we can give you the decoration that 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.250
 you want and all that because of that there is no 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.000
 kind of problem I left you this 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.080
 so for good the most beginners 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.690
 they can have a server with their 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.790
 16 x 16 games and they can put them 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.560
 the doors types of things 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.989
 good and to yourselves and the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.450
 decoration you want and all that and this 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.680
 from here the godmothers 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.120
 I have put it because here all 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.470
 We are the goal of those who are coming 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.050
 included when you download the server 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.420
 and if you build buildings here in the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.580
 These plots are larger 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.470
 the goals can not leave these 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.700
 these streets here the ones that are most 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.930
 near palms and never will 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.850
 will fill with bugs although there is a lot 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.320
 lighting but good you never know 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.990
 well what you said many 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.700
 thanks for the bid for watching the video 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.320
 I hope you liked the map as 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.240
 has updated the server so fast 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.280
 if you have not understood something you already know 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.920
 say any idea to make a 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.580
 tutorial any tutorial sorry 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.230
 goal that language takes too fast 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.950
 Any idea, what does Jce say? 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.610

 idea that I did this tutorial 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.240
 and the map download link will be 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.790
 in the map video so good 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.330
 We already know how to click on the 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.789
