00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
lot of comments mostly that the figure

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.010 
lot of comments mostly that the figure
does<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.670> fact<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.090> lights<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.510> sounds

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
does in fact have lights and sounds

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.740 
does in fact have lights and sounds
which<00:00:22.199> originally<00:00:22.800> mine<00:00:23.160> did<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.630> took

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
which originally mine did not so I took

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.490 
which originally mine did not so I took
the<00:00:25.369> liberty<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> uh<00:00:26.939> well<00:00:27.660> pretty<00:00:28.019> much<00:00:28.199> just

the liberty of uh well pretty much just

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.950 
the liberty of uh well pretty much just
completely<00:00:29.279> disassembling<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> figure<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
completely disassembling the figure I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.540 
completely disassembling the figure I
took<00:00:32.059> went<00:00:33.059> around<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.550> completely

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
took went around here and completely

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.170 
took went around here and completely
took<00:00:36.510> apart<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.440> torso<00:00:38.180> unscrewed

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
took apart the torso unscrewed

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.200 
took apart the torso unscrewed
everything<00:00:39.809> went<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.760> completely

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
everything went in and just completely

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
everything went in and just completely
disassembled<00:00:43.020> him<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> found<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.160> couple<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
disassembled him and found a couple of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.119 
disassembled him and found a couple of
very<00:00:44.910> interesting<00:00:45.120> things<00:00:45.600> first<00:00:46.469> off<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
very interesting things first off the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
very interesting things first off the
electronics<00:00:47.760> inside<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.420> figure<00:00:48.750> were

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
electronics inside on this figure were

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.069 
electronics inside on this figure were
almost<00:00:49.289> completely<00:00:49.739> shot<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.750> speaker

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
almost completely shot and the speaker

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.100 
almost completely shot and the speaker
was<00:00:52.199> missing<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.789> speaker<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> supposed

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
was missing so the speaker is supposed

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.500 
was missing so the speaker is supposed
to<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.520> back<00:00:56.850> right

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to be right here right in the back right

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.250 
to be right here right in the back right
here<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.600> there

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
here so that was just not there

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.219 
here so that was just not there
so<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> went<00:01:02.070> over<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.609> local<00:01:03.229> electronics

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so I went over to a local electronics

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.130 
so I went over to a local electronics
store<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.610> Baltimore<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
bought some more wiring and pulled out

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
bought some more wiring and pulled out
the<00:01:10.650> soldering<00:01:11.189> iron<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.939> bought<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> I

the soldering iron and I bought it I
bought<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.869> speaker<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
bought a speaker which is just a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.390 
bought a speaker which is just a
standard<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.450> electronics<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.560> little

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
standard like electronics a little

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.850 
standard like electronics a little
speaker<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.380> big<00:01:19.680> out

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
speaker it's about about that big out

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
speaker it's about about that big out
the<00:01:20.009> size<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> quarter<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> u.s.<00:01:21.659> quarter

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the size of a quarter or a u.s. quarter

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.640 
the size of a quarter or a u.s. quarter
and<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> rebuilt<00:01:24.299> him<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.320> overall

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and so I rebuilt him and the overall

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.960 
and so I rebuilt him and the overall
effect<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:27.799> we<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:28.979> lights<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.460> sounds

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
effect is we now have lights and sounds

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.490 
effect is we now have lights and sounds
so<00:01:30.450> we're<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> run<00:01:31.020> through<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> lights

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so we're going to run through the lights

00:01:31.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
so we're going to run through the lights
and<00:01:31.619> sounds<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.310> quickly

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.880 

Adam<00:02:02.429> so<00:02:03.429> I<00:02:03.460> have<00:02:03.670> also<00:02:04.000> had<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.479> ton<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.110> size

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
Adam so I have also had a ton of size

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.380 
Adam so I have also had a ton of size
