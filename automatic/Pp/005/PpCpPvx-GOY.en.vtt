00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.489
 very nice that you again look at people who are spending an hour like today 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.829
 rarely get upset when she was there I clearly got through faster 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.980
 but my predecessor video about a song for the same reason 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 I want it to be a bit quieter 100 is the stroke of an optician l 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 can be added as on the first bottle 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.130
 pass with the plugs 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.030
 no come if 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030
 they are also in the foregoing and video 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.720
 sam it starts with a d 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.870
 the stroke goes as follows in the first reason no stress 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.080
 then you go 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 homes 9 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.200
 take 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 also the Netherlands 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 especially in 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 the last attack 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.190
 that is that they actually always follow the standard but briefly in this case 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.680
 not on 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.580
 3 often a employee of a store 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.930
 many a man 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.670
 wdm 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.830
 homes and 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.030
 the Dutchman 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 writer is none 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.760
 the reason 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 I thought about it 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.190
 but we will also be at the fire 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.950
 a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 because a little older 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.969
 you have to practice those for a while 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.989
 then you go on speed and as a task and there comes a protein 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 with you 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.079
 on the third count may year 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.809
 but the attacks and that is too weak is the farmer 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.809
 who is going to take a quick look 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.269
 that is the first rule 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.269
 been the work 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 hair 3 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.429
 the editors 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.309
 Goran 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 we have a big city like what i am with players 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.439
 this is about life 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.439
 not at all 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 why 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.040
 hopefully it is clear success
