 Nandina is a vigorous evergreen shrub, native to Asia, widespread in gardens 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.040
 It is used as a single specimen or to form low hedges; there are dwarf varieties, with a compact development, which does not exceed one meter in height 

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:45.012
 while the botanical species can reach up to two meters, but with not too rapid growth 

00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:56.788
 They prefer very sunny positions, where the new foliage takes on a characteristic reddish bronze color 

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:08.072
 they do not fear the cold and can also be placed in the common garden soil, since they tend to adapt even in non-ideal growing conditions 

00:01:46.587 --> 00:01:54.590
 Recently planted plants should be watered periodically, avoiding to leave them exposed to drought for very long periods of time 

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:09.850
 plants in the home for some years can be satisfied with the water supplied by the weather 

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:16.580
 in case of summer or spring drought it is however good to water the shrubs, at least once a week 

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:25.840
 They generally do not require pruning and are not easily affected by pests or diseases
