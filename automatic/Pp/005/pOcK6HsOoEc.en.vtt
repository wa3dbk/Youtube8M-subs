00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.320
 From time to time the reason in my department has solid minds 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.030
 APTOS Pitch Shorts We only part of the amount of data hardcore pokes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.099
 Uh ... yes we have executed the three u_s_ citizens without trial or because of any 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.029
 But process 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.629
 In any case 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.779
 He was also famous for holding the Attorney-General 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.339
 Uh ... Legal proceedings can not necessarily be a judicial process because of the process being 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.779
 Our hanging man at the base made a decision and that was what it was a couple of nights ago 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.130
 It was a part that did not mean the latter 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.279
 So John Brennan, John S. who is the president before Wallace's top anti-terrorism 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.560
 A quote consultant said 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.300
 If we have a high degree of confidence that innocent civilians will not be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.059
 Wound 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.120
 Or killed 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.770
 Not considered 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.559
 rare 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.430
 But it happened 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.230
 The last words do not sweat in. We almost never kill civilians now and we are now 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.950
 I got this thing for your 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.100
 Except when they do not have calculus 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.620
 As it turns out that there is a new study done by Ah ... 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.740
 A New York University filmmaker then performed 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.320
 And talk to people on the ground in northwest of Paxton 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860
 We have been killed since 2004 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.470
 884 civilians 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.000
 In just a little less than Pakistan 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.940
 Including wonder 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.500
 One hundred and seventy 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.930
 I do not have what we do not kill civilians 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.130
 I did not work very well right 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.390
 So this is a terrible on the props props I'm not against 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.980
 All have built a strike since that President Obama was told about the wars 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.720
 Dom drones strikes 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.870
 First of all we can do signature strikes that's what we have and who we are 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.170
 I do not know who he is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.410
 A strike in the character is when we know who is the signature strike Aden Ala 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.560
 It seems that there were defenders of the skeleton figure out of how they were 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.509
 Later in fact 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.299
 Lorena and Bobbit really do when they kill hundreds in every 60 million 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.800
 children 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.630
 This article is made by enemies out of six families on 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.930
 Who hate you for the rest of their lives 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.020
 He will try to event them in any possible event let alone 800 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.210
 84 not to mention civilians 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.939
 All the places they were doing 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.199
 Unmanned aerial vehicles 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.369
 So you do not draw tried Yes Top Al Qaeda leader I hear you 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.059
 It makes sense to 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.490
 You do not mean to discriminate like through crazy signature strikes 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.519
 Navigating this mania is a double tap 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.139
 The double tap we do is a drone strike from 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.179
 First responders rescuers 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:29.169
 Medical professional is sometimes right 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.769
 We get there 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.219
 Horrible man 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.549
 What is the right thing for an American is someone with no atom of morality 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.549
 To agree with this crazy 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.779
 So far uh look ... a new brave foundation they're doing a great job of 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.769
 These researchers found I was talking to them about what was going on 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.939
 Pakistan because of this 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.319
 Bradenton Herald 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.719
 Top runaway communities 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.560
 People living in the following areas were placed in public expenditure 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.439
 Twenty-four hours a day seven days a week at times 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.639
 In these people who do not know when they will hit those roles they do not know 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.479
 They will hit the result are symptoms 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.609
 Of psychological disorder 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.199
 Of trauma 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.189
 This post has been very concerned 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.999
 We heard stories of people who would not leave their homes 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:28.749
 Now the Republicans will look at them believe that the fall I read their cold terrorism 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:29.700
 for them 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.630
 Now, but wait 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.989
 These are Yeltsin's things 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.609
 Add Pegasus an ally these are civilians who were talking about why we do it 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.909
 If we would like to terrorize them what would make us 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.299
 If you got all the bad guys from on your side 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.000
 Use of interest rates 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.679
 Kill all civilians 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.849
 And terrorizing the rest of the population 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.129
 You know just covering us why they hate us because they hate us because they hate us 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.339
 It could be that or if they were rolled over your head and your family instead 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.489
 All the time you knew she was guilty or innocent 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.119
 You may not like this particular situation 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.639
 And it was not wide open 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.279
 Hit your family members 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.269
 Now what about double taps let's hear about it 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.899
 The people we talked to 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:19.010
 In affected communities without exception almost told us 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.380
 When there is a common right 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.360
 Welcome back then 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.169
 We have heard of some of these so professional medical 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.569
 Well they would not be directed to go by strike if they thought they would get gonna 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.290
 ahead 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.650
 And now again knuckle yeah keep up this head we have right yeah again 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.150
 But about a man 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.729
 If there is a disaster here and someone was injured in your 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:39.680
 Neighborhood 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.020
 What will you do? 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.159
 The most inhumane people rushing and trying to help these people 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.409
 And then it is damaged 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.759
 How so? For more hours 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.919
 I love this country you think about America 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.210
 That's why I'm here becoming a citizen 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.189
 Maybe this is my problem that I really think 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.080
 As I see I think this 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.120
 What America Does 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.889
 What one of the players ends up killing the first responders 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.760
 Why do we think about how and 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.179
 It is counterproductive 

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:19.270
 This was not a deterrent to terror rockets and to allow terrorism 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.349
 This is if anything because it increases 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.350
 He has all these 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.949
 People with the press 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.790
 Let us pinky 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.219
 E childhood how can I get revenge on these guys 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.009
 We were in town on a hill we created the United Nations 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.780
 We did the Marshall Plan we went on the enemies 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.669
 We spread human rights all over the world we were not along but we were only there 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.269
 In this category Alexa did a knot 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:47.139
 And look at what their perception and in this area 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:47.860
 America
