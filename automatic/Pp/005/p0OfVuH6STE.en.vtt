hugely<00:02:15.950> controversial<00:02:16.700> about<00:02:17.360> this

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
hugely controversial about this

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.990 
hugely controversial about this
infiltration<00:02:18.080> program<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.520> people<00:02:19.850> were

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
and in our episode about COINTELPRO we

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.450 
and in our episode about COINTELPRO we
have<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.780> imagine<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.800> time<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.310> which

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
have to imagine the time of which

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.460 
have to imagine the time of which
COINTELPRO<00:02:38.360> took<00:02:38.900> place<00:02:39.170> this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
COINTELPRO took place this

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.250 
COINTELPRO took place this
counterintelligence<00:02:40.840> operations<00:02:41.840> stuff

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
counterintelligence operations stuff

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.340 
counterintelligence operations stuff
from<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.860> 50s<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.640> 70s<00:02:43.940> happened<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.110> we

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
from the 50s to the 70s happened when we

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.840 
from the 50s to the 70s happened when we
were<00:02:45.470> using<00:02:45.680> what<00:02:46.040> might<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.400> well<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.820> been

the technology of cave people because
now<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:50.300> possible<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.709> monitor<00:02:51.980> someone<00:02:52.880> in

now it is possible to monitor someone in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.340 
now it is possible to monitor someone in
real<00:02:53.690> time<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.350> now<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.580> possible<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.780> dig

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
real time and now it is possible to dig

millions of lives no one's arguing that

national security and safety are

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.130 
national security and safety are

disingenuous and they actually serve as

disingenuous and they actually serve as
nothing<00:03:30.140> more<00:03:30.170> than<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> way<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.890> create<00:03:31.550> a

nothing more than a way to create a
police<00:03:32.360> state<00:03:32.840> now<00:03:33.350> think<00:03:33.650> about<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:34.340> brave

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
police state now think about the brave

new world or think about 1984 we get
this<00:03:38.090> sort<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.450> email<00:03:38.870> all<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.320> time<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.920> Matt

this sort of email all the time and Matt
and<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.820> talked<00:03:41.150> about<00:03:41.350> whether<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.950> is

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
and I have talked about whether it is

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.580 
and I have talked about whether it is
actually<00:03:43.850> true<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.330> we<00:03:44.510> want<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.840> throw<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
actually true so we want to throw the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.310 
actually true so we want to throw the
question<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.610> given<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.320> infiltration

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
question to you given that infiltration

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.280 
question to you given that infiltration
is<00:03:49.190> not<00:03:49.489> always<00:03:49.880> illegal<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.720> lot<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.930> cases

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
is not always illegal in a lot of cases

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.620 
is not always illegal in a lot of cases
and<00:03:51.650> will<00:03:52.130> probably<00:03:52.489> be<00:03:52.850> increasingly

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
and will probably be increasingly

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.430 
and will probably be increasingly
prevalent<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.650> future<00:03:55.040> we<00:03:55.640> want<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:56.000> ask

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
prevalent in the future we want to ask

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.530 
prevalent in the future we want to ask
where<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.590> fall<00:03:57.860> in<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.220> debate<00:03:58.430> do<00:03:59.330> you

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
where you fall in this debate do you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.979 
where you fall in this debate do you
think<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.760> infiltration<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:02.209> activist

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
think that infiltration of activist

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.430 
think that infiltration of activist
groups<00:04:03.380> is<00:04:03.830> more<00:04:04.670> for<00:04:04.940> national<00:04:05.660> security<00:04:06.260> or

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
groups is more for national security or

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.390 
groups is more for national security or
do<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.070> think<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.610> is<00:04:07.850> part<00:04:08.239> of<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:09.250> effort<00:04:10.250> of

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
do you think it is part of a effort of

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.910 
do you think it is part of a effort of
control<00:04:11.180> be<00:04:11.750> very<00:04:11.989> careful<00:04:12.380> with<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.650> term

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
control be very careful with the term

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.180 
control be very careful with the term
police<00:04:13.790> state<00:04:14.120> because<00:04:14.480> we<00:04:14.600> have<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.870> ask<00:04:15.500> why

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
police state because we have to ask why

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.610 
police state because we have to ask why
people<00:04:16.760> would<00:04:16.970> want<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.390> control<00:04:18.229> everything

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
