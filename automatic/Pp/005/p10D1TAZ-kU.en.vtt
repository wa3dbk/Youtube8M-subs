actually I'm cooking chicken and the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
actually I'm cooking chicken and the
next<00:00:27.930> two<00:00:28.019> segments<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.650> actually<00:00:29.369> were

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
next two segments you see actually were

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.359 
next two segments you see actually were
shot<00:00:30.300> prior<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.679> actually<00:00:31.920> shot

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
shot prior to this one I actually shot

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.490 
shot prior to this one I actually shot
this<00:00:32.550> segment<00:00:32.940> originally<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.230> just

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
this segment originally and then I just

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200 
this segment originally and then I just
deleted<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> somehow<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.760> I'm<00:00:35.880> pretending

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
deleted it somehow so I'm pretending

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.639 
deleted it somehow so I'm pretending
like<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> very<00:00:36.989> first<00:00:37.170> part<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
like this is the very first part of it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.930 
like this is the very first part of it
and<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> haven't<00:00:37.920> done<00:00:38.129> any<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> other

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and I haven't done any of the other

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
and I haven't done any of the other
stuff<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> even<00:00:39.989> though<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
stuff and even though I have but that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.200 
stuff and even though I have but that
stuff's<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:41.520> too<00:00:41.670> does<00:00:41.940> anything<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
stuff's in there too does anything that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
stuff's in there too does anything that
make<00:00:42.390> sense<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> Quentin

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
make sense it's kind of like a Quentin

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
make sense it's kind of like a Quentin
Tarantino<00:00:44.100> movie<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:44.940> something<00:00:45.210> though<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Tarantino movie or something though it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450 
Tarantino movie or something though it
actually<00:00:45.450> will<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.870> shot<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:47.039> order<00:00:47.250> but

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
actually will be shot in order but

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.630 
actually will be shot in order but

sometime last night

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.259 
sometime last night
six<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.079> in<00:03:22.169> there<00:03:22.290> ate<00:03:22.470> almost<00:03:22.769> almost<00:03:23.340> 24

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
six and it in there ate almost almost 24

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.050 
six and it in there ate almost almost 24
hours<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:25.470> we'll<00:03:25.530> see<00:03:25.650> how<00:03:25.709> long<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.879> if

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
hours so we'll see how long you know if

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.069 
hours so we'll see how long you know if
that<00:03:27.209> makes<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.419> difference<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:27.930> think

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
that makes a difference I really think

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.629 
that makes a difference I really think
it<00:03:28.169> does<00:03:28.349> especially<00:03:29.189> when<00:03:29.459> I've<00:03:29.549> done

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
it does especially when I've done

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.849 
it does especially when I've done
turkeys<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.209> whatnot<00:03:30.870> make<00:03:31.349> out<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.560> brining

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
yeah so yeah that's that was pretty much

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.520 
yeah so yeah that's that was pretty much
it<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.090> cut<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.389> kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.989> straight<00:03:58.229> down<00:03:58.409> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it I cut it kind of straight down the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.199 
it I cut it kind of straight down the
middle<00:03:58.560> on<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:58.979> breastbone<00:03:59.310> left<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
middle on the breastbone left the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.689 
middle on the breastbone left the
breastbone<00:04:00.479> and<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.169> backbone<00:04:01.560> still<00:04:02.040> in

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
breastbone and the backbone still in

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.240 
breastbone and the backbone still in
there<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.540> can<00:04:03.689> take<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.139> or<00:04:04.409> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
there I think you can take one or the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.830 
there I think you can take one or the
other<00:04:05.400> out<00:04:05.669> I<00:04:05.699> think<00:04:06.030> mostly<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.540> can<00:04:06.659> take

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
other out I think mostly you can take

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
other out I think mostly you can take
the<00:04:06.959> backbone<00:04:07.379> out<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:07.769> if<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.549> need<00:04:08.669> to<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.819> may

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
the backbone out if if you need to I may

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.219 
the backbone out if if you need to I may
try<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.389> second<00:04:09.689> time<00:04:09.780> around<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:10.169> is

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
try that the second time around this is

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.020 
try that the second time around this is
mostly<00:04:10.620> just<00:04:10.889> to<00:04:11.069> try<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.609> figure<00:04:11.909> out

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
mostly just to try and figure out

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.179 
mostly just to try and figure out
cooking<00:04:12.509> time<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.530> little<00:04:13.650> bit<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.889> flavor

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
cooking time and a little bit of flavor

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
difficult for me to get a good

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.890 
difficult for me to get a good
temperature<00:05:18.900> reading<00:05:19.380> 158<00:05:19.920> 159<00:05:20.480> 61<00:05:21.480> you<00:05:21.780> want

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
temperature reading 158 159 61 you want

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.880 
temperature reading 158 159 61 you want
to<00:05:21.960> hit<00:05:22.050> about<00:05:22.140> 165<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:24.000> thigh<00:05:24.290> 163<00:05:25.970> 163

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
to hit about 165 and the thigh 163 163

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.450 
to hit about 165 and the thigh 163 163
664<00:05:29.090> like<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.960> couple<00:05:31.230> more<00:05:31.710> minutes<00:05:32.100> and

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
664 like just a couple more minutes and

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.020 
664 like just a couple more minutes and
then<00:05:32.580> it'll<00:05:32.760> be<00:05:32.850> good<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.120> go<00:05:33.500> 164<00:05:34.500> -<00:05:34.770> so<00:05:35.280> anyway

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
then it'll be good to go 164 - so anyway

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.120 
then it'll be good to go 164 - so anyway
yeah<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:36.540> we'll<00:05:36.690> maybe<00:05:36.900> show<00:05:37.230> it<00:05:37.290> inside<00:05:37.620> how

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
yeah and we'll maybe show it inside how

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.530 
yeah and we'll maybe show it inside how
we<00:05:38.190> cut<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:38.490> up<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:39.030> be<00:05:39.150> awesome

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540
